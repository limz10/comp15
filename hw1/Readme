This program creates two rectangles and reports their areas, perimeters, 
and whether square or not.

Files include rectangle.h rectangle.cpp rectangleTester.cpp

Use included Makefile to compile it

Data structure and algorithm for this program are simple.  I decided not to 
waste my time explaining, but you get the idea that I am aware of the
importance of this readme file and it will absolutely benefit me eventually.
