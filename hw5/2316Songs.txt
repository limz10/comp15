All Gone Wrong 
Wanna tell a story 'bout a girl named Sheila
Lovely li'l thing but a bit of a dreamer
She's been married for three long years
Got three children and they're all little dears, but
Now she's bored with her married bliss, so
She goes out on the town, has a bit of this and that
The guy meant nothing, one night stand
Test turned blue, got much more on her hands
Uh-oh, it's all gone wrong, and
Uh-oh, it's all gone wrong, and
Uh-oh, it's all gone wrong
It's all gone wrong
Derrick knew she worked at the supermarket
So while out on a drive decided to go and park it
Down by the river, walk to the store
Never got the courage up to talk to her before, but
He'd been up practising all last night
Planning what he's gonna say, making sure it sounded right
As he turned the corner by the milk and orange juice
She's playing tonsil hockey with the spotty guy from fresh produce
Jon was a guy that fully understood, that
The car that you drive is an extension of your manhood
As you can imagine, never left no doubt
Enter the equation when he drove his Cadillac about
Pretty damn long, pretty damn wide
Two silver lightning bolts painted down the sides
Imagine his grief, pity his pain, when
Both broke down one morning and never started up again
Fred played guitar in his best mate's band
They knew that they'd go far, all they needed was a helping hand
While practising one evening, there's a knock at the door
Opened up to see a guy, no one there had seen before
Introduced himself as 'Bob the talent-scout'
Handed them a form, told them they should fill it out
Now they're still practising in Fred's back room
Owe ten thousand quid, Bailiffs will be calling soon

All She Ever Wants 
Wanna tell you 'bout a girl I know
For this we'll call her Sandy
She's got legs up to her armpits
And her voice is sweet like candy
She's an angel
Head over heels but you can't tell
You know you love her but
You wanna keep your distance
There's just one big problem
And that's her damn persistence
And I know her
It's just one smile bowls you over
And you may well put up a fight
But she's still gonna stay the night
It's all that she ever wants
And then she gets inside your head
You won't remember what you said
It's all that she ever wants
And then she crawls inside your skin
You won't know what a mess you're in
It's all that she ever wants
And no she hasn't got a clue
Of what the hell she wants to do
Well she's not even faithfull
But you don't even blame her
If you were that fine then
You would be the same and
You don't own her
But ask her nicely and she'll show ya
When you first met her
The match was made in heaven
Little did you know
You were the fifth one out of seven
But you still stay there
And you're still acting like you don't care
She's still deciding
What it is she wants to do
But you know that her long term plans
Don't include you
But you're still hoping
It's your special way of coping
She absent minded and
She may forget your name
But your caught up in her
And you love just the same
There's no denying
You know you're getting close to crying
She's inside your head, you won't know what you've said
She's inside your head, you might as well be dead

Angel With A Pint Glass 
I remeber when I sw you, you were standing by the bar.
I didnt now what to say to you, so I spied you from afar.
You're Like an angel with a pint glass, Aphrodite with a beer
I remember thinking at the time, "So what the hell's she doing here?".
So now I'm sitting hom and watching rain go down my window pain,
I wish I'd never got the courage up to go ask you your name.
And now im sitting home and watching rain go down my window pain,
You helped me get into this mess so wont you help me out again.
If I asked you nicely would you want to take me home,
I've been staring at you for hours and I think that you're alone.
Oh, could you be my valentine, or can i have this dance,
Thing is you're so perfect, well I dont stand a chance.
So now I'm sitting hom and watching rain go down my window pain,
I wish I'd never got the courage up to go ask you your name.
And now im sitting home and watching rain go down my window pain,
You helped me get into this mess so wont you help me out again.
I know they say that love hurts, but you didnt have to hurt me,
I would have taken your word for it, I trusted you completely.
I got your number in my pocket, I could give you a call,
The only problem with that plan is I dont like you at all.
So now I'm sitting hom and watching rain go down my window pain,
I wish I'd never got the courage up to go ask you your name.
And now im sitting home and watching rain go down my window pain,
You helped me get into this mess so wont you help me out again.
So now I'm sitting hom and watching rain go down my window pain,
I wish I'd never got the courage up to go ask you your name.

Best Mate's Girlfriend 
I've been thinking about my mate's girlfriend
In a way I shouldn't be
Wondering 'bout the way she'd look
Posing like they do in books
Wearing very little, except maybe a grin
I could bring a bottle her boyfriend I could throttle
And while he's out the way I can jump right in
'Cause
Wish that I was sleeping with my best mate's girlfriend
I don't wanna go
She want's me to stay
But, my mate is getting in the way
If he'd should go out to the kitchen
That would give me time just to get a kiss in
If he should go to the garage instead
Well that'll give me time to get her into bed
Do it on the double or we'll get into trouble
And he'll make a punching bag outta my head
I'm sure that I've seen her winking
And I'm sure she's thinking what I'm thinking
I'd sure like to get to know her better
Especially what lies beneath that sweater
Fed up of thinking about it in dreams
I wanna know what really lies beneath your jeans

Break Up 
Hey there's something I wanna share
I'll tell you even though you don't care
Think of all the good times you're gonna have
Don't dwell on the bad times that just makes me mad
Well the sun is shining bright today
Less weight on your head 'cos you managed to get away
Now you've got your freedom, now you've got your chance
Don't just sit around man
Get on your feet, get off your ass
Why can't you just look ahead
Stop dwelling on the bitchy things she said, I know
You've gotta walk before you run
Don't just dream it, go and live it
C'mon bring it on
Hey there's something you need to know
You'll get there, but things are moving kind of slow
Now it's time to try out, things missed in the past
Don't just sit around man
Get on your feet, get off your ass
Well there's hope in your heart today
Living for yourself and you know it's never been this way
Now she's out for good and it's time to sing and dance
Don't just sit around man
Get on your feet, get off your ass
But please take my advice
Don't try and act too nice
Because you don't get chances to make mistakes twice
Hey, there's one thing that's real clear
You're better off without her around here
Nice to have you back and having fun at last
Don't just sit around man
Get on your feet, get off your ass

Disco Kid 
Well, don't follow me 'cos I ain't no saviour
Got bad habits, don't look good on paper

But I'm doing fine so it must quite suit me
No I know what it is that you're trying to do to me
But it won't work
Gotta find another way
Gotta find another way
Gotta find another way
Well people that know me say I'm lazy
That's not true, well OK, maybe
It's not just that I'm bone idle
The mentioning of hard work makes me go suicidal
I've been hearing lots of stories

Hey, what the hell is wrong with you
Come on and join the queue
If you wanna get off
Yeah, there's an invisible border
Come closer where it's warmer

Maybe we could be the ones to make you happy
Hell you never know you might even smile
Maybe we could be the ones to get a little bit of you and put it to some use
Even if it's only just for while
Hey, come on and join the party
It's only just started
So you haven't missed much
All that you want is peace and quiet
But we're kicking u a riot
In your own back yard
Hey, everybody now lets go

Ego 
Hey, Kate, you and me should make a date
To have a little loving in the back row
Tell your mum you're gonna have a lot of fun
But don't tell daddy, that's a no-no
Hope it won't offend, maybe you could bring a friend
We could have more fun with three
If she's up for some, you could even bring your mum
She's kinda cute and she's got a thing for me
All you ever think about is me, me, me
And I can understand it
My ego's got so big lately
Swear that you could see it standing on another planet
I would've thought you'd have noticed
My ego's too big
Yeah I'm the host with the mostest
My ego's too big
Don't tell me you haven't noticed
My ego's too big
Hi, I'm the host with the mostest
Hey teach, remember when you used to preach
'Gonna have to stop that, if you wanna do well'
As a rule always had to act a fool
But look at me now, shows you never can tell
Now you're finally listening to me, me, me
And that's not how you planned it
My ego's got so big lately
Swear that you could see it standing on another planet
Maybe you think we're guilty of having rock-star attitudes
Maybe you're just jealous 'cos you've seen our faces in the news
Maybe it's just that you're out of practise
Hell yeah! Taking that for granted
Spend most of the year, living out a suitcase
The only sleep we get is when we're travelling to the next place
Hell yeah! I miss my family
But I've got all my best friends right here around me
And it's worth for that one hour
Get up on stage and feel that power
Me and you have got this understanding
Better clear the floor
My ego's coming in for landing

Friend Called Fred 
I think I'm going slightly mad
It might be all the dreams I've had
It could be all the things I've seen
All the things I wish I'd been
I'd like to introduce you
My friend called Fred, you got one too
He's the guy who tells you what to do
He's the one who knows better than you
I kinda find it hard to sleep
So I try my hand at counting sheep
But all I got was repetition
You can't get to sleep by doing addition
My friend called Fred is always right
He gets the last word every night
But now that really is a pain
'Cause what he says is all the same
My imaginary friend
Many's the time I wanna kill ya
Know I shouldn'y moan
But you're always there when I wanna be alone
My friend called Fred is never bored
He just steals what he can't afford
And no he never gets the blame
'Cause he just uses a false name
Look at this guy who's stood by me
It's obvious he's out his tree
He's acting like a crazy man

And all you wanna do is get along
Helping people across the road and doing what the hell you're told

What ever happened to the way it used to be
Where all you wanted was anarchy
Where rules were only made to get 'em wrong
I don't know, maybe I'm bold, I don't like doing what I'm told
I don't really want to get along
I'm not saying it's bad , just that some things make me sad
When I think of them as dead and gone
People try and live too fast, just one life make it last
There's no need to rush to get along
I enjoy things I've got, even when they're not a lot
Main goal in my life is have a laugh
I don't know, even though I'm older
Still don't like doing what I'm told
I don't really wanna get along
I'm just here to have fun, not to dictate anyone

Go away
Far away

Live Another Day 
Woke up this morning feeling like I've been run over
My head feels like I've been going solo with a brick
Crawl to the bathroom, grab the sink, the shower's running
Takes all my will power to stop myself from being sick
I don't know why I always do this to myself
You would've thought I'd learnt my lesson ages ago
I don't know what the hell I got up to last night
But if it carries on I know I haven't got long to go
I'm not in the best of health
But I have done it to myself
I'm not in the best of health
But I can't help that
Went to the doctors
Said I'm coming down with something
And I'm afraid it might lead to a heart attack
He looked me over, gave me his expert opinion
Gave me two tablets and said
"Get lost and don't come back"
I know it's not what you wanna hear
But if you'd just lay off the beer
Then you would live to see another day
If this was a cartoon
Then this song might have a moral, something like
"Don't you go down the same road that I went"
But as it is I'm enjoying myself, getting wasted
Until I don't then the moral thing can go get bent!

Lyrical Content 
You're so intent with my lyrical content,
that you probably don't realise exactly what I meant.
It may not be up there with J.R.R Tolkien.
But at least you don't need a PhD to understand what I mean
If you're the kind of guy who reads between the lines,
you probably drive a Volvo car and read Financial Times.
It's not about how clever or witty the prose.
It's more about the feel of the song and making sure it flows.
My lyrical content
There's nothing wrong with writing total nonsense lyrics,
I don't have to please anyone, especially not the cynics.
If your the kind of guy who likes to know what's wrong,
I'd rather put a smile on your face and help you bounce along.
Nothing makes us happier than smiling, bouncy faces
so we have to get our music heard in lots of different places.
It's not about how clever or witty the prose,
it's more about the feel of the song and making sure it flows.
My lyrical content
Heard some people saying that you had a sense of humour,
there may well be some truth in that but I think it's a rumour.
Said I get most of my lyrics from Peter and Jane,
I tried using Thesaurus but the songs came out the same.
Like to think we're standing on the funny side of crazy,
our future's looking bright although the past's a little hazy.
It's not about how clever or witty the prose,
it's more about the feel of the song and making sure it flows.

Nothing To Hide 
You will come to realise that your life is like a book
Someone's always noting the route you took
But I want you
To know that I've got nothing to hide
If you've got somebody buried underneath your patio
You can bet your life that your neighbours know
And I want you
To know that I've got nothing to hide
All those things I've done
All those things I've said
I wanna tell you that I've got nothing to hide
I got no regrets
At least I haven't yet
I wanna tell you that I've got nothing to hide
OK there was a problem I had back in '92
But that got cleared up and the rash did too
And I want you to know
That I've got nothing to hide
I've been called a liar, a cheater and a whore
I've been called a slut and a whole lot more
But I want you
To know that I've got nothing to hide
I'm not lying and I'm sure
She didn't mean a thing to me
And nor did the other three
Skeletons in closets are common place I know
But please don't hang your dirty laundry on show
And I want you
To know that I've got nothing to hide

No Woman No Cry 
[Al's Lyrics]
Do you remember a few years ago
When they used to play this song yeah?
We decided, it was much too slow
So we've gone and upped the tempo
We say
Everything's gonna be alright now
Everything's gonna be just fine
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be just fine
Everything's gonna be alright now
Everything's gonna be just fine
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be just fine
So we went back
Did a bit of thinking, did a lot of drinking too
And we came to this conclusion
If you want it, you gotta go for it, don't care 'bout who is who
And you've got the best solution
We say
Everything's gonna be alright now
Everything's gonna be just fine
Everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be just fine
Everything's gonna be alright now
Everything's gonna be just fine
Everything's gonna be alright
It's gonna be just

Ode To Slimy Bassless 
You've got your Volvo and yor little mortgage.
All your things of value all wrapped up in storage.
You've got 2.4 children named Dick and Jane.

You've got a dog named Rover, a cat named Moggy,
You're wife wont let you in the car if it gets a little foggy.

You happy just to sit home, your feet up by the fire.
It's OK to spend all of your fridays down the pub,
But you should have drawn the line at joining the caravan club,
You'd Rather stay home and watch T.V. than come out and socialise with li'l ol' me.
I dont wanna be the one to say that you got boring,
But when you start talking people start yawning.

You think you're wifes at bingo but she's here with me instead,
You wouldnt misunderstnad her if you just listened to what she said.

Rockabilly 
You ever felt like you're gonna chuck up
You try to speak but it comes out mucked up
Well that's just the way she made me feel
I know I shoudn't, no I shouldn't pull her hair
But it's a kids sign of affection
And I still ain't got nowhere
I sat behind her in almost every lesson
She drove me mad with that gingham dress on
And those little ribbons in her hair
She had a brother in the year above her
So I wrote, told him that I bugged her
He got all my stuff stuck in a tree
Yes I confess, I may well be a pest
But I'm not gonna change, so let it go...
She had a brother and he threatened to hit me
So I turned round and ran home quickly
Hid under the stairs for quite a while
I like to remember my days at school
I always was the classroom fool
Best thing about playtime was kiss chase
Yelling swear words with your mates
Not finding out what it meant till it's too late
And you're grounded for the day
Giving your mate's an atomic wedge
Or finding pornos in the hedge
Ringing doorbells and running away

Room For Abuse 
We'd like to say a thank you to our mums and dads
And all our families for all of the support we have
We'd like to give a big thank you to all of our mates
And all the people that have let us stay, you treated us great
We'd like to give a special mention to some of the crews
Cool promoters, yeah, the ones that gave us extra booze
And thanks a lot to all the good, good bands we know
We know without you, there probably wouldn't be a show
Now for some, a select few
We'd like to give a big fuck you
You like to think you're so damn punk rock
But really you don't give a fuck
We aren't naming any names
'Cause we ain't playing silly games
Just cause you're so damn petty
Doesn't mean we have to be
Promoters that have ripped us off
'Cause the just want a bigger cut
People say we aren't trad ska
We never said that we are
We don't mind if you don't like us
Just fuck off, get on your bike 'cause
We won't argue, it's no use
It just gives us more room for abuse
A great big thank you to the skaters and the kids and the punks
And all the people that are always there down at the front
Thanks to the people at the gigs for coming to it
And all the head cases that always go mad in the pit
We wanna say a huge thank you for the tabs and beer
We know without you we wouldn't have survived the year
We wanna say a thank you if you lent a hand
We know without you that there probably wouldn't be a band
Now there's a few people that we wanna list
Please excuse us if there's any that we have missed
We wanna give a real special mention to Hogger
You treated us well man, you're like a big brother
We know without people out you, this would mean nought
We'd like to thank Chip, Phil and all the rest for support
If we've forgotten anyone that has helped us out
We'd like to thank you 'cause that's what this is all about

Roving Eye 
My mother told me that I would get stronger if,
I could just keep my attention for a little longer on
One girl, any girl, just a normal kind of girl,
take time to ponder but that girl, any girl,
I'll give anything a twirl, I tend to wander
and I wish I didn't have a Rov- ingeye
Every girl in this place looks good to me, me, me.
Every girl in this place looks good enough to eat, eat, eat.
Every girl in this place looks good to me, me, me.
Every girl in this place looks good enough to eat, eat, now..
When I go out drinking I try to be good but,
I find myself flirting with people that I know I shouldn't,
Tall ones, short ones, 'specially the taut ones, I love them all,
With their long hair, short hair wearing almost underwear, say less is more.
And I wish I didn't have a roving eye......
Every girl in this place looks good to me, me, me.
Every girl in this place looks good enough to eat, eat, eat.
Every girl in this place looks good to me, me, me.
Every girl in this place looks good enough to eat, eat, now..
Well I'm here to tell ya that it can be trouble,
If you're going steady don't bother going for the double,
It's hard not to look, like a fish on a hook, surrounded by ladies.
The best way that I find, to get that image out your mind, is talk about babies.
And I wish I didn't have a roving eye......

Santeria 
I don't practice santeria got no crystal ball
I had a million dollars but I'd spend it all
I could find that heina and that sancho that she's found
I'd pop a cap in sancho and I'd smack her down
All I really wanna say
I can't say it's love I need
But my soul will have to wait till I get back and find
heina of my own
Daddy's gonna love one and all
I feel the break and I got to live it out
I swear that I really wanna know
All I really wanna say is I got mine and I make it
Yes, I'm comin' up
Tell sanchito that if he knows what is good for him
he best go run and hide
Daddy's got a new .45
And I won't think twice to put that barrel straight
down sancho's throat
Believe me when I say that I got somethin for his punk ass
What I really wanna say is there's just one way back
And I'll make it but my soul will have to wait

Second Rate 
[A duet w/ Laila Khan of Grimace]
I love the way
You never stop your frowning
But if I saw you drowning
I wouldn't waste my time to rescue you
I love the way
You eat soup with your fingers
The way your odour lingers
For hours after you have left the room
Love the way that even though we fight
We know that it'll be all right
I know why we get on so great
We're second rate
Love the way
You never give up trying
But when you're old and dying
I won't be the one to care for you
I love the way
You live life on the sofa
You're as lively as a coma
I should've told you long ago we're through
Love the way that even though we fight
We know that it'll be all right
I know why we get on so great
We're second rate
We're OK
Oh, you really think so?
To be honest I just don't know

Here comes that guy with shiny teeth. A nicer guys easy to meet.
Nuge you with a bony elbow and tell you something you dont wanna know.

If I hear much morecrap them my ears gonna melt.
By the end of the night it'll end in a fight, I just can't help myself.
He's got his tan straight from a tub, it glows bright orange in a club.
Talk the hind legs of a donkey, his voice drones on its all inione key.

Wake Up Call 
I must admit I hate the mornings
I wish that they had never invented it
And skipped straight to the evening bit
It would make much more sense 'cos
Nothing ever happens in the morning
You sit around it can get quite boring for some
And you never get anything done
'Cos you're feeling to bad
I wanna share with you a little problem
I have trouble getting out of bed
I'd rather just sleep instead
Oh God I hate mornings
I have to have at least a cup of coffee
If I haven't, don't bother talking to me
In fact make that two or three
Before you try to approach me
When I do wake up it's never worth it
Cold pizza, beer and fag butts by the bed
There's a battle going on your head
Mornings are so overrated
What I wanna know, what I gotta know
Is why the hell I got up out of bed
When I could be laying in and sleeping instead

Well you need someone to show you life ain't that bad
Stop moaning, your whinings driving me mad.

But its really dull 'cause you haven't got the history.

Theres plenty of people in this world who'd like the life that you got.

Stop moaning, your whinings driving me mad.

Braided Hair 
Yo we was talking earlier and I was telling you talking bout life
I feel like life is like braided hair
Its sorta like twist you know
Bout braided hair like twist
You know three strands twist together
Ultimately you get to where you wanna get to
From the same dirt from the heels of my ancestors
The naked roads and the fields where the pain festered
And I wonder where the hold came from
In the deeps of my heart make me yearn for the drum
It's the same place where the cross is burned
The same place where the loss was earned
It's the place where the floss was yearned
Gold teeth and bling ice on the ring baby sure
We've all got things that hang at the back
Things that make us cool,
Things that make us whack,
Things that make us mad
Things we wish we never had done
But they're just the things that make us real
Not the maps to guide where we go from here
The road twists and braids our hair
Until we all get there
I like that I don't know some mysteries
Ancient things and beginnings
Excited about the day when I don't have to hear all the theories
My scalp needs some grease
It's the same place where the crosses burned
The same place where the loss was earned
The only way we all can learn
Is if we have these braids with the twist and turns so
Walking in the race of life
Looking for my own pace
Not always wanting to but I have to
Sometimes feeling like I've bitten off much more than I could chew
But the wind goes though my hair
Lifts me up with ease not a crease
Hair full of grease no weave embracing me
It's you I see
I am you and you are me I see yeah
I am you and you are me I see
We might survive as brothers ye

My Culture 
I'm the sum total of my ancestors 
I carry their DNA 
We are representatives of a long line of people 
And we carried them around either with 
This long line of people 
That goes back to the beginning of time 
And when we meet - they meet other lines of people 
And we say bring together the lines of me.
-Maxi Jazz: 
When I look back over the years 
at the things that brought tears to my eyes 
papa said we have to be wise 
to live long lives 
now i recognise 
what my father said before he dies 
vocalise things I've left unsaid 
left my spirit unfed for too long 
I'm coming home to my family 
Where i can be strong 
Be who I planned to be 
Within me my ancestory 
Givin'me continuity 
Would it be remiss to continue in this way 
would you rather I quit 
come with the other shit 
making people's hips sway 
lip service I pay but i'm nervous 
i pray for all the mothers who get no sleep 
like a lifeline I light lines cause my compassion is deep 
for the people who fashioned me my soul to keep 
and this is who i happen to be 
and if I don't see that I'm strong then I wont be 
This is what my Daddy told me 
I wished he would hold me 
A little more 
than he did 
But he taught me my culture 
And how to live positive 
I never wanna shame 
The blood in my veins and bring pain 
to my sweet grandfathers face 
in his resting place 
I make haste to learn and not waste 
everything my forefathers earned in tears 
for my culture

Hello Dad, remember me? 
I'm the man you thought I'd never be. 
I'm the boy who you reduced to tears 
Dad I'd been lonely for 27 years 
Yeah, that's right my name's Bob 
I'm the one who landed the popstars job 
I'm the one who you told : look, don't touch? 
and the kid who wouldn't amount to much. 
I believe in the senses out of sound 
I have always been too loud 
wont you help me drown it out? 
I'm what I feel 
and what I'm feeling is surreal 
I'm a massive spinnin' wheel s'always digging in my heels. 
Now I got the faith to 
Fall back again 
Crawl from the warm water 
water to air 
you're on your feet again 
your feet again. 
- Maxi Jazz: 
Hah, lace up your booty 
Going back to the roots continue my interlude 
Feed freaking for loot 
And my spell's been to check what your future brings is now 
and your forefathers further know How 
but now what happened to the world without the hatred 
Use your head if the needle is wise be the thread 
And weave ancestral wisdom yours by best 
spreading the lords word over this broad earth

And to all of you I'm just another ghost dude
Floating along haunting pointlessly
Seems everyone is haunting something but me
Everyone is haunting me

But when I take off my white sheet
It's then I become unseen
I'm exposed without the blindfold of lies
Because those two holes are too small for human eyes
And I'll walk, not float to oblivion
Because that's who I am, not for the nation
Everyone is haunting me

If you don't know I'm gonna let it be known, Im still in the penetration zone

Head's always cloudy, words is lies

Sipping life from a jack daniels bottle of sin 
Daydreaming fazes walls caving in

Life In The Suburbs 
Suburban Life aint what it seems
Suburban life the American dream
Suburban life so pretty and clean
Suburban life aint what it seems
Now my dad bought the system, American dreamer
Bought a new home and a brand new Beamer
But it didn't long for things things to fall apart
Because the system that he bought has no heart
From the bills for days hes got blood shot eyes
The American dream was a pack of lies
6 months later Municipal court
Divorce time baby, child support
I went from home cooked meals to TV dinners
No more little Mike now its the punk,the sinner
There's no cash back cause there was no receipt
Man suburban life aint the life for me
Suburban Life aint what it seems
Suburban life the American dream
Suburban life so pretty and clean
Suburban life aint what it seems
Gave in a little deeper to the third degree
More drugs, real punks, and wannabe's
Soldiers of the burbs all feel deceived
America! What? Land of the green
Now you got problems I got mine too
There's not enough cops for my whole crew
Cause when we drink we drink to get away
To elevate from this world of hate, never perpetrate
I don't want no degree selling herbs on the burbs
On every street
No real jobs for the PTB, So what's it gonna be?
Grand minority!
Suburban Life aint what it seems
Suburban life the American dream
Suburban life so pretty and clean
Suburban life aint what it seems
Now broken homes inside every house
Neighbors yellinh, can't work it out
I said beaten wives, tweaked out nights
what a feeling ooh what a life
Now you cant turn back the hands of time
So let me tell you about the highest friend of mine
His name is Greg , king of the crops
deep dark axe,hates all preps
Philly blunt placed behind his ear
Two young girls and a Heineken beer
And this is just and everyday thing
Dad comes home telephone rings
Its lenny and you know hes riding rich
Leapin' like some frogs trunk full of hogs
Trunk full of skates, dirt bikes and rakes
What ever we could get we was gonna take
Just like the pirates of the Caribbean
Neighborhood watch don't like what they're seeing
Ha ha ha we got it like that

SuperGirl 
o well here is me on tragedy
i always want whats out of reach
she pulles dyed brown hair back and signs
so fuck that night out with the guys

the telephone doesnt scare me anymore
your home and i am here alone my dear
always stupidly sarcastic my hyper spastic superhero grl
so break the bruised monogamy
and let him fade to memory
your erotic wet atomic eyes keep reoccurrin in my mind
do me a favor please and touch your lips to mine...

With You 
It dosen't matter what we do 
just as long as I'm with you 
I'd do the same thing every day 
I've never felt like this before 
you keep me coming back for more 
and you know I meant to stay 
I think about when we first met 
the night I never will forget 
I couldn't keep my eyes off you 
A classic case of boy meets girl 
you smiled at me and changed my world 
now I feel that way times two 
When you hang out with me tonight 
I'm sure my day will be alright 
if I see your pretty face 
And every second that goes by 
I think of all the reasons why 
my life gets better everyday 
When I'm with you, When I'm with you 
When I'm with you, When I'm with you 
When I'm with you 
When I'm with you, When I'm with you 
When I'm with you, When I'm with you 
It dosen't matter what we do 
just as long as I'm with you 
I'd do the same thing every day 
I've never felt like this before 
You keep me coming back for more 
And I hope you feel the same 
When I'm with you, When I'm with you 
When I'm with you, When I'm with you 
When I'm with you 
When I'm with you, When I'm with you

Deal With It 
...and we go!
When I woke up on the sunset when it really should be dawn,
I thought I had no brains...when I really had no brawn.
Took it from the bottom, I should take it from the top,
I had another thrill, had another thrill when I thought I had my lot
Well I don't know what I do because I do as I know,
I gotta show for what I've got or I cannot find home. Whhhoooooaaaaoooohhh
(Ya gotta) Deal with it, Deal with it.
(Ya) Deal with it, Deal with it.
(Ya) Deal with it, Deal with it.
(Ya) Deal with it, Deeeeeeeeeeeeal...
I rolled a thought around my eyes, it should be in my head,
Got buried in Nevada...when I wasnt even dead.
All around me were the adults asking kids for cash,
When I saw a green police car, I thought I'd make a dash.
Well I don't know what I do because I do as I know,
I gotta show for what I've got or I cannot find home. Whhhoooooaaaaoooohhh
(Ya gotta) Deal with it, Deal with it.
(Ya) Deal with it, Deal with it.
(Ya) Deal with it, Deal with it.
(Ya) Deal with it, Deeeeeeeeeeeeal...with it.
Ya Deal with it, woahoohhoohh,

So Wrong So Long 
So tell me why you're here,
Do you still hold me dear?
When you're the one that walked away from me but that's okay,
Did you think all this through?
I thought about it too,
But I can't waste my life away on love that isn't true.
Are you still holding on?
When I did I was wrong,
To think you'd ever take another chance of losing me.
So now where do we stand?
You say that I'm your man,
But you won't tell me everything,
And I don't think you can.
I never thought I was anything,
But you showed me I'm wrong,
For that I'll thank you always and always.
Memories of yesterday,
All the things I couldn't say,
To make you understand how I feel now,
And time is moving way too fast to sit and contemplate the past again,
But I'll thank you always!
GO
I never thought I was anything,
But you showed me I'm wrong,
For that I'll thank you always and always.
Always, and I'll thank you always.
Always, and I'll thank you always.

Another girl to make me feel alright
There could be no other girl here but you
May be you will understand that I love you
Everywhere I look around I see your face

OH NO
Wish there could be something that I could do
Coz tonite baby I'm gonna party all nite

If I love you more
I'm really wasting my time
Everybody tells me that you have found another
So tonite is the nite I'm gonna party all nite
I'll try to live my own life

You'd always tell me that I'm the one for you
I believe in everything that you did

Everywhere I look around I see your face

At The End 
remember back in 93'
it was him and him and you and me
we all hung out in the hallway
remember our good old school yard days
we didnt care about time or money
we just had fun and played hookey
we all got closer together
we treated eachother like brothers
but as the time went by, ive come to realise
our friendships not the same
theres really no one to blame
here we are, staring at
at the end of something good
here we are, staring at
at the end of brother hood
here we are, staring at
the end of something good
here we are, staring at
the end of brother hood
we always had eachothers back
no matter what differences we may of had
we all went out separate pathes
just thinking about it makes me sad
why dont we go on our friends
it isnt that bad, its at the end
what about all those times
brother hood is a crime.
but as the time went by, ive come to realise
our friendships not the same
theres really no one to blame
here we are, staring at
at the end of something good
here we are, staring at
at the end of brother hood
here we are, staring at
the end of something good
here we are, staring at
the end of brother hood
and all this time,
ive been thankful for having friends like you
it will never get to my mind,
as you, this is what it comes to
but i just have to face the facts
that nothing in this world is really meant to last
here we are, its where were at.
here we are again.
here we are, staring at
at the end of something good
here we are, staring at
at the end of brother hood
here we are, staring at
the end of something good

No fear at all, no sin 
The illusion do not need 
Every moment is the last 
To be dead for next time 
Love the death as the life 
Constantness is the right 
Love the Death as the Life

Every form is different, separated one 
Love to be in joy, beginnig in end

Comme une peau sur la peau dans le noir
Accroupie sur le sentier

Veux tu venir avec moi
Rechercher ce bruit si rare et si doux
Je te guide de ma voix
Au travers des herbes folles
C'est un pige de sauvageonne
Une promesse  tenir cette fosi
Laisse les voix qui t'appellent
Contenter les innocents
Au dessus de l'eau
Y'avait un bateau
Si beau si grand si loin
Au dessus de l'eau
Sur le grand miroir
Si blanc, si chaud, si noir

Quand tu viendras avec moi
Mlanger tes traces et perdre ton souffle

La nuit qui pousse le jour
Elle vient chercher ses rveurs dans le noir
Comem chaque soir elle est l, y'a plus qu'a
Assez de bruit, assez de gris
Assez de rues assez, ca suffit
Les jeux des enfants se sont eteints fatigus

C'est elles qui guettaient mon retour au pays du temps perdus
Assez de bruit, assez de rues
Assez de gris assez, ca suffit
Assez de dire oui quand c'est non, assez suffit
Assez de cris et de nuits sans sommeil

Oh laissez moi aller
Courir sur les sentiers
Fouler l'herbe mouille
J'entends les projets qui m'appellent
Ils se plaignent de la poussire
Et des journes trop remplies tard dans le soir
C'est elles qui me cassent et me brisent mon retour au temps perdu

Faire s'envoler tous ceux

On peut souffler
Aussi fort tous ensemble
Essayons la paresse
La dernire de nos armes
On veux souffler

La meilleure des matresses
Pour lui qui les avait toutes perdues.

Les Glycines 
Sur les murs y'avaient des glycines
Sur les murs y'avaient des glycines
Toi tu portais un tablier bleu
Toi tu portais un tablier
Toujours le nez dans tes bassines
Toujours le nez dans tes bassines
En ce temps-l on se parlait peu
En ce temps-l on se taisait
C'est pas de l'amour pauvre Martha
C'est pas de l'amour mais a viendra
Parat que cousin et cousine
Parat que cousin et cousine
Ca ne doit pas s'aimer d'amour non
Ca ne doit pas parler d'amour
Alors on parlait du beau temps,
De la pluie et des fleurs des champs
De la vendange et du labour mais
On ne parlait jamais d'amour
C'est pas de l'amour pauvre Martha
C'est pas de l'amour mais a viendra
Puis je suis parti en usine
Puis je suis parti en usine
Je ne voulais pas tre fermier moi
Je voudrais tre le premier
Merci beaucoup petit Jesus
J'ai bien manger et j'ai bien bu
Je suis aim ou respect moi
On me dit "vous" pour me parler
C'est pas de l'amour pauvre Martha
C'est pas de l'amour mais a viendra
Pourtant quand je vois des glycines
Pourtant quand je vois des glycines
J'ai envie de les arracher moi
J'ai envie de les arracher
Parat que t'aurais eu deux filles
Qui font partie de ma famille
Mais comme l'amour ne me dis plus rien
Elles n'auront jamais de cousins
C'est pas de l'amour pauvre Martha
C'est pas de la haine mais a viendra

Le Silence 
Quand le plancher de la scne
Qui est sous nos talons
Aura brl aux grands chantiers de la raison
Quand on se sera essoufls
A vouloir tout casser
Quand pour survivre
Il n'y aura qu'une seule faon
Quand on aura dpos une gerbe  nos rancoeurs
Quand le temps sera revenu
De rentrer dans le rang
Le silence, silence est d'or
On s'crase encore plus fort, toujours plus fort
A qui les torts,  en rveiller nos morts
Le silence, silence aidant
Ceux qui mouftent seront de jeunes morts
Pour la nation, au nom de l'ordre
Il y aura mon nom
Le silence, silence nous guette
Le bruit qui coure, nous inquite
Toujours plus fort, encore plus fort
Oh, je crie encore plus fort

Les Petites Gosses 
Quand je suis parti c'?tait des petites gosses
Elles roulaient leurs tresses en chignons de n?goce
j'aurais pas pens? que je les aimerais
Les copains m'ont suivi sur un bout d'chemin
Quand on est arriv? sur le quai je crois
La premi??re fois qu'on se serrait la main
Dans les r??ves que je faisais
Ca commen?ait bien comme
Ca commen?ait comme ?a
J'ai tourn? longtemps tout autour de la terre
Dans un sens et puis l'autre et m??me ? l'envers
j'ai vu de l'or et les marchands de passes
J'ai appris des mots dans des langues sucr?es
Je les recitais pour ne pas les oublier
C'?tait sans compter que je me mentais
Dans les r??ves que je faisais
Ca se passait bien comme ?a
Ca s'passait bien comme ?a
Tous les souvenirs du monde je les donne
Je les echange aux passants pour avoir su regarder
Pour avoir su me garder
Une petite gosse, une poup?e
A tenir dans mes bras
On reveint toujours pour refermer les yeux
Pour me faire rentrer faut dire y avait pas mieux
J'avais pas pens? que je les aimais
A rester, au comptoir comme dans un bocal
A m'imaginer en les regardant passer
Le samedi soir, leurs chignons d?faits
Dans les r??ves que j'ai pu faire
Ca finissait pas comme ?a

Le Train 
C'tait pas seulement pour voir la mer
Que j'tais l, rendez vous au quai
J'avais dans l'sac, et j'avais pas l'air
Un petit refrain qui s'tait roul dans le bruit
Oh je te donnerai mes nuits
Et la chaleur de mes deux seins
Je te donnerai mes folies
Comprends moi bien ce n'est pas rien
Ne m'attend pas en vainqueur
Je ne veux pas d'un dompteur
Je ne veux pas d'un seigneur
Ca disait a aussi
C'tait pas seulement pour voir la mer
Que j'ai pris le train au milieu de l'hiver
J'avais pens que t'allais me trouver
Pour mon petit refrain mieux que le bruit du train qui repart
J'allais te donner mes matins
Mes jours de fte et mes chagrins
Fidlit de mes deux mains
Comprends moi bien ce n'tait pas rien
Si le train s'emballe, on s'excite un peu
Chaque fois que l'on aime on meurt un petit peu
Dans le hall de gare les gens qui s'etalent
Jusqu'au prochain dpart ...
Je reprends mon train  l'envers
Snas avoir regard la mer
Sans dballer tous les secrets
Rangs au fond de mes paquets
j'ai le grondement des machines
Et le son du coup de sifflet
Comprends moi bien, oh ce n'tait pas rien ...

Bouffaient nos fils le jour de leurs 15 ans

Sortis de nos draps

Les rues du village s'allumaient d'un coup
A six heures moins le quart
Les portes ouvertes de la grande usine
Bouffaient nos fils bien avant leurs 15 ans
On se lve trop tt
On sait plus quoi faire
Dans le caf des vieux
Les mains dans nos poches
Cachent nos poings noirs

10 things I hate about you poem
I hate the way you talk to me, 
and the way you cut your hair.
I hate the way you drive my car, 
I hate it when you stare. 
I hate your big dumb combat boots 
and the way you read my mind. 
I hate you so much it makes me sick,
it even makes me rhyme. 
I hate the way you're always right, 
I hate it when you lie. 
I hate it when you make me laugh,
even worse when you make me cry. 
I hate it when you're not around, 
and the fact that you didn't call. 
But mostly I hate the way I don't hate you, 
not even close
not even a little bit 
not even at all.

Cruel To Be Kind 
Oh I can't take another heartache
Though you say you're my friend
I'm at my wits end
You say your love is bonafide
But that don't coincide
With the things that you do 
And when I ask you to be nice
You say you gotta be
Cruel to be kind, in the right measure
Cruel to be kind, it's a very good sign
Cruel to be kind, means that I love you
Baby, you gotta be cruel to be kind
Well I do my best to understand dear
But you still mystify, and I wanna know why
I pick myself up off the ground
To have you knock me back down
Again and again
And when I ask you to explain
You say you gotta be
Cruel to be kind, in the right measure
Cruel to be kind, it's a very good sign
Cruel to be kind, means that I love you
Baby, you gotta be cruel to be kind
Well I do my best to understand dear
But you still mystify, and I wanna know why

To have you knock me back down
Again and again
And when I ask you to explain

Even Angles Fall 
You've found hope
You've found faith,
Found how fast she could take it away.
Found true love,
Lost your heart.
Now you don't know who you are.
She made it easy,
Made it free,
Made you hurt til you couldn't see.
Sometimes it stops,
Sometimes it flows,
But baby that is how love goes.
You will fly and you will crawl;
God knows even angels fall.
No such thing as you lost it all.
God knows even angels fall.
It's a secret no one tells;
One day it's heaven, one day it's hell.
It's no fairy tale;
Take it from me,
That's the way it's supposed to be.
You will fly and you will crawl;
God knows even angels fall.
No such thing as you lost it all.
God knows even angels fall.
You laugh, you cry, no one knows why
Behold the thrill of it all...
You're on the ride
You might as well
Open your eyes
You will fly and you will crawl;
God knows even angels fall.
No such thing as you lost it all.

One Week 
It's been one week since you looked at me,
cocked your head to the side and said: "I'm angry!"
Five days since you laughed at me, saying:
"Get that together, come back and see me."
Three days since the living room.
I realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you.
Yesterday you'd forgiven me,
but it'll still be two days 'till I say I'm sorry.
Hold it now and watch the hoodwink,
as I make you stop think.
You'll think you're looking at Aquaman.
I summon fish to the dish, although I like the Chalet Swiss.
I like the sushi, 'cause it's never touched a frying pan.
Hot like wasabe when I bust rhymes.
Big like LeAnn Rimes, because I'm all about value.
Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits.
You try to match wits.
You try to hold me, but I bust through.
Gonna make a break and take a fake.
I'd like a stinkin' achin' shake.
I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavours.
Gotta see the show, 'cause then you'll know
the vertigo is gonna growm 'cause it's so dangerous
you'll have to sign a waiver.
How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad?
Trying hard not to smile though I feel bad.
I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral.
Can't understand what I mean? Well, you soon will.
I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve.
I have a history of taking off my shirt.
It's been one week since you looked at me,
threw your arms in the air and said: "You're crazy!"
Five days since you tackled me.
I've still got the rug burns on both my knees.
It's been three days since the afternoon.
You realized it's not my fault, not a moment too soon.
Yesterday you'd forgiven me and now I sit back
and wait 'till you say you're sorry.

like Sting I'm tantric, like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy.
Like Kurasawa I make mad films.
Okay, I don't make films, but if I did they'd have a Samurai.
Gonna get a set a' better clubs.
Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs.
Just so my irons aren't always flying off the back-swing.
Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon,
'cause the cartoon has got the boom anime babes
who make me think the wrong thing.

dropped your arms to your sides and said: "I'm sorry!"
Five days since I laughed at you and said:
"You just did just what I thought you were gonna do!"
Three days since the living room.
We realized we're both to blame, but what could we do?
Yesterday you just smiled at me 'cause it'll still be
two days 'till we say we're sorry.
It'll still be two days 'till we say we're sorry...
It'll still be two days 'till we say we're sorry...

Outside,
All around me,
Really sleazy,
Then it hits me
Don't tell me,
You can see,
What It means to me,
Leave me
Don't tell me,
You can see,
What it means to me,
Leave me be

10 Things I Hate About You
The Weakness In Me ( Joan Armatrading ) 
I'm not the sort of person who falls in and quickly out of love
But to you I gave my affection right from the start
I have a lover who loves me, how could I break such a heart
Yet still you get my attention
Why do you come here when you know I've got troubles enough
Why do you call me when you know I can't answer the phone
Make me lie and I don't want to
And make someone else some kind of unknowing fool
You make me stay when I should not
Are you so strong or is all the weakness in me
Why do you come here and pretend to be just passing by
But I mean to see you
And I mean to hold you, tightly
Feeling guilty, worried, waking from tormented sleep
This old love has me bound but the new love cuts deep
If I choose now, I'll lose out, one of you has to fall
And I need you, and you
Why do you come here when you know I've got troubles enough
Why do you call me when you know I can't answer the phone
Make me lie and I don't want to
And make someone else some kind of unknowing fool
You make me stay when I should not
Are you so strong or is all the weakness in me
Why do you come here and pretend to be just passing by
But I mean to see you
And I mean to hold you, tightly

10 Things I Hate About You
Your Winter 
The grey ceiling on the earth
Well it's lasted for a while
Take my thoughts for what they're worth
I've been acting like a child
Your opinion, what is that?
It's just a different point of view
What else, what else can I do?
I said I'm sorry, yeah, I'm sorry
I said I'm sorry, but what for?
If I hurt you then I hate myself
I don't want to hate myself,
don't want to hurt you
Why do you choose your pain if you only knew
How much I love you love you
Well I won't be your winter
And i won't be anyone's excuse to cry
And we can be forgiven
And I will be here
Old picture on the shelf
It's been there for a while
A frozen image of ourselves
We were acting like a child
Innocence and in a trance
A dance that lasted for a while
Read my eyes just like a diary
Oh remember, please remember
Well I'm not a begger, but whats more
If I hurt you then I hate myself
I dont want to hate myself, dont want to hurt you
Why do you choose that pain if you only knew
How much I love you, nooo
Well I won't be your winter
And I won't be anyone's excuse to cry
We can be forgiven
And I will be here ohh
No, I won't be your winter (i wont)
And I won't be anyone's excuse to cry
And we can be forgiven
And I will be here
I won't be your winter (i wont)
And i won't be anyone's excuse to cry
And we can be forgiven
And I will be here

Wait the fact you did it.
Don't admit it.
Won't make you innocent.
Fate finds you wicked.
Turns you victim for everything you have done.
So justify the reason to kill.
Reason to kill.
I bet you will.
Find no one but yourself.
But yourself.
I wish you well.
Oh what tangled webs we weave.
When we practice to deceive.
I know you well.

Bare the cross, wear the crown, it's just some evil you can't bleed out.
Our actions and motives.

Bare the cross, wear the crown, it's just some evil you can't bleed out.
I just don't get it.
How you managed to justify who dies.
Like judge and jury.
Your the very one who crucifies.
Don't get your hands dirty to kill.
Use someone else.
Know all your lies are measured in hell.
I wish you well.
Oh what tangled webs we weave.
When we practice to deceive.
I know you well.
I know you well.
Actions and motives.
Bare the cross, wear the crown, it's just some evil you can't bleed out.
Our actions and motives.

Bare the cross, wear the crown, it's just some evil you can't bleed out.
Can't bleed out!

Well water thicker than blood.

Your failure to find compromise.

You play the part of the fool so well.

All Your Lies 
Pay attention, pay attention, pay attention please.
He who lusts through life for excess in this world.
Dies a lonely man, careless of his soul.
Throwing caution to the wind with foolish ignorance.
You're full of pride.
Full of pride.
Full of pride.
And in arrogance you can't accept the nearing end of this short lived life.
Smile and give a toast, brag and boast.
Fool the world with all of your lies.
The parasite's host never even knows.
Pull the wool over our eyes.
Walk the line and pay the price.
A pound of flesh for paradise.
Wear the wounds of your demise.
Fail to mention your intentions, fail to mention why.
The actions of your life contradict your words...
The path in which you walk is a vice of no remorse.
Washing conscience from the skin, claiming innocence.
Ignore the signs.
Smile and give a toast, brag and boast.
Fool the world with all of your lies.
The parasite's host never even knows.
Pull the wool over our eyes.
Walk the line and pay the price.
A pound of flesh for paradise.
Wear the wounds of your demise.
A pound of flesh for paradise.
Bend the truth till you can't find it.
Find it.
Twist your lies till you don't mind them.
Mind them.
Walk the line and pay the price.
A pound of flesh for paradise.
Wear the wounds of your demise.
Demise.
From cradle to grave, you chose to trade.

Vanities of business built to please the unique
Silicon and stars collide; the rest will fall at night

Your insecurities are concealed by your pride
Pretty soon your eager will kill what's left inside

Casted out I'm watching your eyes
Casting out my visions of nine
Blacking out
Casted out I'm watching your eyes bleed dry
Touch with frustrated lips
Love is like starting over
With every step engraving the problems of memories
Casted out I'm watching your eyes
Casting out my visions of nine
Blacking out
Casted out I'm watching your eyes bleed dry
Drunks on failures regrets
Letters of silence confess burdens within
Speaking as loneliness listens
While hopelessly feeling
Casted out I'm watching your eyes
Casting out my visions of nine
Blacking out
Casted out I'm watching your eyes bleed dry
There's a definite pattern to our behavior
Somehow the end draws us closer
Casting out my visions of nine
Casted out let ten die with time

Casted out I'm watching your eyes run dry

I can't seem to change you or open up your eye's 
So go on and sing your sad, sad song.
I don't even blame you the routine is nice.
Nine to five and a suit and tie.
Fear of failure a comfort zone is killed.
Braise your self's and give into the moment.
I've got nothing to lose.
So what is your excuse?
Save yourself's your dying in slow motion.
You got nothing to lose.
So what's your excuse?
Life can't seem to teach you the safe caught is right.
So stray from the fight.
Don't you realize?
The daydreamers nightmare is to never even try.
You kind of slipped by.
Fear of failure a comfort zone is killed.
Braise your self's and give into the moment.
I've got nothing to lose.
So what is your excuse?
Save yourself's your dying in slow motion.
You got nothing to lose.

Take a step back and find a way out of here.

Dying Youth 
Deep under the surface I keep the love.
Older and aware of a hidden universe.
I've prayed to be young, and prayed to be inspired.
The words of your tongue blister like fire.
I can't let you go.
Slow down, don't leave.
Dying days of my youth, overtake me.
There is a glimpse of death in your eyes.
I'm not prepared to let out those cries.
I plead to stay young soon, but soon will be expired.
So lost in denial.
I can't let you go.
Slow down, don't leave.
Dying days of my youth, overtake me.
Breach in her womb, sheltered from strife.
Bearing the gifts, and burdens of life.
I've prayed to stay young, but soon will be expired.
An age of innocence, long since gone.
I can't let you go.
Slow down, don't leave.
Dying days of my youth, overtake me.
Those who are looking backwards, chose to live as statues.
Frozen, fractured, youthful laughter, fades.
I can't let you go.
Slow down, don't leave.
Dying days of my youth, overtake me.
I can't let you go.
Slow down, don't leave.
Dying days of my youth, overtake me.

Styling your shroud
Infecting the crowd
Steady letting the fruit of her thrill
Fool you so well
Fictitious styles of living
We've expected to work
But this is all your giving
Half of what your worth
Pigeon hold in battles
Overtones of snow in her clutch
Falling through lines
One more breath destroys the best of you
The death of you
Styling your shroud
Infecting the crowd
Steady letting the fruit of her thrill
Fool you so well
A precious gift embedded deep within your skin
But parasitic pleasures are closer than kin
Please expose your shadows
Such concerns are products of love
Falling in lies
One more fraud destroys our trust in you
Our love for you
Styling your shroud
Infecting the crowd
Steady letting the fruit of her thrill
Fool you so well
As you kiss the abstract
And pray it's everything you'd hoped for
The smell of her, the thrill of her
The fruit of her, the use of her
Is killing everything that you've worked for

Tension made of razors
Dragging across you
The flushing of eyes
Couldn't cleanse your abrasions
Deep inside consumed with guilt

Dream suspicious strangers over night

Silent movements mar reinjuring God

Briding a widow in spite of her venom

Three becoming two
Such a left in criminal
Only the mind of the temptress knows
Actions are my remorse for amnesia

Autumn swiftly stole the breath of body, mind and soul
Try and come to willingly embrace
Kharma's kiss of withering decay
Death feeds, Hell breeds
Subside in the Autumn
Autumn indicates the death of beauty as we know
Autumn indicates the death of beauty as we know
Keep on fighting one died from burning at his throat
Autumn swiftly stole the breath of body, mind and-
Silent beauty 
No one cares
Silent ending
No one is there

The Recipe 
Lives swallow the infatuation
Cleverly seduced
Evil's in the stink of you
Rise and fall we decompose
Rest against the sore
Push breath and pull
Ripping out compassion
Instincts adapting
Sin sings a moan
In slides night
Unite and spread the heart apart
And smile of pain
I can't show my true embrace
Now that you're subdued
I begin to weaken you
Rise and fall we decompose
Prey on the masses
Conscience relapses
The less we think and
more we drink our actions are casual
While sin sings a moan
Lives swallow the infatuation
Cleverly seduced
Evil's in the stink of you
Rise and fall
We decompose
Distance is safer than trust
Honestly honesty's a fable in love
Calloused
Shedding skin I start to grin as malice
Becomes my fuel
I can't show my true embrace
Now that you're subdued
I begin to weaken you
Rise and fall we decompose
Shedding skin I start to grin as malice
Becomes my fuel

Through The Iris 
Cherish
Two circular views of blue with a gray shade
So captivating
More than you know
False preceptions
That brought forth these questions of
Truth, love and hope
Now that you're injuring
I carry you with me just
Please hold on
Disappear and dissolve
A weakening wall
Will one day fall
It's wise to sever our loss
I redefine pulse
Through your iris
Love's not all lost
But it's nailed to my cross
And crucified all that I've held on
To be awaiting
Anticipating a touch such as yours
False affection
A spawn of neglecting
A love, lust, hoax
Please understand me
That now where you're standing
Is closer then I'd hoped
Disappear and dissolve
A weakening wall
Will one day fall
It's wise to sever our loss
I redefine pulse
Through your iris
Your Iris
Your Iris
Disappear and dissolve
A weakening wall
Will one day fall
It's wise to sever our loss
I redefine pulse
Through your iris
Disappear and dissolve

Will one day fall
It's wise to sever our loss
I redefine pulse

Waking Up 
Distance and space allow emotions to age into faith
Our bodies may end up alone but close
Are you there can you hear me
Are you there can you feel me
Just in the way all your fingertips touch me
They are healing
One day we'll all fall prey
Are you there can you hear me
Are you there can you feel me
Waking up good morning to you my dear
I'm waking up enduring my biggest fears of
Distance away (a weight) distance away
Are you there can you hear me
Are you there can you feel me
Waking up good morning to you my dear
I'm waking up enduring my biggest fear love

Change my attempt good intentions
Crouched over
You were not there 
Living in fear
But signs were not really that scarce 
Obvious tears
But I will not 
Hide you through this 
I want you to help them
And please see 
The bleeding heart perched on my shirt 
Die, withdraw 
Hide in cold sweat
Quivering lips 
Ignore remorse
Naming a kid, living wasteland 
This time you've tried 
All that you can turning you red
Change my attempt good intentions 
Should I, could I 
Here we are with your obsession
Should I, could I
Crowned hopeless
The article read living wasteland
This time you've tried 
All that you can turning you red

Hide you through this 
I want you to help
Change my attempt good intentions 
Should I, could I 
Here we are with your obsession
Should I, could I
Heave the silver hollow sliver 
Piercing through another victim 
Turn and tremble be judgmental 
Ignorant to all the symbols
Blind the face with beauty paste 
Eventually you'll one day know 
Change my attempt good intentions 
Limbs tied, skin tight
Self inflicted his perdition
Should I, could I
Change my attempt good intentions
Should I, could I
Should I, could I

Back Lash 
Mesmorized by your beauty i feel powerless in your gaze
Ostracized, treated unfairly at night i dream of blood filled days
Because in this world
No one has your back
A lifetime of devotion
All i feel is had
What's the price of freedom what's the price of integrity
Should i suffer for your sins and live this life of agony
Because in this world
A lifetime is devotion
And all i feel is had
A generation of apathy with folk heros from infamy
Empty lives now have direction
Just one bullet changed perception
Kicked and beaten for so long pushed around
And told i'm wrong
With you in my sights i'm free no longer fear
But strength you see

Destiny Never Came 
I wasn't meant to be, no one sent for me.
Always told I was something more.
This destiny will destroy me.
Been rotting to the core.
Never once did I care of the plans that were made.
Never once did I cry at the end, or at my grave.
They pushed and pushed till I would bleed.
Not even once did I agree to all the shit they fed me.
Could never make a man succeed.
And I screamed, and I did shout.
They chewed me up and spit me out.
But here I stand with broken hands.
Pounding on the walls of fucking destiny.
Fuck your destiny.
Fuck your golden child.
Fuck your women and children.
Fuck you and die.
Fuck your plans for me.
Oh can't you see I never wanted a part of this shit that you have planned for me.
Destiny never came.

Dying In My Own Arms 
What makes you think that your death is secure?
That you won't die alone.
Your solace isn't something to seek.
It's a sign of the weak.
Who will save your rotten soul?
In time all memories will fold.
Ace down with your head in your hands.
You'll be dying in your own arms.
BROKE DOWN!!!
Left a wreck.
BURNT OUT!!!
A husk of a man.
WASTED!!!
But not nearly so close.
I'm dying in my own arms.
Do you think you have someone?
You will die alone.
Die alone motherfucker.

Hard Luck 
The classic struggle of good and evil
Has brought me to my knees
My mind is so filled with hate
One hundred demons possessing me
Your kind never inspired me
You never offered your hand
Just told me who i should be
But you don't know who i am
You say i dwell on the negative
Well it's a part of my life
Until you've tasted how i live
Keep your fucking advice to yourself
All that time you wasted
Preaching to the converted
A lifetime of hard luck
Still can't make me give up
Time has conquered youth
But the angers still inside
It doesn't come from hate
It's from a sense of pride

Way too fucking slow
You never see my weakness
I never let it show
Buried so deep inside me
I can't remember where
On my way straight to hell
And i'll wait for you there
Where can i find the answers
I've looked everywhere
Drugs, religion, sin and penance
I've tried them all they're not the cure
I've been beaten down by life
But i'me still fighting abck
I want to die with dignity
Keep your tears i'm on track
Destined to go nowhere
Determined to get there first
Where can i find the answers
I've looked everywhere
Drugs, religion, sin and penace
I've tried them all they're not the cure

His father's son is now a man.
Before he stands a stranger in his eyes.
Through his life he never lent a hand.
Where does he stand in his only sons mind?
Where were you when we needed you the most?
You disappeared you coward.
Hide your head in shame.
You did no wrong?
You tried your best?
WELL YOU LIE!!!
You destroyed all she had ever worked for.
What have you done?
Look what you made.
Thanks for the pain I will take to the grave.
You must know but this time I never needed
You, must must know through the years I never needed
You, can see from my face I never needed...
How does it feel to have your honor shamed?
I know the feeling well.
I've felt the pain.
Another life you let your seed and died.
Now you're gone, never to return.
I see the way you hold the children these days.
No ties to them - the ease throw your past away.
I won't forget these scars you planted in my mind.
You will never hold my first-born.

How Can I Forget 
I guess it's been a year or two or three
I let myself forget who i'm supposed to be
Lived for myself no matter what was said or done
Didn't give a fuck if i offended everyone
Another day still living in the gutter
I never doubt i'm better than the others
My actions prove me wrong every fucking day
Just watch me contradict every word i say
I can't kick these drugs they're still kicking me
If i could leave it behind who the fuck would i be
Defined myself for years by the rules i broke
Another drink and i'll forget
If i can't remember how can i regret
Another pill and i'll forget
If i can't remember how can i regret
Another bundle and i'll forget

Cuz in this world of pain
Nothing breaks the memory of your touch
What was i thinking
I should have kept drinking
To flood you face from my mind
But now it's over and i'm sober enough
To know you fucked my mind
Love can seem like slow death
If it's not returned
You will feel your body and soul
Start to burn with desire
And unrelenting pain
The tears they cloud my eyes
I bite my tongue till i taste my blood
So you won't hear my cries
Hiding in my private darkness
I put you out of my mind
My fear of death being overcome
By my hatred for this life

In the place of gods, in the hands of fate.
I gave it all but I've been raped.
No friends ever came, no love for me.
I know that I'm free.
From the words, from the cancer, from their eyes.
From all the bullshit I despise.
From all the countless fucking lies.
You're all dead to me.
If I could I would stop your heart.
Not a threat, just a thought I do enjoy.
Do your best to keep me from you.
My broken dreams and shattered goals.
Stop the lies, we are not friends.
End of the line for your forked tongue.
Since I was young nothings more true.
Than what was told that golden clue.
She always said "Our blood ran deep."
And no one can compete...with the ties that you have with family.
Your trust should weigh so heavily on the ones who raised and cared for you.

Don't think it's a call, a plea for help.
I never asked anyone.
From what I've seen, from the look of things I can only help myself.
I had faith that I was loved by you.
But it has filtered through.
Seeping through my hands.

Left with no more than a glimpse of what you have become.

I'm already dead i just don't know it yet
Because you stole my heart a love i can't forget
Slowly dying when will i go
I wish i was dead i feel so alone

The pain it burns inside i suffer everyday
Still alive wishing i was dead like christ at the stake

I should have seen it loud and clear

just leave it all alone

something hangs out in the yard

I turned to look but found you gone
I can't believe what you have done
I watched the tears run down your face

What kind price will you now pay to make the nightmares go away
they follow you into the calm, there's no escape, something's wrong

Chameleon Song (Disappear) 
To be deceived in silence
by a loneliness shared with a heart gone wrong
it grows, speaking words made of stone
beneath them chameleons squirm
I thought you'd send your kiss to rescue me
now I can't even decide in what to believe
I hope you find him, I hope he's real
I hope you find him...before your love disappears
to seek an act of kindness
underneath the mask and the disguises worn
they burn like memories lost
lighting a path to her heart
I hope you're happy, I hope you heal
I hope you wake up...before your love disappears
to see the dreams inside her
slowly turning to rust
after another day
she sings, but her words have become
a tragic chameleon song

Somebody's Been Sleeping 
Fe Fi Fo Fum
I can feel the presence of someone
Somebody's been sleeping in my bed
Somebody's been sitting in my chair
They ate up all my food
And I don't stand to search
Don't ell me it was a woman
Cause a woman don't eat that much
My brand new silk pajama's
They're rolled up in the chair
My mind ain't playing tricks on me
Now tell me is he still here
Somebody's been sleeping in my bed
Somebody's been sitting in my chair
Cigarettes in my ashtray
And I don't even smoke
Somebody's been in my best booze
I can tell cause the seal is broke
I left my bedroom slippers
Last night underneath of my bed
And now they're in my living room
And my bed was left unmade
Somebody's been sleeping in my bed
Somebody's been sitting in my chair
Fe Fi Fo Fum
I can feel the presence of someone
Fe Fi Fo Fum
I can feel the presence of someone
Somebody's been sleeping in my bed
Somebody's been eating my food
Somebody's been looking at my shoes
Somebody's been sitting in my chair
Somebody's been sleeping in my bed...

Dreams 
only now do you realize
as the tears pour from your eyes
whatever is left can never replace
whatever is lost whatever the price
don't regret the choices that you made
it's too late now
it's too late now
when all that's left is an empty shell
you start to think, you start to dream
embrace all you have known
be it truth or lies
let the truth stand alone
now you fell and steal kisses
what drives bringing blade to wrist

Hello, Moderater 
Look at yourself.
Sitting there, at your
Computer, reading this.
What kind of pathetic
Life are you
Leading, huh?
I mean, look at yourself.
How did you even land
This job? It must be your
Great circle of connections.
Or, dear God, it may be
That your the loser
Who created/designed
This whole derned site
And in which case,
I salute you man, cause you have
Bigger balls than me to actually
boast that on the Internet.
However, i am probably
Mistaken, and you actually
Like what you
Do for a living.
In any case, I just
Thought that you should
Know how pathetic your
Life has become.
P.S.
If youre looking for where you'll
be in five years,
look in the mirror and smile.
No, wiat, frown.

Read This (Everyone) 
I have a sick mind
And usually I would put 
Something completely 
Random here
As I did on the other
Song by "What Made
Miliwauke Famous" (check
it out, i think its good
lyrics writing seeing
as how its on the
spot)
But other than
That, im just writing
This becuase I know
You're probably smiling right
Now.  From person
To person it may vary
Why you are smiling,
But for
The most part its because
You are amazed that
Someone that
You have never met before
Is just
Writing in such a 
Personal way on some
Website in some crappy
Artists lyrics.
By the way, Ive never heard 
Of this
Band, or the Miliwauke
One either.  But i doubt this
Will even make it past
The verifiers of this site.
Goodbye.

I'll Hide
Away from the Sun
Inside
As Christ Burns
You are blinded by your bloodshot eyes
You are deafend by the screams of lost hope

How can you live like this
As the people around you fall to the ground
You close your eyes and close your mind there's nothing left to know.

The Beauty Of Blood 
tears shatter as they fall
1000 crystals to split the light
the beauty of the rainbow
to mask the blood that stains the ground
vision blurs and the ground shakes
children cry in their mother's arms
a flower can't drink from parched land
they ddrink the blood that stains the ground
the beauty of blood is in us all
the beauty of blood eats away at my soul
i've watched you die a thousand times
a thousand more and it still would be beautiful
you're beautiful to me

this can't be happening
please take me away

put me on display
when will this blood stained curtain be pulled
our blind eyes don't see the signs
young minds build on me mechanical design
will the hate stop in time
or do we just live to die
you are controlled by what you can't see
it makes life nothing
nothing but a show
built to burn

when will this blood stained curtain be pulled

Can We Talk 
last night I 
I saw you standing
and i started,started pretending
I knew you and you knew me too
And just like a roni
You were too shy
But you weren't the only'cause so was I
And i've dreamed of you ever since
Now i've built up my confidence
Girl next, next time you come my way
I'll know just what to say
(Can we talk for a minute
Girl i want to know your name
Can we talk for a minute
Girl i want to know your name)
I started to write you letters
But i wanted to be more clever 
I wanted to get down and sweet talk to you
But just like a baby 
I could not talk
I tried to come closer
But could not walk 
And i think of it every night
How i just could not get it right 
If we ever come close again
I know what i'll say then 
(HOOK) 
Oh girl, one more chance 
With you again 
I will not let it go 
Oh please, give me just one more chance for love (HOOK)

Kitty Kat Max 
Kitty Kitty, kitty kitty cat
Kitty Kitty, kitty kitty cat
Well my kitty cat ran I was so sad inside
The feelings that I have I can no longer hide
I want him back as fast as I can
He's my little buddy and Im his friend
Without my little kitty I don't know what to do
I'm felling sad and blue
He has a little red nose and a fuzzy head
A soft couch to sleep on, he's quite well fed
Instead I will brush and pet him all the time
I think he really likes it cause he gives the sign,
A little nudge of his nose and a sandpaper lick,
Sticks his claws in my back and I scream aww shit 
But he doesn't mean to hurt I m gonna be real kind
Without my little kitty think I'm loosin my mind
I'm bribin other cats to search for Max, 
I Said, I'm bribin other cats to search for Max
I'm offerin things that they cant refuse
Like Purina cat chow and some soft beef chews
A little mousy and a ball of catnip
A bowl of cream and some tuna-fish dip
I think its kind of working cus they're searching around
Max is a homie and he must be found
I leave the windows open, I hope that he'll jump in
I've gotta see him soon, hes such a cute little thing
So if you're out there Max and you hear this song
Hey, little buddy, will ya please come home?
I called my man Bret to explain my situation
He said grab a pen and paper, start a new creation
Radio stations all across the nation will be down no doubt with your unique situation
I remember the days when I would go to bed
Wake up in the morning with Max on my head, my face so full of hair I'd want ta scream and holler
Unable because my mouth's full of flea collar
But, that's the fact, hes gone and Im blue
I wrote this little song, think it's the right thing to do
So, little girl if you can find my kitty 
Will you please bring him back to my part of the city
If you bring him back soon you get a sweet surprise
I'll kiss you right on the mouth and take a swim in your eyes
I think it's a fair fee so I hope youre down
My address is (something) P. O. Box a thousand clowns

Not The Greatest Rapper 
I wanna be down, yo, will you let me?
I get real close, I kiss her face real gently.
Don't sweat me girl youre everything I ever needed
And when I'm with you my heart starts to bleed
I plead and plead and plead and plead for a litle kiss
And if you say "okay" I just got my wish
On the town the night will be just right
I hold your hand but I wont squeeze too tight.
I feed you food that you've never eaten
I think about it and my heart starts beating
I look at you and it nearly wrecks me
I never met a girl who was so damn sexy!
A week later and some daisies after, 
You get a postcard from this silly rapper
And it says I'll be knocking on your front door,
Cuz I've never loved a girl like this before!
I know I'm not the greatest rapper in the world
But would ya, would ya, would ya please be my girl?
I know I'm not the greatest rapper in the world
But would ya, would ya, would ya please be my girl?
I know I'm not the greatest rapper in the world
But please baby, please baby be my girl.
I know I'm not the greatest rapper in this land
But I'll do anything if you'll hold my hand.
I pick her up and its raining heavy

Hear the shots pulling out all the stops 
While collecting mad props gotta ride it like a Caddy 
While your girl calls me daddy gonna party with Bacardi 
Gettin' loose you know we're naughty 
Pass the forty and the blunt I'm not a stuntman 
Look into my eyes and realize I am the one who can flow 
You know these waves as deep as the ocean 
And my cuts with unified were baptised in commotion 
Got this potion called game jumpin' out of my pores 
And if the mind is a weapon then my rhyme is a sword 
So all aboard the soul train these dice that I roll 
Man are comin' up kid I'm the one they call No-Name 
You can't see me in the shadows 
And when it comes to battle I'm Cadillac backed 9,999 prime time 
When we rhyme five dollar dime on the mind 
Make you stop look and listen and you'll still be missing mine 
I'm rollin' with the crown on my hood 
Good wood with a Louisville Slugger motherfucker 
Fuck around say hey batter batter watch a motherfucker splatter 
When I hear your teeth chatter makes this motherfucker madder 
Nigga got more game than Chutes and Ladders 
Had enough so ruff so tuff get your hands against the wall 
I'll call your motherfuckin' bluff now puff some herb 
You look disturbed left you layin' in the curb 
Nigga lost in my verb victimized by my word 
If you bring this you better mean this 
I drop genius at my convenience and your nigga never saw me 
So I know you'll never see this creepers 
Peeps in my click deep in this shit since the day we were born 
And we'll bounce if you trip not down with a stick 
Automatic got a crown on the horn

Got dropped had to say later to the traitors 
Cause that shit had to stop Cleveland's my spot 
Props and peeps beats bump in Jeeps jump in clubs

Love baby be my Caddy I'll call you Daddy Cadillac Daddy

Booya rest in peace it was nice when I knew ya 
Strictly business don't let it fool ya closed casket

Leggo my Eggo like Prego 
We're in there like Energizer goin' goin' gone so long 
Down with U.C. so forth and so on 
I want it want it want it does that mean I can't have it 
Pull a rhyme out of my mind like pulling that rabbit out of a hat 
Ain't that kind of strange the vocal line rearranged 
But the beat didn't change 
Order in the court cooperate for a quarter 
And you oughta realize we ride and bring disorder transporters crossing borders 
Life is short and getting shorter 
Sex and lies and camcorders order a whiskey and a water 
Raise a toast to Bone for bringing it home to the Erie shores 
See the world got shown where you're at

We're thuggin' but never thieving 
You were deceiving yourself when you thought we weren't

Exercise In True Love 
My heart broke for the last time last night 
When I saw her disappear into the moonlight chasing midnight 
As I sat paging through the newspaper reading about who's at war with who? 
Who's lying to who? who's beating who? 
I reached for my cup of coffee 
As black as the minds of men and the hearts of women 
And I felt an uncontrollable emptiness. 
I looked up and through the glass window 
Hazy with a blanket of industry 
When suddenly the most beautiful woman appeared 
Like a cherub familiar yet strange. 
I felt as if I knew her as well as my own secrets
Yet I knew nothing. 
I felt an urge to jump out of my seat and hold her 
Then I realized a beauty of this magnitude 
Need not be tarnished by the expectations of another 
Nor could she ever again be what she was to me 
At that very moment an ounce of faith 
For a soul drunk with apathy. 
It's strange how we instinctively 
Attempt to alter what we love 
Often spawning the antithesis of it's own incarnate. 
This masochistic ignorance defines our species 
And will ultimately lead to our demise. 
As for my love outside that window 
Untainted she walks alone. 
I hope you know 
I hope you know that I love you for 
Forever and when forever never comes 
You'll be in my arms together-together-forever-forever 
We are one 
We are one

You know it never lets up and if it gets you down 
Put on the crown now get your heads up 
I got my wing tips don't need a grip to collect my chips 
Forty sip equipped not to trip as I pimp the apocalypse off the rip 
And on the rise see through the messiahs lies 
Got to silence all the cries the destruction and the demise 
We try to make it better make some cheddar make some cheese 
Coming correct we respect T-H-U-G's 
And these are the warriors and poets with a prophecy 
And I love that Bizzy Bone when he says 
That nobody can stop me who shot me

But they don't mean as much as the streets do 
You know what I mean? 
Step up step up and speak your mind

Raise your forty if you're naughty 
If you feel me join my army 
Gotta bomb 'em with this track 
It's trauma that we pack 
Mad drama Cadillacs got that karma coming back 
So avenge the souls cause it's revenge that we hold in the highest regard 
We praise the gods of old so let go of my style 
You stole three cards and you fold 
Motherfucker don't you know Cadillacs broke the mold 
Hands up it's a hold up you never should of showed up 
Cadillacs plot and rock the block 
Until it blows up back to the top drop 
Game plan can't you tell we're gettin' tired of the same old thing 
Man check it out we're coming up for a take down 
And ol boy is 'bout to buckle under breakdown 
Stand up if you're down take a look to the future 
This generation gap can't be sewn with a suture 
So step off the toes of those that you stand on 
Looks like you're fallin' off without a damn thing to land on 
History repeats itself society defeats itself 
And egos won't allow us to learn from our conceited self esteem 
Is what it is that we gotta take back if they hit ya

You betta keep your eyes on the sparrow 
Return of the dragon heir to the throne

Team is the key contradictory to belief 
Believe that team equals victory 
Now lock it in the pocket and let the rhythm roll

Across The Fields 
Well they left then in the morning, a hundred pairs 
of wings in the light moved together. In the colors 
of the morning I looked to the clouds in the cirrus sky and they'd gone. 
Across the marshes, across the fields below. 
I fell through the vines and I hoped they would catch me below. 
If only to take me with them there, 
tell me the part that shines in your heart on the wind. 
And the reeds blew me in the morning. 
Take me along to the places you've gone when my eyes looked away. 
Tell me the song that you sing in the trees in the dawning. 
Tell me the part that shines in your heart and the rays of love forever, 
please take me there.

All That Never Happens 
She walks alone on the brick lane, the breeze is blowing. 
A year had changed her forever, just like her grey home. 
He used to live so close here, we'd look for places I can't remember. 
The world was safe when she knew him, she tried to hold him, hold on forever. 
For all that never happens and all that never will be, 
a candle burning for the love we seldom keep. 
The earth was raw in her fingers, she overturned it. 
Considered planting some flowers, they wouldn't last long, 
no one to tend them. It's funny how these things go, 
you were the answer to all the questions. 
The memories made her weary, she shuddered slowly, she didn't want to. 
As a distant summer he began to whisper, and threw a smile her way. 
She looked into the glass, liquid surface showing that they were melding, 
together present past. 
So where can I go from here? 
The color fading, he didn't answer. 
She felt him slip from her vision. 
She tried to hold him, hold on forever. 
So close forever, in a silent frozen sleep.

You were looking away from me, western skies calling you. 
Colors spilling, running dazzling you. 
I was looking the other way, voices call from the east, 
I saw my roots of the trees there planted at my feet. 
It could be I'm searching for a place so small with room for everything 
where worlds on worlds revolve. 
But how can we wait? I wouldn't hold you back. 
Suppose I was the clever one and words came easy to me. 
I could say I was writing a song about you and me. 
Maybe that verse is yet to be found, but waits inside of me, 
a secret room a tangled web to unweave. 
But how can we wait knowing our ways, how can we hold on,

A big start running from me, I saw a world out sunning on my head. 
Turn the tables on me now. I would fall from heaven and ring your bell. 
Baby, catch me in the middle of a lie. 
The boys are out tonight, yeah the boys are out tonight. 
The big shots singin' from me, I saw a world out sunning on my head. 
Pity my heart signals: center of a storm inside my head. 
Center of my heart, center of my out of time simple mind. 
From the moon out my window a wink and a blink and a nod. 
Had a wish on a start but now it's falling. 
The boys are out tonight, big skies above me signal in my horoscope it said: 
never heed a caution, never fought a lover, 
never cross a street alone in the middle of a signal red, 
middle of a drinker's heart, middle of a big parade, a signal in my horoscope.

Young girl in my young girl days, thinking I could live for always.

Seasons pass like sand inside a glass and nothing, nothing returns. 
Standing with the friends I've made, I'll race them to the grave. 
Well who won, won the extra days?

Captured in his artist way before the memories fade away. 
To remember a face, and you're home or want to. 
Certain they would meet soon, paint a portrait of a family. 
Sigle light on, single way, single light away.

Green Children 
An August day in the hills of Spain, a pair of children emerged from a cave. 
The strangest sight there alone they stood, 
with skin of green and words no one had heard. 
The girl was stronger, the boy was weak, 
with her new mother she learned to speak. 
And wove a tale of a dying sun, they had left darkness, 
a dark world come undone. 
They travelled so far. Believing they came from a star. 
She fell through life, through time, through parallel lives. 
The men of science, the men of fame, the men of letters tried to explain: 
Was it parallel worlds or a twist of time to make her 
think she'd fallen from the sky? 
A whirlwind spun them all alone, took them from their twilight home. 
Believing they came from a star.

In The Quiet Morning 
In the quiet morning
There was much despair
And in the hours that followed 
No one could repair
That poor girl 
Tossed by the tides of misfortune
Barely here to tell her tale 
Rolled in on a sea of disaster 
Rolled out on a mainline rail 
She once walked tight at my side 
I'm sure she walked by you 
Her striding steps could not deny 
Torment from a child who knew 
That in the quiet morning
There would be despair 
And in the hours that followed
No one could repair 
That poor girl 
She cried out her song so loud
It was heard the whole world round
A symphony of violence

Love Among The Ruins 
The sky was falling, heaven was calling. 
When danger crashes, rose from the ashes. 
Like two statues hidden inside ancient rock, 
we were praying for the secrets to unlock. 
And when the sun had turned its back on us, 
in the dark our love kept track of us, pushed together by the lack of love. 
We held each other tightly through our hell of dreams. 
I still hear the never-endig echo of those screams. 
But it's a life not made for reliving, it's a life that makes your soul forgiving. 
We sealed our bond from the beginning. 
Aching, affection, vulnerable protection; falling, captured, crawling, rapture.

There was no way of knowing
Fallen leaves in the night 
Who can say where they're blowing 
As free as the wind 
And hopefully learning 
Why the sea on the tide
Has no way of turning 
More than this - there is nothing 
More than this - tell me one thing
More than this - there is nothing
It was fun for a while 
There was no way of knowing
Like a dream in the night 
Who can say where we're going 
No care in the world

Has no way of turning

Rainy Day 
On bended knee I've looked through every window then. 
Touched the bottom, the night a sleepless day instead; 
a day when love came, came easy like what's lost now found. 
Beneath a blinding light that would surround. 
We were without, in doubt, we were about saving for a rainy day. 
I crashed through floors of laughter, then. 
In a blind science, no ties would moor us to this room. 
A day when love came, came easy like what's lost now found. 
And you would save me, and I held you like you were my child.

In my darkest hour the only way to bring the dawn was your shining light.

Free me from my history and show me where to draw the line,

I'm not worried now about flying too close to the sun. 
When December skies are cold, you know I will always run to your shining light.

But how can they know it's time for them to go?
Before the winter fire, I will still be dreaming
I have no thought of time
For who knows where the time goes?
Who knows where the time goes?
Sad, deserted shore, your fickle friends are leaving
Ah, but then you know it's time for them to go
But I will still be here, I have no thought of leaving
I do not count the time
For who knows where the time goes?

And I am not alone while my love is near me

You Won't Find Me There 
I'd like to know what makes you stay while your eyes still search for escape.
You think that I don't feel the cold, but I wait while confessions unfold. 
You'll never make a living from reading minds 
or from getting your direction from exit signs. 
Look into your heart and you won't find me there.
You won't find me where you hide and that makes us a matter of time. 
Like trees exposed by fall, time reveals it all. 
Tell me you want to do everything but you're stuck up to your knees.
And I'm less likely pushed forward by ambition than a breeze. 
But there's a flame that must be fanned, and it appears as a beckoning hand. 
Don't think 'cause you're not talking you're being kind, 
you've been getting your direction from exit signs. 
Look into your heart and you won't find me there.

April Weather 
Keep that head held high 
And dont you let them see you fall
Mistakes are blessings in disguise
Smile when everything falls
And laugh when you start to cry
Know Im here to wipe your eyes
You think that youre the only one
Who feels this way
Well kid, youve got a lot to learn
Everyone falls down too, you just never see it
What I see in you
Youre as cute as your smile
And as sweet as the rain
Yea
Dont listen when they say
You wont amount to anything
Cause I believe in you
I think that youre so pretty 
And I think that youre nothing short from amazing
I think that youre so perfect
So perfect to me
Youre as cute as your smile 
And as sweet as the rain

A Real Boy 
Am I holding back feelings that I show. I guess Im just scared to tell you what I know. Girl youve got me wrapped all around your words. So please speak up now, man if you only knew herwhen you wish upon a star it makes no difference who you are. Anything your heart desires I will give to you. Is it just me or are you everything Ive dreamed?... I can read your eyes like a childhood book. And I become real and I know I should. Though my words are frail would you be mine tonight?

Breathe In 
So you take in everything you can
Just to make sure youre alright
And the voices from within
Begin to take flight
So you feel free, you feel everything
Just to feel alive
And youre dancing round and round
Just to feel this life
Now youre everything, everything right
But you dont feel alive
If your life is worth living, we all can try
To be alive
Amen
Time is of the essence, we cant learn to rhyme
But will millions of pages of all of lifes phrases, love, we can try
The voices around you, they claim to hold the truth, they cant save you
Just listen with eyes closed, feel what you know is life
Now I see the truth 
Its what binds me and you
And everyone swears that their real
Everyone swears they can feel
Well show me someone that loves this life

Brittany's Song 
-Verse 1-
Is this what you dreamed
That your life would always be
Torn up pages that never rhyme
Countless heartaches that always cry
-Chorus-
Do you want to come home
I know you try but you
Cant stand up strong
-Verse2-
I want you to know that 
I wont ever let you go
Try and try as you may
Ill be here every single day
-Bridge-
Youre an angel, Love, Ive told you that
So spread your wings and fly
Into the could where you belong
Now maybe the sun might shine

Carolee 
Ive seen the city, six times Im sure
Answered all the questions that you left on my door
Wrote all the answers on a Top Flight page
On the bed in my bedroom where I first thought you would soon amaze me
Well heres one question
For your diary filled with pages
What was the last thing I said?
Can you find the memory?
Or have you lost me
In pages beside your bed?
I find it strange that all you see
Is an open doorway, right before me and you walk on in
You said Please to meet you with that southern voice
So why cant I see that you leave me no choice?
Now listen dear
Speak words to me
Let me know that the place where youre at is halfway free
Cause here tonight
I fear youre lost

Dancing For Dreams 
Im not ashamed of
Anything that youve ever done
In fact I realize 
That its me youve been running from
The voices, the choices
Everything Ive done to keep you here
Is worthless, I know this
That letting go is your greatest fear
And you are safer
When I awake from my sleep
Im finally dancing for dreams
And now that you are free do 
Do you cry to sleep at night
I wont be there to wipe your eyes
To think I could stop time
Id do better to out shine the stars
Cause one day youll need me
But I wont be right there where you are
I wonder if its her
That keeps this fairy tale alive
Cause sometimes later at night
I feel the tear that comes from her eyes
I wont run away no I wont run away from you
Ill find a way, I will find a way to you

Go Down In A Fight 
Verse 1
Close your eyes, hold on tight
You're gonna make it
Rewind back to when you were young
Can you remember?
Trace back the innoncence that was lost
But can you find it?
-Chorus-
Go down swinging, go down in a fight
-Verse 2-
Tell me true, tell me that, that you love him
Honestly, does he let you understand
That you can make it
Just take my hand
-Repeat Chorus X3-
-Bridge-
And i'm not trying to write fairy tales
Cause girl you know their all lies
He says "you're great", that's wonderful
But can you see past his disguise...
-Verse 3-
You're an angel that's fallen from the stars
And they all want you...just look at your scars
-Chorus 2-
I swear you'll make, I swear you will
Give 'em hell kid, I'll be right there for you
It's alright, it'll be ok if you cry on my shoulder
Just let your tears fall on me
And realize, that all that glitters was never gold
It was your eyes
-Verse 4-
Now the crowd is wathin, watchin for you to fall
Give 'em hell kid, do it for us all
I told you once, i told you twice
Make a mistake and it'll cost a life...

Goodbye To New Orleans 
It almost kills me to realize that
I almost held you tight
You said New Orleans is where Im goin
And its just about time
Ill leave the faces, all the lonely places
Ill leave it all behind
I just shrug my shoulders, cause its gettin colder
In Mississippi tonight
No one understands what it feels like
To touch an angels hand
I hope your tears dont cry out the window
And dont look back, my love
They say everybody has somebody
They can grow old with
Well if thats true, then why is she leaving?
Why is she leaving rain clouds on my heart?
Im on my bed now, thinking about
You and everything I said
Dont leave me here
Dont say Goodbye
Cause youre in my heart
Where youll always stay
Where youll always stay, hey, hey
Come back to me
I am tired and I am broken
But Im willing to wait for you
Heres my last chance to let you know that
I love you and do you love me?
That summer was the greatest ever
I wished it never would have ended
When I looked at you and you looked at me
Just for once, Id like to know what it means to be free
You said New Orleans is where youre going
And its just about time
I never told you, but I will now
I think I love you

Her Wish 
-Verse 1-
She said I want someone to hold my hand
In the mall, just to make the other girls jealous
Someone to sing to me
And someone whos more romantic than goofy
Someone to throw stuffed animals at me
When Im acting dumb
And a guy who would make fun of me
Just to hear me laugh
-Chorus-
Well I cant buy you a diamond
Or a fancy life
But I could bet you all my kisses
Just to make you laugh
-Verse2-
She wants someone to play with her hair
And buy her a 25 cent ring
Someone who would share a lollipop
And count the stars just before it rains
Maybe someone who would fill their camera
Of pictures of her and their love
Someone who would always make her smile
That's someone she would love

My Greatest Fan(Jek Still Has It) 
-Verse 1-
Youre just above from amazing
Im a little short from anything
So would you take my hand
And lets run away
She likes the truth in any way
Even does dances when it rains
And she asked me Id like
To finish my life with her
-Chorus-
Well I would take you my friend
To a place far away
I know were in over our head
But you look so sweet, my greatest fan

Believe me, shes more than a song
She shines like Heaven when shes strong
Though lyrically, Im not a poet
And strangely Im ok
Cause you and I will outlive forever
Well give it a shot, someday

New York In The Winter 
You say dont worry, Ill be fine
Well the tears on your face tell me other wise
Its your unanswered questions that I cant explain
But Ill keep fighting for you
Instead of crying youd rather sing
Only the lighter notes of this symphony
So Ill protect you, I wont let you fall
And Ill keep fighting for you
So wont you take my hand tonight
And lets leave this town before it gets too late
Hey, I see city lights up ahead
New York has never been so bright
We were kids, what did we almost know?
That in the end wed follow through?
Your voice was strained from alcohol
Yet, I understood every word
You said hey boy, its not too late
For you to come and take me away
Matter of fact, Id rather leave right now
Cause Im tired of walking with the crowd
Its strange to see what youve become
When I think about leaving New York
Its a city of dreams that I always dreamed
That I could be a part of

Not Goin Back 
Tell me what you know and Ill spill my guts
About everything
Where were you when I felt like falling
Out in the rain?
Im not goin back
Again
Sometimes love I feel you with me
When its cold outside
You always loved the winter weather
You said itd never die
The leaves in the air matched the sky
I know because I was there
No one else could tell the wind
What it meant to you
Sometimes I wonder why
Why the snow fell down
It was questions wed figure out
Soon but not right now
I felt a pulling on my heart
But I told it to go
But it was you all along
You taught me what I know

Sing Me A Song 
Well maybe I try too hard for you
Yea, its just like me to do that
When common sense isnt the best choice
There needs to be one more voice
Day after day Im astounded
Of what you see in me
Beneath the skin-deep lies a hero
Waiting to come set you free
Here we are tonight
And it all seems right
From too many chances
How lost was I 
Fore you came in my life
I feel the best when we come alive
I stayed up late last night
Thinkin for once in my life
Are my words all but useless in time-consuming days?
Or do they just help me get by?
Everyone swears that Im crazy 
Well maybe Im crazy for you
When everything stays the same I change it
And Ill change it again
here it is shelby...haha. i heart you love!

Step Towards You 
When you come around
You make me feel so proud 
Isnt it common sense
When you feel like this
I would dance with you
Even if there was no song
We could get caught if we want
But playing games is just more fun
So I will
I will step towards you tonight
And I will
I will look into your eyes
Just to find out if theres life still left in this heart
Yea it beats but I just think that its not
Too many times have I failed to win
Just to prove I know where to begin
And you swear youre coming back around
She thinks that in the end
Shell become what shes not
And I cant help but laugh
Cause I know where she is and where Im at

Taylor's Song 
Hello dear friend I have been sitting here
Just bragging about your smile
And I have told many the memories that we shared
Its still hard to forget them
I smell your perfume when Im walking down the hall
I turn to hope its you
But I fail every time when I think that youre behind me
Cause youre always a step ahead
And I know its wrong but is it wrong to believe 
That theres still a chance for me
And I want to take your hand and make it mine once again
I still think youre the prettiest girl in the world
Signed me
In this crazy world theres only short romance
Lets make this last forever
Would you try to take back everything that you said
Cause it plays like a broken record in my head
Were better off friends, cause thats what well be in the end
Just friends?
O Nichole, you havent lost your touch, somehow Im still here
Just waiting for you
Now you just sit there lost in a stare
Please tell me one thing 
Have you forgotten that I was nothing till I saw your face
But now Im something, something youd be proud of
I feel some-what worth it and I know its cause of you

Thanks For A Good Time 
Im sorry for the day
That I saw your face
I tried to help myself, but I couldnt look away
Im sorry for the words
That I said to you
I couldnt help but tell you every word was true
I guess I got caught up
In what I thought could be
The greatest part of life, the greatest part of me
I wonder if you knew
What I was thinkin when 
You said to me that night Thanks for a good time
I guess I was just fooling myself
Cause how could I ever be with you
I guess my heart will rest here in last place
Its something Ive come used to
She cant help but feel
The lies that shes been told
Hell just run away, and youll grow only cold
I swear to you that I 
Will never leave your side
Ill always stand up tall

Theres no use fighting
Wed be denying what we know is true
Cause thats just what we do

The Love Of My Life 
Everyone has got something to show 
for me its this reflection 
promising itll find someone someday
and it seems like the whole world finally has sound 
telling me youre worth it 
and I think that youre worth it too my dear
So Ill stand back for now
and admire you from afar
cause no one else has ever made me feel this way 
and I wont hold your hand 
cause Ill never want to let go 
its a test of will that I am willing to take 
As priceless as the voice inside your eyes 
I give all I have to
show that I am still here 
and I dream about meeting you someday 
when I do I swear to you I will 
hold you tight and never let you go
So Ill stand back for now
and admire you from afar
cause no one else has ever made me feel this way 
and to the love of my life
heres my only prayer
that youll Christ more than you love this life
Cause thats where Ill find you
And I feel these chains finally broken
When I see your face staring right back at me
Its a chance that Ill take, yea I will
Just to show you that I really care
Girl I do, I swear that I care
And Ill stand back for now 
To admire you from afar
Just to show you that no one else has ever made me feel this way
And if you hold out your hand
Let it be to show me
That you were willing to wait till this day
To the love of my life
Youre my only prayer
Cause you loved Christ more than this life

When I See You(The Brandon Day Song) 
Theres no other way to say this
Love, Ive got to sing it
Gotta keep my head above the mountains
That Ive climbed to be with you
We were caught in something
I didnt let go
I told myself youd be back soon
I really hope I was right
Honestly, Im tired of commin in last place
Honestly, I honestly
Knew that I was wrong
Knew that I would fall
Knew that Id give everything I had
Just to see you smile
Tried to be perfect
Tried to let you let
Trying be as simple as the words
That come from my heart
You took me by surprise
When I first saw you
The sunlight in your hair
O, that long black hair in your face
I was nervous when you
Sat right down beside me
A firework display was nothing
Compared to your eyes that nite
Honestly, Im tired of commin in last place
Honestly, I honestly
Knew that I was wrong
Knew that I would fall
Knew that Id give everything I had
Just to see you smile
Tried to be perfect
Tried to let you let
Trying be as simple as the words
That come from my heart
And I would do it again
Just to relive those seconds
Even fireworks couldnt compare to you, my dear
Nor the stars that they shinned with
Its a memory
That I hope to see again
To see you smile one more time
To see your face shine like the stars
I knew that I was wrong
Knew that I would fall
But it didnt matter, cause I was with you
And you were with me
You were so perfect
You were the one who let
This heart come back alive
With the way that I felt inside
I dont care if I am wrong
Dont care if I will fall
All that matters is that you could see
What you do to me
When I see you
When I see you

Who I Am 
You said you would dance around
If there was sound
You said you would paint my heart
Back into placeagain
I said you were everything
Anyone could ever dream
You said I was kindly blind
No one wants me
One look in your eyes and I was blinded
One touch of your hands and I was moved
One scent of the fragrance that surrounded you
And the truth of it all is that you saved me
You asked me why tonight?
Why someone like me?
Ill tell you the same thing
I said to you that night
Its because for once in my life
I did something right
It felt like we stood there for hours
Just starin into the sky
But the true display was right beside
When I saw the work of God in your eyes
O yea
I saw that work of God in your eyes
And I was so astounded 
Cause you didnt even know
The air was filled with laughter, with love
And your eyes
One look in your eyes and I was blinded
One touch of your hands and I was moved
One scent of the fragrance that surrounded you
And the truth of it all is that you loved me

Wishes 
-Verse 1-
Look inside the mirror and tell me what you see
Is it a lost or broken memory?
And I cant try to find a reason why
You find yourself in my arms tonight
Ive tried and tried until I fell down
The reasons why you cannot feel the ground
-Chorus-
Cause youre an angel, youre feel cant touch the ground
And the places that you lost were never found
Its an unknown reason I cant explain why
Cause I just make wishes when I look in your eyes
-Verse2-
Falling down is only halfway up
When youve fallen for the most beautiful girl
And she reads to me the stories of her life
When shes lying in my arms
She says Evan, why cant I hear the sounds

Go upstairs find some food
Come downstairs then i splooge
These are happy days of mine
The kind you'd like to find
I just want this day to end now
I can't help but feel i missed out
I just want this day to end now
I hope things will try to work out
Clearly take my time
We have never been satisfied
Clearly stear me blind
We will never be satisfied
9 to 5 5 alive
5 to 9 9 is dead
Drain the pool whats the use
Eat a stool the lines are dead
Ask your friends to be kind
Ask the teacher when does it end
So pack your bags and your suitecase
Theres no more time you lost again
Clearly take my time
We have never been satisfied
Clearly stear me blind
We will never be satisfied
So now its the end of the day
Where your friends are untrue
And their letters are gay
Well i've got nothing to do
In a town thats shut down
Cause the heat when away
All the colours in the rainbow aren't enough for me
I want them all radio infrared and MTV
I've tried this one last time
My floor's a waste of time
So stop this stalling we're back to being boring
Clearly take my time (Take what was mine
We have never been satisfied what was mine
Clearly stear me blind what was mine
We will never be satisfied what was )
I just want this day to end now
I can't help but feel i missed out
I just want this day to end now
I hope things will try to work out

I remember when you cried 
With your eyes on fire 
With the gale in your lungs, 
Screamed your throat red 
But now it's getting colder 
What happened to you? 
You're on your deathbed 
I remember when you laughed 
With the sunlight on your lips 
Sun rising high 
On your early morning smile 
But you're not waking up this time 
Breathless cries over lifeless eyes 
Your body is here, but you're not 
That thing that screamed with me 
And dreamed with me 
That thing that laughed with me 
And cried with me 
That same thing lies before me 
On this deathbed

Idefy 
Call it a lie 
Call it a crutch 
Call it denial 
Say it's an escape It's only the fear sought 
to beguile 
Say I've lost my tear 
Say I've lost my self doubt 
Say I've lost my life 
Say I've copped out. 
I defy you 
Soul is reality 
Regardless of what your beliefs may be 
Experiments? Proof? 
But are you brave enough to enter the laboratory? 
Transcendence perceived but will you open your eyes? 
A searcher, but are you willing to find? 
Or just remain content 
Wrapped tight in popular lies 
Say no one can know

No one no more 
I know I'm someone,

Crouched in a lonesome corner I shiver

My only cold companion

Will you suddenly, you where never alive (inside). When death closes your eyes. Wide, wide eyes of fear, I hear: death is howling near, what if I suddenly find, "success" was wasting my time? What if I suddenly find, I was never alive? When death closes your eyes. Is dust all that we live for? All that we know? Is dust all that we live for? Brace to face, embrace the void, how will aour loving lover comfort you? What will be the worth to all your winnings in this world, when ashes comes to dust? As this body must. When death closes your eyes. Abandon the death-life, re-ignite the light inside

He wants to be your reservoir of pleasure 
And wants to be your heart's only treasure 
Your everything, your only-thing 
Your god, he wants to be your god 
How far you fall for it  how far you fall 
He's the only he

Sex turns you (us) to stone and that's reality

Friday Morning 
Thrown into the light / Taught how to believe / Learn to love / Learn to hate / Then learn to read the lines between / We've looked at our past mistakes / And learned that time can heal your wounds / Stand tall with pride at any stake / But the reminder of a scar will stay too soon / The victory of life / The forfeit chose in death / The goals we all chase / Closer with our every breath / Arms wide open now / Waiting for that sweet embrace / The tears we hold back / For fear of one's disgrace...
Somewhere off in candyland theres an answer to our prayers / Theres a reason for the suffering / Our expression's in the air / The story moves along / Human saga must go on / Don't sleep / Don't dream / Don't even look outside
Thrown into a world / Taught how to conform / Learn to breathe / Learn to see / Then learn to join the swarm / We've marched up to the edge / Together we could take it all / We stare down at that ledge / And contemplate the fall / The ecstasy of life / The mystery of death / The doom that haunts us all / Closer with our every breath / Eyes wide open now / Just too good to waste / Everything we know / Is only our first taste...

Horizons 
Here we are again, standing alone on the brink of emptiness / Prepare for one more goodbye, as the stars begin to dot the sky...
Will you become that stranger alone? / The stars and stripes that mock you flying high above your home... / What will it be like the next time I see you? / Will you ever change your self centered world view?
Where are we going? / And I don't know where we will stay / A handshake and smile, and no kiss goodbye / And we'll each be on our way
Please look after everything while I'm gone / When I'm not back tomorrow carry on / The juggernaut of time works itself in tricky ways / The dancing lessons of bokonon define the path we take...
Why have we come here? / Has our mission been acomplished yet? / A formal goodbye, with no questions why / As we continue on our quest
Somewhere in the distance, the future tells our tale / The ships that we have built ourselves have already set sail / Someday things might make sense, its not just bullshit / An answer, a reason... someday we'll find it! / Stories have passed, I'll keep ours in mind / Lost in the fray however frozen in time / I looked into the future

Although I may not know what the future has in store / I hope it's not all as corrupt as the house next door
The new neighbours are moving in, first doing some construction / With the help of low wager mexican day laborers / They brag to us like it's joke, pretend to be decent folk / Human rights are second best, we honor most our own best dressed / They're moving in any day now, things have changed we see and how / Our greed and pride lead us in, overlooking our own sins

A call to arms nobody hears / Our efforts fallen on deaf ears / And though our goals seem palpable / Attaining them seems unclear / Though no one will tell you you're wrong / As the dollar sign strings us along / Its time to evaluate / The reasons we belong / But when our freedom takes away theirs / It does not ring out everywhere / As we exercise our right to take / Everything thing that's there
As the corporations we support, quickly take over the earth / We take more than we need, while others go hungry! / Keep the third world on their knees, down subservient to us / There's nothing we can do! that's not fucking true!
But if we cant break the walls they build / We still can change our lifestyles / If we cant break the walls they build / We still can change our lifestyles
My life wont be sold, chasing down the dollar sign / Wear a corporate soul, to replace the one you sold / To prosper at the sake of others is not why I'm alive / We take more than we need, to justify our greed!
No motives unclear, prosperity driven / Our revolution, must come from within / If I never give up and you never give in / We can change the world we live in!

When you look back on the best night of your life will you remember the things you were wearing? / The car you arrived in? / The beer you were drinking? / No you'll consider the friends you were with and the experience itself
So I say throw it all in the fire / Gain control by letting go / Forget what you want / Live at peace with your home, evolve!
When you look back on what you've accomplished don't you hope to have gained something more than material? / A two week vacation? / A story with no moral? / I'd rather look back and believe I'd made a difference / Maybe not to you, maybe nobody's listening
We still haven't found our way...
So I say throw it all in the fire / Gain control by letting go / Forget what you want / Live at peace with your home, evolve!
Just hoping I might change somebody's mind, first I'll openly admit it's the blind leading the blind / Just hoping I might change somebody's mind, first I'll openly admit it's the blind leading the blind / That's why I'm still standing here! / Thats why I'm still waiting!

Who are we to stand here in the way of "progress"? / How foolishly hubristic we are... / To think that we might almost start to make a difference / Stand in the way and flail our arms...
You can talk about the things that make you more upright than me / You can say that nothing matters...but everything matters too much for your apathy
Who are you to question our morality? / Like any of us want to hear your outcry... / Your superficial thoughts lost in the massive ocean / We can't change that but we try...
Scattered and few, beaten and bruised - our disbanded union / Lost and confused, time falling through, I promised I'd be here / Where the fuck are you?
Mr. nowhere is from the wrong side of the tracks / He earns less than me because he's black / As hard as it may be to fess up to this truth / Xenophobic ideas infiltrate our youth, and / When we're older will we think that it's alright? / Will our children inherit the fight left hanging? / I won't give up or give in I hope to say / That my commitment will remain...
Man destroys earth, man destroys man, reality's a trip I can't understand / I saw a vision oh-so wrong, it was the world I know except I was gone / All too real, and all too strange, never existed, I was a silent name / Saw my dad, and saw my mom, everyone just carried on... / No one knows exactly where this shit began / So this is simply where I stand... / And this is just where I stand / (Still dreaming, still screaming

The Decay Of Modern Man 
Eyes opened to a world of flashing lights / Of sleepless nights... in apartments / Playing and telling a sorry tale to a drunken crowd / He can't afford the rent / A book of matches, a cigarette, and a forgotten art / Describes the job, yet his drinks come free of charge / And with each gulp his blurred vision clears...
Putting depressions into lasting impressions / He sees everything and nothing all at once in a windowless vision / Full of liquor and pipe dreams...
His world is found hidden underneath the American Dream / Which peels away revealing scabs that fester and bleed / He can do nothing but provide the soundtrack to lifes more melancholy moments / He dislikes individuality and therefore owns similar suits in which to dress / 99 black and 1 blue, bought in his fleeting moment of weakness...
A gaze into his eyes / Reveals white on white... Emptiness, Emptiness / And yet the wrinkles on his brow depicts the decay of modern man / That's what he's searching for? / To be the modern man? To be the common man?

The Last Fish 
Upon one foggy afternoon, a foolish man ran out of room / In his garbage can so he, threw his trash into the sea / He did this time and time again, the sea still looked fine to him / He saw no reason to stop this, until the day he met a fish... / The fish told him you're a fool, who will clean up after you? / Don't throw your garbage near me, we don't want it in the sea / But the fish was never heard, 
&
 instead the mean just spread the word / Before long everybody disposed of their rubbish in the sea... / That's where it all fell apart! / The water's color slowly changed, and the sea was quickly drained / Of the life that had lived there, it was now almost completely bare / The man returned, one rainy day, but not to throw garbage away / He planned to catch some fish instead, not knowing they were mostly dead / The man fished all day and night, but simply nothing would bite / Caught some boots and metal chains, but threw them back to where they came... / When the sun came up the next day, the man give in when he began to pray

Wheel Goes Nowhere 
Every time I look into this board of abstract numbers I pretend to see things that simply are not there / Surrounded by others in my same position trying to give some value to their cold blank stare / I wonder whats the point of useless education as we stress out learning someone elses' number games / Running like hamsters 'cuz this wheel goes nowhere and every time the outcome's just the same
There is no free thought when (Education?) / Our minds are bound in chains (I think not!) / Was this system designed to stunt our minds / Or just conveniently work out this way?
I'd like to think there is more to our lives than just math and science twice a week phys. ed / And I'd like to think that I see through the system but consumerism permeated my head / We try so hard, we bite our nails to make a million dollars and fill our role / Why fight the norm and a million before us and be at the disadvantage of the others... who've already sold their souls?
One future no choices, One future no changes / A hush to our voices, now silent, now painless / And as the sun sets on our dying rebellion / That trigger not fired, our revolution expired

24 Hours 
Here on the street
Feeling the cool of the dawn
Shuffling feet
Faces are ragged and worn
They've been working all night
Waiting for the curtain to rise
While you're under the sheets
You with the stars in your eyes 
Letter box noise
Snapping the day into life
Newspaper boys
Cutting the mist like a knife
We're beginning to rise
Curtain up the drama begins
It's the start of the race
All of us wanting to win 
People rushing shouting pushing
Got no time for conversation
Inner city population
The struggle for communication
People trying pressure rising
Hook and hustle flex your muscle
It's all part of living
Do you wanna get away 
Restaurant smells
Mix in the heat of the day
Telephone bells
Kissogram girls on her way
Someone's thinking of you
Birthday boy is in for a treat
And the message is clear
Once a year life can be sweet 
Caught in a flash
Cover girl freezes her smile
Media trash
Blinding the crowd with such style
It's a dazzling affair
A fantasy to star in your dreams
Do you want to believe
Everyone knows what they've seen 
Twilight time in the city
And the shutters are down
That's when the singles are lost in their doubles
The happy hour comes round
To help you unwind in the shadows
Takes the tension away
It's been a hell of a day in the city
Now it's your time to play 
Living under pressure
Do you wanna buy a dream? 
I say Phil can you get it he say
Alright alright alright
Tell me when can I get it he say
Tonight tonight tonight
I want money on delivery hey
That's right that's right that's right
I say baby don't you trust me he say
The city's a jungle where the strongest survive 
Neonic heat
Flooding the darkness with light
The capitol beats
Feeding the pulse of the night
It's the music of life
Listen to the sound of the crowd
Where the rhythm's so strong
And the music is playing so loud 
Where the rhythm's so strong
And the music is playing so....

He's moving into action man
He's looking good but maybe
He's in the wrong direction man 
But he wanna get a little, get a little
Every night, get a little, get a little
Something for his appetite
Everybody needs to have a recreation
Everybody needs a little comfort for the soul 
You'll never make it in a motown suit
No way to fake it man they're not your roots
No, you'll never make it in a motown suit
You can't be a drummer without rhythm
Can't blow your horn if you ain't blue
Some folks they just ain't got it in 'em
Tell me boy now does that sound like you 
He's cruising with the singles
Down the margarita bar
He's boring to distraction
Pushing words and talking stars
(What's your sign) 
He's gotta take a little, take a little
On the side, make a little, make a little
Something for his appetite
Everybody needs a little lubrication
Someone with imagination got to break the ice 
You'll never make it in a motown suit
No way to fake it man they're not your roots
No, you'll never make it in a motown suit 
You can't be a lover without rhythm
Don't blow your horn if you ain't true
No point in playing Valentino

Can't blow your horn if you ain't blue

Age Of Consent 
I want to meet you at that restaurant
The one you love it's got a pretty front
What a front
The girls are holding hands
It's a treat to indulge
Or we can sit awhile and look around
Look around, round round
Look around, round round 
This is the age of consent
You don't have to be coy
This is your own pleasure bent
We are here to enjoy everything
Everything that the traffic allows  
We touch each other then we sip the wine
We smile and nod together, this is fine, it's so fine
Come on in the water's fine
We can jump right in
Or we can look around and bide our time
Look around, round round
Look around, round round 
This is the age of consent
But you don't need to shout
This is your own pleasure bent
We are here to enjoy everything 
I'm not holding you back Heaven's sake
Have you got to jump out of the cake
I don't want your endeavours to fail
But that pouch has got a sting in the tail
Sting in the tail 
This little place has got me in a trance
We're getting closer but it's just a dance, just a dance
The band won't make a sound
We can warm it up
Or we can hold it back and look around
Look around, round round
Look around, round round 
This is the age of consent
But you don't need to shout
This is your own pleasure bent
We are here to enjoy everything
Everything can be yours, but don't shout....

Americana Panorama 
Martin Luther B.B. King
You had a dream and you make us swing
Doctor Winston J.F.K.
You had a dream but they blew you away 
Americana panorama
Big apple rice banana
Bit but keep your backs against the wall 
Pretzel logic does apply
Oh fast food junk food gets you by
You got delis diners southern fries
And burgen queens with hungry eyes 
That's Americana panorama
Aerobatic instant karma
Run but do your jogging in the car 
Tricky didn't make it
But his part deserves an oscar
When he proved that you can fool the people
all the time
And from the Rockies to the Hudson
Everybody loves a winner
Turn a blind eye to corruption
While the nation grows
Oh oh I feel the pressure rising
You're on top of the world but it's about to blow
Do you know what you're doing?
Do you know? 
Take a look at what you've done
You are the shape of things to come
It's science fiction coming true
You can shoot the stars it's up to you 
Americana panorama
Living in a TV drama
Turn it off and make the dream come true
Oh oh Americana panorama
Living in a TV drama
Turn it off and make the dream come true

Gotta make her quick as you can
Give her lovin' make you a man
Get her in the palm of your hand
Bread from Heaven 
Gimme a country
Where I can be free
Don't need the unions
Strangling me
Keep me in exile the rest of my days
Burn me in hell but as long as it pays

Baron Samedi 
I'll show you man who walk on fire
And don't get burned
Don't get burned, don't get burned
He don't get burned
I'll show you man who tread on glass
And he don't get cut
Don't get cut, don't get cut
He don't get cut 
You can take a knife and slit his throat
And he won't drop dead
Won't drop dead, won't drop dead
He won't drop dead
Been a ju-ju boy for a thousand years
And he ain't cut yet
Ain't cut yet, ain't cut yet
He ain't cut yet 
Hold 'em
You've got to crease 'em and fold 'em
You've got to shape 'em and mould 'em
Take a piece of their soul man 
Well he can take a little moonlight
Suck the poison from a snakebite
Movin' round about midnight
He's got the power of life 
See the sacrifice of the virgin women
See the deadly snake and the headless chicken
Take a sip from dripping red
Make it with the living dead 
Take you up when you feeling down
When you're sick he will come around
Takes his cures from out the ground
He's the one who can hypnotize
And you'll never believe your eyes
He can cause the dead to rise

Bee In My Bonnet 
I got a bee in my bonnet
Got a chip on my shoulder
I got a hole in my shoe
And my toes are getting colder
I got ants in my pants
I got fries in my thighs
I got a bone in my nose
I got frit in my ass 
I got a bee in my bonnet
Got a chip on my shoulder 
I got a flee in my ear
I wear my heart on my sleeve
I got a ticket for the train
And I'm ready to leave
I got a rockin' pneumonia
and the boogie woogie flu
I got the palpations
All because of you 
I got a bee in my bonnet
Got a chip on my shoulder 
I'm burning, with love 
I got my fish on the line
I got my hand in the water
I know right from wrong
So I do what I oughta 
I laugh in the day
I cry in the night
Woo hoo baby
Gonna be alright 
I got a bee in my bonnet
Got a chip on my shoulder

She doesn't need money
She doesn't need diamonds
She's lookin' for pretty things
She doesn't want romance
She doesn't need finance
She's looking for rendezvous
But every time she's going down
She never looks around
I'll wait and watch her with my
lens until she brings the curtain down
'There behind the keyhole'
with my fisheye
I'm back in the darkroom
I'm covered in fixer
I'm making a photograph
I'll send her some postcards
In glorious colour
I'm keeping the negatives
I'll form a letter from the news
With different type from different lines
I'll tell the world about her
I'll mail the People and the Times
'Oo it'll be so scandalous
For the both of them
But mainly her'
She showed them her husband
He ordered a dozen
He thought they were fabulous
The one with the --
The two of the --
And three of the --
He sold her to Hefner
Who put her in Playboy
He gave her a centre-fold
I made a real blunder
She made it in movies

Bluebird 
Bluebird take me on your wing
Teach me how to fly
Teach me how to sing
Bluebird, guardian of my soul
Inside everybody
Is a story to be told 
I came in from the cold
When I found someone
Strong enough to bear
The strain of our existence
And troubles everywhere
But time heals
And I know you'll be there... ooh  
Bluebird symphony in flight
Symbol of the dawn
Symbol of the night
I'll try with all my might to be a brother
Always there for you
Mother (mother, mother) knowing what to do 
And farther than anyone has flown
Courage to spread your wings alone
And who will help me?
Bluebird 
Bluebird stranger to these shores
I look into your eyes
Have you been here before 
Take me through the door to Heaven
And show me
The treasures that you keep
The magic of the sky
And the beauty of the deep 
And I'll do what I have to do
To be one of the chosen few
Fly anywhere with...
You, Bluebird 
Bluebird, Bluebird (Yeh)

Brand New Day 
When you open your eyes
To a brand new morning
And the sun shines 
Above you
You pull on your breeches and say
Oh well,
It's the start of a brand new day 
For birds of prey
You live and learn your life away
But there below, your body must go
Against the grain
Like an old mule train
Keeps pulling hard against the 
Here boy, there boy
The boss got you running everywhere boy
'Ya got no money and ya got less sense
And you ain't going nowhere'
But there below your body must go 
For birds of prey
You live and learn your life away
But there below your body must go
Against the grain
Like an old mule train
Keeps pulling hard against the 
Here boy, there boy
The boss got you running everywhere boy,
'Ya got no money and ya got less sense
And you ain't going nowhere'
But there below your body will go 
At the end of the day
When you look around you
And the sun sets
Deep inside you 
Dust off your breeches and say
'Oh well'
Say goodnight to the man in the moon
The sandman's on his way

Channel Swimmer 
Well it's cold down here in the water
It's cold down here in the sea
Who'd be a channel swimmer?
Only a fool like me 
I've greased my body
and I'm heading over the ocean
These two arms are the only locomotion
I need 
See me swim and see me float
I don't need no motorboat
or a yacht to get me there 
I'll do the breaststroke
and the backstroke
I'll do anything
I'll be swimming when you're all asleep
I'll be swimming when you're all awake
I'll do the sidestroke
the other sidestroke
I'll do the butterfly
But I ain't gonna crawl
on back to you, no way 
I see your face in every breaker
I see your smile across the reef
I came across the sea to take you
Don't make me out to be a thief 
You'll be dreaming when you're all asleep
But I'll be drowning when you're all awake
I did the breaststroke
I did my best stroke
I did everything
But I ain't good enough 
'Cause it's cold down here in the water
It's cold down here in the sea
Who'd be a channel swimmer?
Only a fool like me
Who'd be a channel swimmer?
Only a fool like me...

Charity Begins At Home 
a shake of the tin
the money drops in, but is it a sin
you're standing in rags
you're selling your flags
but who gets the dough at the end of the day
we saw your drop-dead fancy wheels
your little house up on the hill
but when your conscience pricks
a little sacrifice sweetens the pill 
so keep your hands in your pockets
charity begins at home
keep your hands in your pockets
charity won't leave you alone 
we take to the stage
the audience rave, we're doing our bit
a heavenly cast, a blast from the past
there's a song to be sung, will it make number one
we wanna see your money roll
but our eyes are on the hall of fame
'cos business is business
and hits are the name of the game 
so keep your hands in your pockets
charity begins at home
keep your hands in your pockets
charity won't leave you alone 
everywhere that we turn
there are mouths to be fed
how can we sleep
the battle goes on while we're
safe in our beds
so don't turn away
no don't turn away 
your doors are locked
you switch on the box to take in a show
you think that you're safe
but here comes that face
and wouldn't you know it's that message again
they want to take your plastic cash
your hand reaches out to the phone
keep your hands in your pockets
charity begins at home 
keep your hands in your pockets
charity begins at home
keep your hands in your pockets
charity won't leave you alone 
everywhere that we turn
there are mouths to be fed
how can we sleep
the battle goes on while we're
safe in our beds
so don't turn away

But when the sun comes up
And the party's over
I don't care I'm coming back tonight

Pull on your boots brand new suit

And a shot of midnight fever

Get on the beat shuffle your feet
Never know you might get lucky

Flashing like a neon
Feed 'em a line

Going out of my mind

Tick a tick a time bomb
Tick a tick a time bomb

Advertising that our time is running

Oh with just one minute to live
Oh, no you'll never get me up in one of these again
'Cos what goes up must come
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down 
Oh, the gravity of the situation
It's only my willpower
That keeps this thing in operation
But we're gonna crash that's for certain
The pilot is too busy flirtin'
And he ain't aware
That there's a bomb down there
And if he don't do something it's curtains 
"Now just hold on,"
Said the little bomb,
"If you were just to hold my hands
Then time would stop
The plot would flop
And jumbo would be safe to land" 
Tick a tick a time bomb

From Chattanooga to Japan
I taxi through the airways -
What a swell little plane
What a fine little plane
What a great little plane

I'm a clockwork wreck
And though my fuse is burning slow
Must keep my date to detonate
Goodbye, ta ta, and cheerio

Code Of Silence 
Deep in the night
I can hear you calling my name
How can I try to help you woman
If you go on hiding your pain
Baby, Baby, the tears on your pillow are real
You can't go on pretending to me
when I see the pain that you feel 
A code of silence, is a dreadful thing
It can make you feel harder
It can keep you hanging on a string
Here in the darkness
When I hear you calling my name
A code of silence is a deadly game
It's a deadly game (what's that you say)
It's a deadly game (speak to me now)
It's a deadly game (deadly game) 
Lost in your dreams
Trouble on your face in the pale moonlight
Nowhere to run you've got to let me know
Where you are standing tonight
Baby Baby Baby
I know that you're hurting inside
Open your heart
I know that we can make it
If you talk to me now 
A code of silence, is a deadly thing
It can make you feel harder
It can keep you hanging on a string
Here in the darkness
When I hear you calling my name
A code of silence is a deadly game
It's a deadly game (what's that you say)
It's a deadly game (speak to me now)

when something crazy takes me far away
we must stick together through this madness
i've got so many things I want to say 
too many forces try to come between us
so little time to share and talk to you
if i show my hand to you in panic
please remember what i'm going through

i didn't want it this way
don't think i don't trust in you

before the world we knew was torn apart
now when i close my eyes i can be with you
but are we really dancing in the dark 
a bad connection leads us to confusion

Hello there
How have you been
I've called a million times
But to me you're never in 
I know I never had the style
or dash of Errol Flynn
But I loved you 
I'm doing really well

I got a new apartment
It's as safe as Central Park
And if they ever mug me 
When I'm walking in the dark

And I got loady do di dodied
Lousy violins began to play
I went no no no
And as the vol-au-vents exploded
I was walking down the aisle the other way 
Don't hang up

Don't say, Oooh
Nobody's safe in our house 
Leave me alone
But a but a please
Leave me alone
Just a mo, a minute
I'm so alone

Some honeymoon on itchy bedding
Scum buzzing round your busy body
Dumb waiters waiting sweating straining
All mass-debating my woman 
We got a

Crumbling about our ears, Ole

You got a dustbin romance
It's going down the drain 
You got a low impedence
She's got a rocky terrain 
Oo, you got a lot to learn
Oo, you got a lot to learn
You got a lot to learn about women
A lot to learn about women women
What's to learn about women
We've both got a lot to learn 
Surprise surprise
There's a hell of a well in your eyes
Have we won the no Nobel Prize
Has the colour run out of our dies 
Surprise surprise
There's a hell of a well in your eyes 
When the barman said "What're you drinking?"

If you want love to stay
Don't give all your secrets away
It's not the fashion
But hold back your passion 
Don't - open your heart, no

Give her some time and 
Don't - drive her away, no

Feed in the hunger 
Hold back your passion 
You're not an open book

Under the cover
Let her discover 
Don't - stop the surprising, no
Don't - take all the mystery out of it, no

Kill her desire

Dreadlock Holiday 
I was walkin' down the street
Concentratin' on truckin' right
I heard a dark voice beside of me
And I looked round in a state of fright
I saw four faces one mad
A brother from the gutter
They looked me up and down a bit
And turned to each other 
I say
I don't like cricket oh no
I love it
I don't like cricket oh no
I love it
Don't you walk thru my words
You got to show some respect
Don't you walk thru my words
'Cause you ain't heard me out yet 
Well he looked down at my silver chain
He said I'll give you one dollar
I said you've got to be jokin' man
It was a present from me Mother
He said I like it I want it
I'll take it off your hands
And you'll be sorry you crossed me
You'd better understand that you're alone
A long way from home 
And I say
I don't like reggae no no
I love it
I don't like reggae oh no
I love it
Don't you cramp me style
Don't you queer on me pitch
Don't you walk thru my words
'Cause you ain't heard me out yet 
I hurried back to the swimming pool
Sinkin' pina coladas
I heard a dark voice beside me say
Would you like something harder
She said I've got it you want it
My harvest is the best
And if you try it you'll like it
And wallow in a Dreadlock Holiday 
And I say
Don't like Jamaica oh no
I love her
Don't like Jamaica oh no
I love her oh yea
Don't you walk thru her words
You got to show some respect
Don't you walk thru her words
'Cause you ain't heard her out yet

Dressed To Kill 
Put your money where your mouth is
Get your finger on the buzzer
Paint it on
Show the bumps
Cos you're really gonna jump tonight
Can you fell you're getting ready?
Don't you see it in the mirror?
Show it all
Show too much
Hey, you're really gonna jump tonight 
Drink in all that funky stuff
Take it till you've had enough  
Put your image in your pocket
Hang your collar in the closet
Cause a crash
Make a splash
Cos you're really gonna wipe 'em out
Getting rid of inhibitions
Makes a little exhibition
Turn it on
Lossen up
Cos you're really gonna wipe 'em out 
Dressed to kill, she wanna play with you
Watch your step, she's gonna run you through
Dressed to kill, she's got amazing grace
Watch the Devil, with an angel's face
Drink in all that funky stuff
Take it till you've had enough 
So you're lookin' like a million
And you're getting the attention
Play 'em up
Turn 'em on
Boy they're really gonna work tonight
Hey he's sittin' in the corner
Like a little Jack Horner
Make him break
Take his cake
Oh he's gonna be your fool tonight
Catch him with that funky stuff
Take him till you've had enough

Everything Is Not Enough 
It doesn't help you if you scream and shout
That isn't what this thing is all about
And do you really want to fight to win
You're missing out and that's another sin
Your dream of power is a sacrifice
Do you really want to pay that price
Just think about it and you'll change the pace
Look in the mirror tell me who do you face
Who is that? 
It's everything, everything is not enough
I want it all, that's tough, that's tough, that's tough
Another dream, another dream, another dream goes pop
This is the time, let's stop, let's stop, let's stop  
Nobody loves you if you moan all day
So take it easy then you'll get your way
You ain't no dummy and I'm sure you know
You know it's better if you let it go
You're in control if you let it go
You're feeling better when you let it flow
You never really had to catch the moon
You're better jumping to another tune
So let's jump 
It's everything, everything is not enough
I want it all, that's tough, that's tough, that's tough
Another dream, another dream, another dream goes pop
This is the time, let's stop, let's stop, let's stop 
It's everything, everything is not enough
I want it all, that's tough, that's tough, that's tough
Another dream, another dream, another dream goes pop
This is the time, let's stop, let's stop, let's stop (do, do, do it) 
I've got it all but it's not enough
I keep thinking "Boy I feel so rough
This can't be me, I'm such a happy guy"
I laugh a lot but I want to cry
A cry for help is just letting go
It hurts a lot but I think I know
It's time for change I don't need the hype
It's time for change and the time is ripe
So let's go 
It's everything, everything is not enough
I want it all, that's tough, that's tough, that's tough
Another dream, another dream, another dream goes pop
This is the time, let's stop, let's stop, let's stop 
It's everything, everything is not enough
I want it all, that's tough, that's tough, that's tough
Another dream, another dream, another dream goes pop
This is the time, let's stop, let's stop, let's stop 
It's everything, everything is not enough
I want it all, that's tough, that's tough, that's tough
Another dream, another dream, another dream goes pop
This is the time, let's stop, let's stop, let's stop...

Everything You Wanted To Know About!!!! (Exclamation Marks) 
I took my fantasy to Deborah
You know she's always been a friendly girl
You'll see her cruise the Picadilly streets
And she winks at every man she meets
I've been a fan of hers for quite a time
I tried to pull her with a bummer line
I asked her would she like a cigarette
And she said let's go to bed
('cause that's what you want) 
And so I went
And I was shocked
I was so green
Ground I wish you'd swallow me up
She had to laugh
I nearly died
Some Superstud!
There's more to this than meets the eye 
I hurried back to read the manual through
You know the one that tells you what to do
But all I needed was the confidence
To start and break the ice
Experience would be a boon for life
And Debbie smiled as I came strolling by
I said I'd like to have a second shot
And I'd give it all I've got 
And with a twinkle in her eye
She led me by the hand
Through a door to a room
Above a Soho restaurant
And she smiled and told me
Not to look so serious
But by the time she'd talked me down
I was delerious, I was away 
I had to window shop in Amsterdam
But down the Troubador in Hollywood
I found a lover who was bold enough
To live my fantasy (this isn't a dream) 
I was away
Up in the blue
Emmanuelle
How you gonna make it in a jet
The need to shock
Was coming through
Where would it end
You'll never know

Feel The Benefit 
[REMINISCE AND SPECULATION]
You went out on the street without your shoes on
You didn't listen what your momma said
She said you won't feel the benefit, won't feel the benefit
And if we all went out without our shoes on
Tell me where would we be, where would we be 
If all the people in the world lost their reason
What would we see, where would we be
If all the entertainers in the world lost their music
What would they play, what could they say
To pacify the crowd, to justify themselves
Won't feel the benefit 
You're like a cloud behind the sun
Like the face behind the clown
You're moving like the wrinkles in a frown
And you can never look back
A leaf that's borne upon the wind
A cardboard suitcase in your hand
The wanderer soon returns
And finds the colour of the grass is just the same
On the other side of the tracks, oh no 
["A" LATIN BREAK]
Ooh when you smile it's like a holiday
Ooh pack your bags and we can get away
We'll float on a Queen down to Rio
There's no need to shave
We'll be stinking like rum in a punch 
You can walk on the water
You can dabble in the mumbo jumbo
You can smoke a little ganja
Float like a cloud over Rio, Rio
You can ride with the Gauchos
Swinging your bolas in a red bandana
You can run with the devil
Takin' your chances with Senorita 
You can drink a lot of coffee in Brazil
But the bill is gonna make you ill 
FEEL THE BENEFIT 
So, you can go out on the street and take your chances
But if you do, you better do it right
Or you won't feel the benefit, won't feel the benefit
Spin the wheel and take your chances
And your number might come up
Though the odds may be in favor of the house 
If all the people in the world would say together
We're all black and white, we're all day and night
If all the people in the world could sing together
How would it sound, what would we feel 
We'd all feel the benefit

Feel The Love (Oomachasaooma) 
I saw you so pretty
Your face lit up the city
Two worlds came together
The memory stays for evermore 
So different your fashion
You were the main attraction
Heads turning in wonder
I felt myself go under
(Oomachasaooma...)
'Ooh I'm a drowning man
Save me please
I need you so give me a helping hand 
[CHORUS]
Nothing can stop you when you
Feel the love
No chains can hold you when you
Feel the love
Don't try to fight it when you
Feel the love
Nobody matters but the one you love 
My intro I fumble
My facade starts to crumble
So strange your reaction
I made the right connection now 
You got me no bother
I can't see any other
The world keeps on turning
I wouldn't care if it was burning
(Oomachasaooma...)
'Ooh I'm a drowning man
Save me please
I need you so give me a helping hand 
[CHORUS]
It's a million to one
You should find the right door
But there's no guarantee
You'll find what you're looking for
Don't give up if you blow it the first time around
But you've got to beware
If you're walking on air
Keep your feet on the ground
(Keep your feet on the ground) 
Don't stop me I'm not dreaming
I can't ignore this feeling
Your love is my lifeline
You're so right so fine so glad you're mine
(Oomachasaooma...)
'Ooh I'm a drowning man
Save me please
I need you so give me a helping hand

Fill Her Up 
my baby told me she would meet me on the street
stood behind a lamppost, I could only see her feet
now I'm not one to grumble, don't want to be a bore
but that silly bitch Jane Fonda's got a lot to answer for
told the women of the world that the only way to win
work out 'til you burn out and you'll get super slim
i rushed her to the restaurant and called the maitre d', oh help me 
fill her up, fill her up
load up, load up
fill her to the top
fill her up, fill her up
keep it coming, keep it coming
never let it stop 
we staggered from the restaurant feeling in the pink
i slipped into the liquor store and gave the man a wink
my baby got the shivers, said you've got to stop and think
what you're doing to your body with this evil demon drink
said the poison that you're buying gonna eat away your brain
i said you'd better listen up before you go insane
knocked her off her soapbox, rushed her to the bar, and shouted 
fill her up, fill her up
down 'em, drown 'em
fill her to the top
fill her up, fill her up
keep 'em coming, keep 'em coming
never let them stop 
that's right, one more
tequilla sunrise with a little umbrella on it
okay, encore
a bloody mary with a little shot of bourbon on the side 
too many moaning minnies
they're out to spoil our fun
watch out for sister anna
she's the one who bangs the drum
bang the drum 
now you may think i'm worried by the screwballs that i meet
just to prove i'm not i'll throw a party in the street
everyone's invited, but you've got to take the pledge
leave behind your scruples, let me take you to the edge
everything in moderation that's the golden rule
take away all pleasure, that seems kind of cruel
to give the people power got to give them fuel, so i say 
fill em up, fill em up
lead em, feed em
fill em to the top
fill em up, fill em up
everybody, everybody
never let it stop 
fill em up, fill em up
lead em, feed em
fill em to the top
fill em up, fill em up
everybody, everybody
never let it stop 
fill her up, fill her up...

For You And I 
The world is full of other people (ooh ooh)
take a look around
We're quick to laugh when they've got troubles (ooh ooh)
and we put 'em down 
We go
We're not so hot you know
It's like a roller coaster
On a downward motion
On a one way street
We can't control our feet
We're on the road to ruin
Don't know what we're doin' 
She may be quiet
She may be shy
But don't you bring her down
Don't pass her by
The world of wisdom behind her eyes
Could answer everything
But you and I 
We seem to wander in a daydream (ooh ooh)
We never look around
The world is full of other people (ooh ooh)
and we put 'em down 
We go
We're not so hot you know
It's like a roller coaster
On a downward motion
On a one way street
We can't control our feet
We're on the road to ruin
Don't know what we're doin' 
She's not beautiful
But don't make it plain
You underestimate
It's not a game
A heart of gold
Behind the drab
Would comfort anyone
But you and I 
Should try to see it from the other side (oooh)
We'll get a shock
It could surprise you 
The world is full of other people (ooh ooh)
take a look around
We set the pace while others listen (ooh ooh)
never make a sound 
The rain must fall
But we can change
Our understanding
will remain
So take a moment
To wonder why
The world keeps turning

Fresh Air For My Mama 
So say one and so say all
Say what you gotta say
Or don't say nothing at all
You been tossin' and turnin' through soft sticky nights
While the Bronx below you fights to stay alive 
So say one and so say all
Be what you gotta be
Or don't be nothing at all 
Be gracious to your mother
When you leave this neighbourhood
The change is going to do her good
Next to me you look bad
'Cos there ain't no fresh air for my momma, my momma 
But the drop is shear
When you break away 
Take me away
It's just about time to hit the road
And say
You gotta believe in something
It's easy to see
My God is fading away
So pick up your bible and pray for me 
We're all alone in the darkness
But our eyes are wide open
We don't see nothing
And our hands are tied
To the railings of the Bowery
And the humid city slickers
So say one and so say all
We had a lot to say
And we said it all 
The cost of living in dreams
Is rising like a crime wave
The American way of dying 
And it gets you every time
And it looks like it's got to my momma
My momma
May she rest in peace

Head Room 
I've never been kissed before
It's been on my list before
A flick of the wrist before would do
But when you get down to it
It's got a good sound to it
Don't meddle around with it
'Cos it's far too wet to woo 
When Mummy and Daddy play
They tell me to go away
But by hanging around
I can learn all the rules
Now I got the technique
I'm away 
Develop a taste for it
A time and a place for it 
Although on the face of it, it's a crime
I've nibbled the cheese of it
The birds and the bees of it
Are weak at the knees
From making honey
Every time 
I'm throwing my toys away
I'm leaving the boys to play
With the boys
Gimme girls
And it's time I was breaking away 
Just gimme some head room
Just a little bitta head room
I need some leg room
Just a little bitta leg room
I see myself Oh Lord
I see a mess 
I'm making a meal of it
I'm breaking the seal of it
I'm getting the feel of what to do
It's got a good ring to it
I'm getting a thing for it
And if there's a sting in it
I'll have met my Waterloo
My Mummy and Daddy said
You're liable to wind up dead 
Oo, they've been shooting me a line
Maybe it doesn't exist at all
Oo, I've been towing the line
Now I'm hook line and sinkered 
I've never been kissed before
It's been on my list before
A flick of the wrist before would do
But when you get down to it
It's got a good sound to it
Don't meddle around with it
'Cos it's far too wet to woo 
I've thrown all my toys away
I'm leaving the boys to play
With the girls that you get
For a dollar a day
When you pull on their strings they say 
Just gimme some head room
Just a little bitta head room
I need a ball room
Up against the wall room
I need the rest Oh Lord

Oh, it's so fine, and you know what's mine is mine 
At night we, sleep tight we
Stay close together 'cos the temperature's down
But baby, says maybe
Each time I try to get my fingers around 
Please don't touch her 
Sittin' with a tentpole, what a bloody jamboree
Listen to our motto, be prepared for ecstasy
Here comes the bride 
My baby, goes topless
And brings her beauty to a bottomless day
She's bathing, al fresco
And all her mystery is there on display 
So, don't get too close
Oh she's so fine, and you know what's mine is mine 
Ooh it's a drag when you're hitched to a dream
And the boys in the gang think she's part of the scenery
You're never alone and the tension is painful to see 
One night I, crept in and,
Got on my knees and tried to make her my wife
One reef knot, two grannies
And we were bound to stay together for life 
Now we'd like to....

Hotel 
On de uber side ob de island
Dere's a sky so clear and blue
Can see, cross water, to de mainland
New life for me and you 
Let's buy a hotel
Let's get a yacht
We'll get a golden island
In the sun made of coconut
Let's buy an old car
We'll crash in a hut
We'll feed the food to the Ford
And we'll live off the coconut 
Well there's a big black mama
In a tree
She's gonna cook us
She's gonna call up the rest of the tribe
And it looks like the ghost of Tarzan lied
He went over to the other side
And he rang like a bell
From tree to tree 
They never ever let you go
They never ever let you go 
We get American menus
With all American men
We're getting sick of things American
We ate our way through half the Pentagon
We had our share of big palookas 
Yankee go home

Hot To Trot 
She had a shake like a belly dancer
and a body like a tiger tiger (uh huh, uh huh)
She was looking at me 
Now you know that I ain't no dancer
But there's gotta be a way to meet her
So I just walked up to her and said
Are you hot to trot? 
Well I knew I was looking cool
Pretty sharp like a razor razor (uh huh, uh huh)
She was smiling at me 
So I said if you got the notion
We could take a little trip to the ocean
She said that'll be OK
'Cause I'm hot to trot 
We were having a ball by the water
Talking about life and philosophizing (uh huh, uh huh)
She was really talking to me 
She said I can't understand why you gotta hustle
Struttin' and posin' and flexin' muscle
So I said, well that's easy baby
I'm hot to trot

How'm I Ever Gonna Say Goodbye 
I've been thinkin' writin' you a letter
Maybe telegram would be better
I'll be worried how it's gonna get there
So I go and change my mind  
Need a little time to chew it over
But every day I grow a little older
Got de devil sittin' on me shoulder
Gonna make me change my mind 
Got me drinkin' even got me smokin'
Got me sinkin' nearly got me chokin'
What'll you do in the morning
What'll you do in the morning
When I'm gone 
Thought I'd better have me a vacation
Got my ticket made my reservation
Want my name address and occupation
So I go and change my mind

How'm I ever gonna go to sleep at night
How'm I ever gonna close my eyes

You'd better not annoy me or I'll do 
Somethin' that you won't forget in a hurry
And I might be back for some sloppy seconds 
You've heard me heavy breathing on the telephone
My word they say that I'm belongin'
In a home for crazy people
But you know I don't belong there

I Hate To Eat Alone 
I picked myself up in a downtown bar
You know the feelin' was lousy
But as I'd come this far
Well it's too easy to drink
When nobody's home
But I hate to eat alone 
'N' frozen dinners don't do much for me
When you've got T.V. on the table
'N' T.V. on T.V.
All you do is chew your fingers
Down to the bone
I hate to eat alone  
Like the actor who's forgotten his words
You stumble through the story line
Another place another time
When you were with me 
They say the city's rotten to the core
There's no communication with each other anymore
But we stopped talkin' to each other a long time before
And I hate to eat alone 
Hear it in my words
See it in my eyes
Since you went away
I wear a cheap disguise
Waitin' for the mornin'
Waitin' on the light
Hopin' for the sunshine
Before the night 
I didn't tell you that I had to change
So you just took it for granted
That we'd remain the same
I know that nobody's guilty
No one's to blame so I end up on my own
God I hate to eat alone
I hate to eat alone
I hate to eat alone
I hate to eat alone

I'm Mandy Fly Me 
Just like a rollin' stone
I'm outside lookin' in 
But if your chance came would you take it
Where on earth do I begin
I'm Mandy fly me 
I've often heard her jingle
It's never struck a chord
With a smile as bright as sunshine
She called me through the poster
And welcomed me aboard
She led me she fed me
She read me like a book
But I'm hiding in the small print 
Won't you take another look
And take me away
Try me Mandy fly me away
The world was spinning like a ball
And then it wasn't there at all
And as my heart began to fall 
I saw her walking on the water
As the sharks were comin' for me
I felt Mandy pull me up give me the kiss of life 
Just like the girl in Dr. No No No No 
Ah when they pulled me from the wreckage
And her body couldn't be found
Was it in my mind it seems
I had a crazy dream
I told them so but they said no no no no 
I found me on a street
And starin' at a wall
If it hadn't have been for Mandy
Her promise up above me
Well I wouldn't be here at all
So if you're travellin' in the sky
Don't be surprised if someone said Hi
I'm Mandy fly me

I'm So Laid Back, I'm Laid Out 
The people were running
The place was on fire
The smoke was a-growing
And the flames were getting higher 
The fire chief was shouting
As he knocked down my door
He said you better move your butt boy
Or you'll knock on heaven's door 
I'm so laid back, I'm laid out
I'm so caved in and spaced out
I'm wired to the teeth
I'm fused to the floor
So baby don't you bug me no more
Don't you bug me no more 
The rent needing paying
The insurance was due
The roof needing fixing
And the rain was coming through 
But the forecast is sunny
So I'll stay here on my back
Tomorrow is another day
It's cozy in the sack 
I'm so laid back, I'm laid out
I'm so caved in and spaced out
I'm wired to the teeth
I'm fused to the floor
So baby don't you bug me no more
Don't you bug me no more 
There were times when you wanted to be number one
And the glamour and the glitter were turning him on
But he realized that it was better to be number two (ooh)
My luxury is living
'Cause I can't afford to die
I'm a diletantic mother
With a twinkle in my eye 
Let the others do the running
I'm content to take a cut
Percentages are burning
And I'm happy in my rut 
I'm so laid back, I'm laid out
I'm so caved in and spaced out
I'm wired to the teeth
I'm fused to the floor
So baby don't you bug me no more

To a dream
Hoping that time
Would turn your fear away
But you must stop
Take a look around

They've got no business to talk

Where reason is a waste of time
Nobody talking

Touching you deeply
Way down inside you
Do you wanna be loved
Say you wanna be loved

When it feels so right
But I must find out
Take a look around me
What do I feel
What'll I do 
You see I've been hanging on
To a dream
Hoping you'll find
The love you need in me
Giving you time
To make your mind up
Do you wanna be loved
Say you wanna be loved 
People say that I'm crazy

I Took You Home 
I looked at your face somehow I knew
Nothing could tear me away
You started to smile and I was lost
Fumbling for something to say
I took you home, you took me in
I knew I'd never be the same again
Baby, isn't it funny how it started
Well you know 
The windows were frosty and grey
But we didn't notice the cold
Wrapped in the warmth of your body
Hoping this dream would never go
I took you home, you took me in
I knew I'd never be the same again
Baby, isn't it funny how it started
Well you know  
Your folks were sleeping soundly upstairs
We couldn't really turn on the light
So I stumbled and we fell in the dark
I could have died
It's crazy to remember all the reasoning
I wonder if the memory will ever fade away 
I looked at your Father and I smiled
He said it was time for me to go
Stumbling out into the morning
Hoping my feelings didn't show
I took you home, you took me in
I knew I'd never be the same again
Baby, isn't it funny how it started

Just got out of school

With his girlfriend on the back seat
Looking for some action
And they found it down a back street
Suddenly a truck pulled out
He tried to step on the brake

Oh well her skin it was softer than velvet
And her eyes were as bright as a child's
Her lips were a promising picture
Warm and celluloid
But her words had me thinkin' too deeply
The meaning be-lying her face
Made me look just a little bit closer
Between the lines 
L.A. smiles to hide the frown
L.A. promises to follow you down
L.A. teeth, and L.A. hair
L.A. curves that shouldn't be there
They really shouldn't be there 
She said you've got to be seen at the Roxy
The strippers will know who we are
But you've got to be seen to be happy
You're a Tinseltown Star
You're going upwards and downwards and sideways
Man you're really caught up in a dream
With your head burning under the starlight
From the studio scene  
L.A. smiles to hide the frown
L.A. promises to follow you down
L.A. teeth, and L.A. hair
L.A. curves that shouldn't be there
They really shouldn't be there

L.A. insatiable, you don't have to go
L.A. charisma 
Well she knows all the famous musicians
Sometimes she sees how they play
And when the back stage passes are going
She really knows how to pay
She's a product of rock 'n' roll livin'
She's a victim of Hollywood hate
She's a soul survivor
She's the midnight special
Gonna lay you to waste 
L.A. smiles to hide the frown
L.A. promises to follow you down
L.A. teeth, and L.A. hair
L.A. curves that shouldn't be there

Last Night 
Last night
You know you really really
made me appreciate my life
When you took me to the seventh floor
And closed the door
I didn't stand a chance
Oh oh that night
When my conscience was losing
in that age old fight
Now I've always been a non-believer
A true deceiver
A hit and run romance 
Don't you know that when we turned out the light
We were riding on the crest of a tidal wave
Like we were ships in the night
Going nowhere 
Last night
When the feeling was missing
but the mood was right
From the moment we took the floor
I knew for sure
We'd play the parts we're expected to
I've done it so many times 
Man we're all inmates of the human zoo
Our bodies in control of our minds
I played the jester and you played the fool
You kept forgetting your lines
I had to prompt you with a bourbon or two
Huh, you planned to come all the time 
But when we turned out the light
We were riding on the crest of a tidal wave
Like we were ships in the night
Going nowhere (nowhere) 
Oh last night
You know you really really
gave me something to write about
In the morning it was just the same
I'd lost again
But it won't take me long to forget
Oh oh last night

Les Nouveaux Riches 
I could see that the sun it was deadly
She's putting her hand in the fire
Her velvety skin it was cooking
Lily white, lily white turning to raspberry
But when she slips in between the sheets tonight
the memory will linger and burn
And when she look at the face in the mirror
What a terrible sight
Lily white turning to raspberry
(When it burns you rub on the lotion
if it stings you sit in the ocean, oh no)

tres fatigue they fly, off to the sunshine
they set jet away, they don't

I could see that the guys were a hassle
She tried to handle them cool
But her interbreeding was showing
tumbling out on the banks of the old
swimming pool, oh oh oh
So she buried her fears in a bottle
the juices beginning to flow
But her stiff upper lip it was trembling
tripping her up, her words were beginning to roll
Hush your mouth, you can't fool the natives
telegraph, they's going to relay it, oh no

tres fatigue they fly, off to the sunshine

I remember the tears in her eyes
She tried to hide them away
But her time it was going too quickly
Just another few days, she'll soon be flying away
But her memory will stay here forever
A time she will never forget
All the sun and the sand and the water
Such a beautiful place, she never got her feet wet
No way, she keeping a cool head
She got a tan, from under the sun bed, oh no

Life Is A Minestrone 
I'm dancing on the White House lawn
Sipping tea by the Taj Mahal at dawn
Hanging round the gardens of Babylon
Minnie Mouse has got it all sewn up
She gets more fan mail than the Pope
She takes the mickey out of all my phobias
Like signing cheques to ward off double pneumonia 
Life is a minestrone
Served up with parmesan cheese
Death is a cold Lasagne
Suspended in deep freeze 
I'm leaning on the Tower of Pisa
Had an eyeful of the tower in France
I'm hanging round the gardens of Madison 
And the seat of learning
And the flush of success
Relieves a constipated mind
I'm like a gourmet in a skid row diner
A fitting menu for a dilettante 
Life is a minestrone
Served up with parmesan cheese
Death is a cold Lasagne
Suspended in deep freeze
Love is a fire of flaming brandy
Upon a crepe suzette
Let's get this romance cooking, honey
But let us not forget

Served up with parmesan cheese
Death is a cold Lasagne

Dont' got talkin' in your sleep no
Don't go givin' it all away
Don't go walkin' in your sleep no
Don't go givin' it all away
Dont' got talkin' in your sleep no
Don't go givin' it all away
Don't go walkin' in your sleep no
You're ten thousand miles away 
Livin' it up in the paradise
Don't make it right, don't make it wrong
When you know you've got a friend
who's at the other end
And a telephone line's like a life line 
But a walk on the wire
It don't put out no fire
A telephone line's like a life line 
Dont' got talkin' in your sleep no
Don't go givin' it all away
Don't go walkin' in your sleep no
Don't go givin' it all away
Dont' got talkin' in your sleep no
Don't go givin' it all away
Don't go walkin' in your sleep no
You're ten thousand miles away 
When you wake you'll find me sleepin'
The clock don't stop when you're not here
But you know you've got a friend
Who's at the other end
And a telephone line's like a life line
A telephone line is a life line

Listen With Your Eyes 
I don't need no special things to get me high
All I needs a touch of Ron to get me by
I see people travelling, never make a move
I don't follow my leader, needles in the groove
I don't like sitar, it don't touch guitar
People selling me heaven, praying to the sky
I don't read their message
Listen with your eyes
Listen with your eyes
Listen with your eyes (I love it) 
You've had a hustling day
Your life's roundabout anyway
I got my feet on the ground
That doesn't mean I don't get around
I get up on tops and down on Mr. Blue
I love to see a daybreak
It's not a chemical wide awake
I like a rub in the tub
I never want to pull out the plug
I get up on tops and down on Mr. Blue
Mr. Blue! 
People search the dailies, live by horoscope
Looking for direction, don't they get the joke
I won't fear the reaper, when the curtain falls
I'm not vegetating, waiting for the call 
I don't like sitar, it don't touch guitar
Wake up to the future, you should make your plans
Dreams are made in heaven, life is in your hands
Life is in your hands
Life is in your hands
Life is in your hands

Lost In Love 
A far bit beyond this place
All the stars have been cast
You may try to resist the pace
But it's happening too fast
The desire is so strong
Yeah you got to concede
There's no way to escape from the trap
We are slaves to our needs 
And we're lost in love
(Y'say) We're lost in our love and we can't find a way
And we're lost in love
(Say it) We're lost in our love and we're destined to stay together
Whoa, heart to heart, forever
Whoa, heart to heart, together
Whoa, heart to heart
Heart to heart 
The stage has been set tonight
And the die has been cast
Curtain up and the music begins
Oh the audience cares???
Tragedy is feelin'
For the rest of your days
Nothing will ever compare to the thrill of the stage 
And we're lost in love
(I'm sayin') We're lost in our love and we can't find a way (baby, baby)
Lost in love (no, no)
(Sayin') We're lost in our love and we're destined to stay together
Whoa, heart to heart, forever
Whoa, heart to heart, together
Whoa, heart to heart
Heart to heart 
Curtain will fall at the end of the day
Guardian angels will kill for their pay
Impossible dreams have to end
Let the crowd disappear, we've got nothing to fear 
We're lost in love
We're lost in our love and we can't find a way
We're lost in love
We're lost in our love and we're destined to stay
Lost in love
Lost in our love and we're destined to stay
Lost in love
Lost in our love and we're destined to stay
Lost in love
Lost in our love and we're destined to stay
Together, whoa
We're lost in love
We're lost in our love and we can't find a way
We're lost in love
We're lost in our love and we're destined to stay
Together, whoa
We're lost in love
We're lost in our love and we can't find a way
We're lost in love
We're lost in our love and we're destined to stay
Together, whoa

Lying Here With You 
Time to wave the day goodbye
But I don't wanna hear no lullaby
Sandman takes his cue
And when the night is through
I'll be lying here with you 
Close your eyes turn out the light
Say a prayer to see us through the night
Hope your dreams come true
When dawn turns into blue
I'll be lying here with you 
Too much of something
Tends to spoil you so they say
But I can't get enough of you
I tell you something
I never listen to what they say
I only know what I must do 
All our cares will drift away
Leave them all until another day
I don't really mind
As long as I can find
That I'm lying here with you 
Too much of something
Tends to spoil you so they say
But I can't get enough of you
I tell you something
I never listen to what they say

Man With A Mission 
There's a man at the top
And I know that he's pulling the strings
He's got his eye in the sky
And I know that he sees everything
There's a bug on the phone
Got his eye on the fly on the wall
But the man in the street doesn't know
'till the guillotine falls 
Then he drops before you realize
Bullets hit you right between the eyes 
I'm a man with a mission
Got my foot in the door
I'm the man with a mission
And I'm breaking the arm of the law 
There's a voice in the air
And you welcome it into your home
But the snake in the grass
Is the power behind the throne
While you sit in your castle
The enemy's scaling the wall
If you don't make a sound
There'll be no one to answer your call 
The evidence is there in black and white
Your number's up for grabs if you don't fight 
I'm a man with a mission
Got my foot in the door
I'm the man with a mission
And I'm breaking the arm of the law 
I'm a man with a mission
got an ace up my sleeve
I'm the man with a mission
And your trapped in the web that I weave 
Open your eyes - see the lies while you dance in the dirt
Open your eyes - to the lies while you still got a chance
Open your mind - and you find that you're locked in a trance
Stars in your eyes - they make you blind this is not a romance 
The evidence is there in black and white
How long will it take you to see the light? 
I'm a man with a mission
Got my foot in your door
I'm the man with a mission
And I'm breaking the arm of the law 
I'm a man with a mission
got an ace up my sleeve
I'm the man with a mission
And your trapped in the web that I weave I'm a man with a mission
Yeh, I'm a man with a mission

Margo Wants The Mustard 
I watch her move up and down the beach, well
The fellows drool, but she's out of their reach, and
These are not a part of the scheme, but
Let them hope, and let them dream
So many dreams in the mind of the men, well
Come to life through a good woman
Margo walks in another place, well
It's in her eyes and it's on her face 
Some like it cool
Some like it hot
Some give a little
Some give a lot
Some wanna give everything that they've got  
Margo wants the mustard
Yeh, she needs a little spice
Margo wants the mustard
Then she'll spread it on her life
Margo wants the mustard
Yeh, she'll never ever stop
Margo wants the mustard
It will take her to the top 
She's only got to smile that way well
It lifts your heart, blows your troubles away, and
When she moves, well I've got to say that
This rhythm method goes a long, long way
It's in the bones, and it's in the head
A precious thing that's got to be fed, well
I shouldn't say it, but it must be said
It's even better when it's in your bed 
Some like it cool
Some like it hot
Some give a little
Some give a lot
Some wanna give everything that they've got 
Margo wants the mustard
Yeh, she needs a little spice
Margo wants the mustard
Then she'll spread it on real light
Margo wants the mustard
She'll never ever stop
Margo wants the mustard
It will take her to the top
(A wop bop a loo mop, a lop bom bom) 
I can't explain what she motivates, but
It's all around, but it's hard to relate
It must be close to heavenly bliss oh
How I wish I could bottle this and
I'd splash it out all over the place
Pour it over the human race, yeh
I may be starting another sin, but
Sit right back, watch the fun begin 
Some like it cool
Some like it hot
Some give a little
Some give a lot
Some wanna give everything that they've got 
Margo wants the mustard
Yeh, she needs a little spice
Margo wants the mustard

Marriage Bureau Rendezvous 
Well I've been lookin' after number one for too long
And it seemed the love was passing me by
So I thought I better do something about it
And that's why I'm sittin' here lookin' cross the table at you
That's why I'm sittin' here lookin' cross the table at you 
Well a lonely man needs a Marriage Bureau
Where they sit you right down and you fill in a form
Would you like a blonde or a black or a blue rinse
Do you like 'em small, love 'em slim long and tall
Do you like 'em small, love 'em slim long and tall 
Oh no, too many questions 
I'm looking for a girl like Momma used to be
She's cooking up a dream, she's baking ecstasy
Won't it be fine when
I find her 
Would I like to take her to a movie or the theatre
Would I pick her up at home or would I like to meet her
Somewhere we could take a good look at each other
Smile and say hello or walk away
Smile and say hello or walk away 
So I'm squeaky clean in and out of the bath
I never shaved so close before
I'm gonna put on a tie, I'm gonna shine up my shoes
I'm gonna slick back my hair, I've got nothin' to lose
Oh, oh, I'll be stinkin' so good
like I'm drowning in a sea of cologne 
Hey... do you know you remind me of someone
But I'm here making eyes at you
And I think we're gonna say goodbye to the bureau
Close the files, turn the page, start anew
Close the files, turn the page, start anew

Memories 
The summers were longer, they went on forever
Oh and the sky so blue
We never worried about anything
We didn't question the nature of things
We didn't want to know
Talking in whispers and wondering
Oh and I loved you so 
Memories, they linger with you but you
soon forget that we started in innocence
Memories, they linger with you but you
soon forget when you're grown 
We dream in the night, of mythical days
And nights in white satin
But when the child wakes, the fantasy breaks
We didn't know what the future would bring
We didn't want to know
Something was growing inside me
Oh and I loved you so 
Memories, they linger with you but you
soon forget that we started in innocence
Memories, they linger with you but you
soon forget when you're grown 
Photographs, faded photographs
Holidays, summer holidays
First love, broken promises
All a play, I'm going back to yesterday 
The feeling was stronger, if went on forever
Oh and your eyes were true
We were so wrapped up in all of our dreams
We didn't care what the future would bring
We didn't want to know
Talking in whispers and wondering
Oh and I loved you so...... 
Memories, they linger with you but you
soon forget that we started in innocence
Memories, they linger with you but you

Modern Man Blues 
I'm tired Lord and I'm drawn
And I'm chilled right to the bone
I crawled home from my work
And this note said she was gone
Said your dinner's in the cat
And your love is out the door
I'm goin' back to my momma
And I don't want you no more, no more
She said she don't want me no more
She's gone back to her momma
Said she's never never comin' back no more 
Now a man can take so much
And only heaven knows his limit
But a naggin' bitchin' woman
Digs a hole and puts him in it
A sophisticated man
Needs a little something on the side
So what you don't get at home
You've gotta get outside, hey 
She's gone
I'm spending all of my money
She's gone, gone, gone
And I can swing with my honey
She's gone
I'm so glad my woman's gone 
Now time goes marching on
And it won't wait for you
You've gotta take it when it's offered
And get it when it's due
Now a man can move much faster
Without a millstone around his neck
So if you get the chance to lose it
You've gotta drop it and run like heck, hey 
She's gone
I'm spending all of my money
She's gone, gone, gone
And I can swing with my honey
She's gone
I'm so glad my woman's gone 
She's gone
I'm spending all of my money
She's gone, gone, gone
And I can swing with my honey
She's gone
I'm so glad my woman's gone

Notell Hotel 
I checked into the room and I checked the view
And then I locked and chained the door
I had time to kill I had space to fill
Like a prisoner on the floor
But then the silence broke, there's a woman
screaming down the hall
And I wondered what was going on
Here at the Notell Hotel 
So I killed the light and I slipped the chain
took a peek into the hall
I was just in time to see the waiter trip
and drop the dinner on the floor
But the Bellboy smiled as the elevator started to fall
And I wondered what was going on
down at the Notell Hotel 
Ooh, I love a mystery (cover up and intrigue)
Life can be a thriller, a fantasy of everything I see
Ooh, how I love a mystery (turned up raincoats)
Secret agents, waiting for the missing clue
at a rendezvous 
I heard the sound of feet and I looked out to
meet a girl I knew I'd seen before
She had the kind of looks, you see in dirty books
and she was dripping on the floor
She was taking a shower when someone tiptoed in
and turned out the lights
It's gonna be one of those nights
down at the Notell Hotel 
I took her into my room and picked the lock on the bar
to get a drink to calm her down
Then the mirror cracked as the window shook
and the table turned around
And when I grabbed at the phone
there was a voice at the end of the line
"Is that 1059? Is anything wrong, Is there anything wrong"
here at the Notell Hotel 
Ooh, I love a mystery (cover up and intrigue)
Life can be a thriller, a fantasy of everything I see
Ooh, how I love a mystery (turned up raincoats)

Nothing Can Move Me 
There's talk about some people
That maybe you know
The heroes and the villains
And the places that they know 
The highest and the finest
The lowest of the low
Just stop and get it through you
There's somewhere you can go 
Tell you what I do when I'm lonely
I'll tell you what I do when I'm blue
Tell you what I do when I'm lonely
I close my eyes and think about you 
[CHORUS]
('Cause) nothing can move me like my rock n roll
Nothing can blow me away
Nothing can move me like my rock n roll do
Nothing can move
Nothing can move
Nothing can move me away 
You wake up in the morning
The wrong side of the bed
The spirit that was in you
is hammering your head 
You crawl up to your hi fi
Select a side or two
Sharpen up your needle
and feel it coming through

You promised me a life
You promised me everything would change
Even said you'd be my wife

Oh Effendi 
In the middle of a caravan
On a four wheel drive oasis
There's a man with a thought in mind
To cash in on the desert faces
He's got a truckload of Yorkshire girls
For your harem going places
And the border bums never saw
The guns in the whiskey cases 
There's a real, big demand
And it's written in the palm of his hand
He's gonna change the face of the desert
He's gonna sweep away the sand 
Hang on sheik, I've got a yellow streak
I ain't here, I'm a mirage
Get back Des, keep it under your fez
And don't give us away in the massage 
Look what I did for the pyramid
I put a pool in and made it pay
I built an elevator and a film theatre
And I shipped it to the U.S.A. 
'Cos there's a real big demand
And it's written in the palm of my hand
I'm gonna change the face of the desert
I'm gonna sweep away the sand 
Hang on friends!
There's a lot more goodies in the pipeline
So this ain't the time to close the deal
Here's the deal
Ooh, now you've got a Howitzer all of your own
Ooh, and a Panzer division to chauffeur you home
Gun running is fun
But hang on, friends, hang on friends 
Allah be praised, there's a whole new craze
We're gonna shoot up the foreign legion
And it's up with the sheik
And down with the frog
We're gonna liberate the region! 
Oh Effendi, we're gonna bury your head in the sand
Oh Effendi, you better get off my doggone land 
Hey, Prince of the moonbeams
Son of the Sun,
Light of a thousand stars
Your gorillas are urban
And there's bourbon on your turban
And the sun shines out of your ass 
Oh Effendi, I'm gonna grovel in your wake
Oh Effendi, it's all been a big mistake 
You're gonna cut out my liver
If I don't deliver
Things are getting out of hand
I'm going to ride off into the sunset and
Make a deal with the promised land 
Goodbye friends
There's no more goodies in the pipeline

Old Mister Time 
He looked funny
The children called him the scarecrow
An old raincoat
And baggy trousers and sneakers
he found at the dump
Oh, but if you bothered to look
There was something behind the rags
Oh there was a look in his eyes
It was something you'd never forget 
He lived badly
A broken shack on the railway
An old moggy
The only one who replied
When he talked to the walls
Oh we didn't understand
We were fooled by the dirt on his face
Oh we were human then
We were searching behind his disgrace 
Why don't you leave me alone
Why don't you go to your homes
Why don't you keep to yourselves
I'm tellin you
Why don't you leave me alone 
You're never gonna realise
When all you do is criticise
You're never gonna make it work
You never seem to get enough
You crumble when its getting rough
You're never gonna make it work
I'm tellin' you there'll come a day
You're gonna blow yourselves away
It's wrong that I should interfere
I just get in the way 
Why don't you leave me alone
Why don't you go to your homes
Why don't you keep to yourselves
I'm tellin you
Why don't you leave me alone 
Deep into the night
He was working by the light
of the candle by his bed
on the theory in his head
He was building from the junk
that he rescued from the dump
And when he turned the power on
There was a sound and he was gone 
Oh in the gray of the dawn
We discovered the thing he was working on
Oh we didn't understand
The future was Old Mister Time
Future was Old Mister Time
Future was Old Mister Time
Future was Old Mister Time
Old Mister Time (Mister Time, Mister Time....)
Old Mister Time (Mister Time, Mister Time....)
Old Mister Time (Mister Time, Mister Time....)

Only Child

No brother to tell my troubles to
My nights were oh so sad and lonely
Until the day that I met you

Don't want to lose what I have found
'Cause I'm an only child

Overdraft In Overdrive 
I got a letter this morning
My overdraft's in overdrive
They wanna know what I'm gonna do about it
How I'm proposing to survive
Stay alive stay alive oooh
They want the money
so I work and work and work ......
They're making me roast
The cheque's in the post
You needn't worry worry worry....
You hit the roof when I'm on the floor
Did I ever let you down before 
I got a letter from my broker
He say he broker than me
My silver mine has tarnished over
I'm on the road to tragedy
Help me, help me, oooooh
I need the money
so I work and work and work.....
I'm deeper in debt, I'm covered in sweat
You make me worry, worry, worry....
This nightmare's giving me the shakes
Hope I wake and find it's all a mistake 
I started with nothing, and worked my way down
I know the things that I do, they mystify you
It's a strange way of living
But I like playing with fire
I'm always walking the wire
And when the tightrope snaps
You'll see my world collapse 
I got a letter this morning
Must be my lucky day
Seems I've inherited a fortune
Rich Uncle Sam passed away, away, away, ooooh
I'm in the money
No more work and work and work.....
My banker's aghast, I'm dripping with cash
No need to worry, worry, worry.....
You need an angel to survive

Walk under buses and burn their wings
People like us do nothing right
Talk to the ceiling into the night 
Look at the smile in her eyes

I feel the turnin' of wheels as it grows
Look at my face in her eyes

Ooh sitting alone in the dark
Ooh feeling you close to me
We're in a dream
But the hands on the clock seem to know
Tell me it's time to go 
People in love play silly games
Running in circles and everywhere
People like us can make believe
Love is forever and I'll never be 
Ooh sitting alone in the dark
Ooh feeling you close to me
We're in a dream
But the hands on the clock seem to know
Tell us it's time to go

Ready To Go Home 
On the street below these walls
Where I used to walk
Now I can barely crawl
All this darkness rising tall
Lord shine a light for me
I'm waiting to be called 
I'm ready to go home
I'm ready to receive
Forgiveness for my sins
I'm ready to begin 
Take this river to the sea
Where the Delta flows
The tide is washing over me
Guide this soul to Heaven's door
Show me where tomorrow lies
I'm waiting to be born  
I'm ready to lay down
I'm ready now to sleep
A promise I must keep
I'm ready to go home 
So tired I lay down
With these memories
Breathe shallow deep inside of me
If time has run its course with me
Then 
I'm ready to go home
I'm ready to receive
Forgiveness for my sins
I'm ready to begin 
When the evening shadows fall
When the time has come
I'll let defences fall
To surrender's to survive
I will give up everything
To those I leave behind 
I'm ready to go home
I'm ready to receive
Forgiveness for my sins
I'm ready to begin 
I'm ready to lay down
I'm ready now to sleep
A promise I must keep
I'm ready to go home
Again

Reds In My Bed 
There's a fat man who offers a change of scene
Says he'll guarantee my sheet will be clean
When I get on the outside
But who can you trust when the walls have ears
I'm for takin' a chance, like a drownin' man
I'm going under 
I've got reds in my bed
I'm not easily led to the slaughter
And while the cold war exists
I'll stay warm with the commisar's daughter 
We could meet at the zoo where the tiger roams
In a prison of steel
He reminds me so much of the way I feel
And we know that we're both in the danger zone
Where the eyes of the world
Full of shutters and bugs are upon us now 
I've got reds in my bed
I get blues looking out of my window
And we're never alone, there's a tap on the phone
And my pillow 
Let me go home
(There's a girl in a distant land)
Let me go home
(Who's nothing more than a memory)
She don't know that I'm gonna be free
Let me go home
(You're a land full of misery)
Let me go home
(You're a cruel and a faceless race)
I don't like your philosophy
I don't like your philosophy 
The connections are made and the time is right
So my body is walled in the shell of a car
in the dead of night
And I laugh through the pain and the agony
As they cut me away to be born again
back to humanity 
You've got reds in your bed
There's a man lookin' over your shoulder
But don't you give him your mind
It's too late when you find that it's over
You! 
Let me go home
(You're a land full of misery)
Let me go home
(You're nothing more than a memory)
I don't like your philosophy
Let me go home
(You're a cruel and a faceless race)
Let me go home
(You're nothing more than a memory)
I don't like your philosophy

Rock 'n' Roll Lullaby 
Listen while I sing you to sleep
With a rock 'n' roll lullaby
Close your eyes and don't you peep
This is a rock 'n' roll lullaby
Sandman's gonna get you 
Snuggle down your sleepy head
It's gettin' late the Sandman said
Your dreams are waiting
It's daybreak in the land of nod
So get to sleep you little sod
Your dreams are waiting 
And if you get a nightmare
Would you go and shake your Ma
Cause your Daddy's been a workin' all day
And if you go and get a glass of water by yourself
You can show us that you're older than you are
Show us that you're older 
The Sandman's gonna get you 
Well you're too small to understand 
You're living in a wonderland
Your dreams are waitin' 
If only we could be there too
And dream a dream along with you
Your dreams are waitin' 
Careful that you don't get out the wrong side of the cot
Are you gonna be an angel or a devil
You're too small to reason what is right and what is wrong
Childhood dreams are gone too fast
There's no way we can make them last 
We'll always love you anyway
Any way you are
Any way you are

Rubber Bullets 
I went to a party at the local county jail
All the cons were dancing and the band began to wail
But the guys were indiscreet
They were brawling in the street
At the local dance at the local county jail 
Well the band were playing
And the booze began to flow
But the sound came over on the police car radio
Down at Precinct 49
Having a tear-gas of a time
Sergeant Baker got a call from the governor of the county jail 
Load up, load up, load up with rubber bullets
Load up, load up, load up with rubber bullets 
I love to hear those convicts squeal
It's a shame these slugs ain't real
But we can't have dancin' at the local county jail 
Sergeant Baker and his men made a bee-line for the jail
And for miles around
You could hear the sirens wail
There's a rumor goin' round death row
That a fuse is gonna blow
At the local hop at the local county jail 
Whatcha gonna do about it, whatcha gonna do
Whatcha gonna do about it, whatcha gonna do 
Sergeant Baker started talkin'
With a bullhorn in his hand
He was cool, he was clear
He was always in command
He said "Blood will flow;
Here Padre
Padre you talk to your boys..."
"Trust in me -
God will come to set you free" 
Well we don't understand
Why you called in the National Guard
When Uncle Sam is the one
Who belongs in the exercise yard
We all got balls and brains
But some's got balls and chains
At the local dance at the local county jail 
Load up, load up, load up with rubber bullets
Load up, load up, load up with rubber bullets 
Is it really such a crime
For a guy to spend his time
At the local dance at the local county jail
At the local dance at the local county jail 
Whatcha gonna do about it, whatcha gonna do
Whatcha gonna do about it, whatcha gonna do

Runaway 
Remember I'm the one who didn't have a lot to say
I was trying to find the courage, but I let you walk away
And I can't forget your face, y'know it haunts me all the time
And it seems to me you're living in a dream 
[CHORUS]
Wish we could run away, and we could be alone together
Far away, and leave the world behind
Runaway, what I want to say is
You're a part of me, let me be a part of you 
Want to tell you what I'm thinking, but the words get in the way
When I'm sitting here alone I find the things I meant to say
If I wrote them in a letter, would you read between the lines
Would you understand how much I really care 
[CHORUS]
(I) I love you
(Need) I need you
(You) Don't want to live without you 
If I'm backward counting forward, would you help me realize
All the answers to the questions I've been asking with my eyes
I could hand you all the cliches, but you've heard them all before
And I want to say I love you in my own way 
[CHORUS]
And could we run away...

Sand In My Face 
I looked in the mirror
(What did you see looking at you?)
I saw a nine stone weakling
(What will you do?) 
Dynamic Tension waiting for you?
Dynamic Tension make a man out of you 
I opened my magazine
(What did you see?)
I saw Mr. France
(What did he have?)
A girl on each shoulder
(What else?)
And one in his pants 
Dynamic Tension can do this for you
Dynamic Tension make a man out of
You you you you you 
So our hero goes down to the beach
He's in real terrible shape
His chick's been seen with big Alex
That mother kicked sand in his face
Now let me tell you about Alex
He's got:
Hands like hams
Knees like trees
200 lbs
Of surfboard Hercules 
Mr. Atlas won't you bring her on back to me
I lost my girl down by the beach
She's with Alex and she's out of reach
So please Mr. Atlas won't you bring her on back to me
I saw your body in an advert on T.V.
But what convinced me was your money back guarantee 
Now I'm stronger than Alex
(Where is he now?)
He's left in disgrace
(Oh yeah?)
'Cos I took back my girlfriend
(Ha, ha, ha, ha)
And kicked sand in his face
(In his eyes, in his ears, in his nose) 
Dynamic Tension waiting for you
Dynamic Tension make a man out of you

Shine A Light In The Dark 
i've been lost before and i had to pay
it was never easy but i found a way
well the journey was hard and the road was tough
there were times when i cried lord i've had enough
please don't desert me now
don't you leave me stranded now i need a friend
please don't desert me now
you've gotta show me mercy when i'm helpless 
show me mercy when i'm helpless
shine a light in the dark
hold me back when i get reckless
shine a light in the dark
stand me up if i get legless
shine a light in the dark
shine a light in the dark
shine a light in the dark 
i've been down and out and i've been fit to drop
but the thought of you wouldn't let me stop
now a man should stand upon his own two feet
because the taste of failure is a bitter sweet
please don't desert me now
i can hear the reaper calling in the wind
please don't desert me now
you've gotta show me mercy when i'm helpless 
show me mercy when i'm helpless
shine a light in the dark
hold me back when i get reckless
shine a light in the dark
stand me up if i get legless
shine a light in the dark
shine a light in the dark
shine a light in the dark 
where were you when the chips were down
i fell apart when i hit the town
where were you when i couldn't get arrested
where were you when the lights went out
i blew a fuse, did you hear me shout
where on earth do i look for heavens sake 
there's a brotherhood that i want to see
gotta take my share of equality
there's no harmony in a one man band
even god almighty needs a helping hand
please don't desert me now
there's no time and i can't fight another day
please don't desert me now
you've gotta show me mercy when i'm helpless 
show me mercy when i'm helpless
shine a light in the dark
hold me back when i get reckless
shine a light in the dark
stand me up if i get legless
shine a light in the dark
shine a light in the dark
shine a light in the dark

Ships Don't Disappear In The Night (Do They) 
Ships don't just disappear in the night
Do they?
People don't really die of fright
Do they?
We all know it just ain't so 
So don't be afraid when the table shakes
Don't you
Don't be amazed when your shadow quakes
Don't you
Start to pray they'll go away 
And then they can't do nothing to ya
They can't do nothing to ya
They just keep walking through ya 
Better be nice to Vincent Price 
Forces at work that we don't understand
Are they?
So don't get the shits if it touches your hand
Don't you
Poltergeists can be so nice 
Better be nice to Vincent Price 
What's that noise comin' up from the cellar?
What's it?
It's the restless bones of Boris and Bela
Boris and Bela
Don't go down, they're still around 
But then they can't do nothing to ya
They can't do nothing to ya
They just keep walking through ya 
And then they can't do nothin' to ya
They can't do nothin' to ya
They just keep walkin' through ya

Shock On The Tube (Don't Want Love) 
I was travelling home on the subway
When this vision got on at Maida Vale
And as I casually eyed the classifieds
She sat down next to me
Every head in the carriage was wondering
I replied with a smile on my face
And as I slipped into the arms of Morpheus
To daydream the rest of the way 
She was a smooth operator
You could see it in her dress
I said I'd like to see you later
But I didn't want to press 
I was homing like a scanner
Did a mental strip tease
But she knew that she was special
And she came on like a tease 
Don't want love
Just looking for happiness
Don't want love
Not looking for tenderness
Don't want love
Just looking for happiness
Don't want love 
She was a headstrong woman
With a demon in her blood
Through the window in her eyes
I saw fire in her soul
And I knew if I pursued it
My fingers would be burned
Like a moth round a candle
I was momentarily stunned 
Don't want love
Just looking for happiness
Don't want love
Not looking for tenderness
Don't want love
Just looking for happiness
Don't want love 
The carriage was spinning
We were up on the floor
She was whirling like a dervish
I was whirling like a fool
My reactions were dimming
Like an alcoholic haze
I could hear people clapping
I was stumbling in a daze
I was stumbling in a daze
My eyes tried to focus
I was suddenly aware
She was newborn naked
I was altogether bare
There were shouts all around us
There were clothes on the floor
As I tried to find my senses
I was sliding down the door 
Down a coal black tunnel
I was slipping away
Then I felt the water hit me
And I heard somebody say
Better get yourself together
This is the end of the line
When I looked for my woman
I'd been dreaming all the time 
Don't want love
Just looking for happiness
Don't want love
Not looking for tenderness
Don't want love
Just looking for happiness
Don't want love

Silly Love 
Hey toots, you put the life into living
You brought a sigh into sight
Ah hon, you make my legs turn to water
You bring the stars out at night
But they ain't half so bright
As your eyes 
Gee whiz, you take the beauty out of beautiful
You play the strings of my heart
Oh babe, you take the wonder out of wonderful
Oh my, oh my, and my, if you were mine
The rain would turn to sweet sweet wine 
Well he's been up all night
Breakin' his head in two to write
A little sonnet for his chickadee
But between you and me
I think its sssssssssssilly. Silly 
Ooh treas, you got a smile like a Rembrandt
Aha, you got the style of a queen
Oh dear, you are the petal of a rosebud
Next to you all the others could be weeds
You're the only one my garden needs 
Ooh, you know the art of conversation
Must be dying
Ooh, when a romance depends on
Cliches and toupees and threepes 
We're up to here with moonin' and junin'
If you want to sound sincere -
Don't rely on Crosby's croonin' -
Take a little time
Make up your own rhyme
Don't rely on mine
'Cos it's sssssssssilly - silly - silly - silly

Something Special 
stealing coins from the poor box
i'm robbing the blind, but you won't
understand, i'm a wanted man
got no choice in the matter
i'm mad as a hatter
but she makes me do
things i shouldn't do 
my baby wants the best of everything
i can't refuse her when she starts to sing
bring me something special
and i'll take you to heaven tonight 
going down to the street and
i'll pick on a pocket with a
healthy wad, from some wealthy sod
looking tough with a shooter
i'll stick up the bank
and take out, all that cash
i'll be, such a smash 
my baby needs the best of everything
lifes little luxuries to make her sing
bring me something special and i'll
take you to heaven tonight 
look at her face and i won't need to explain
this is the stuff dreams are made of
step in my shoes and you will feel no pain
she's got the power to knock your socks off 
my baby gets the best of everything
it's risky business but it makes her sing
bring me something special
and i'll, take you to heaven tonight 
bring me something special
and i'll, take you to heaven tonight

Somewhere In Hollywood 
Down on the casting couch
A star is gonna be born
A star with the stature of a Harlow
Who's doomed
And groomed to enrapture
All her co-stars, and stuntmen, the co-stars
Oh, let there be lights, action, sound
Lights, action, sound - Roll 'em! 
Out in the mezzanine
On the arm of a dumb marine
Her beauty looks out like a trailer
Norman Mailer
Waits to nail her
He's under the bed
And he's waiting for her to be dead
He's out on the patio
With his polaroid and scenario
And he's armed and he's dangerously.... 
Close was the weather
When I was a kid
She gave me a feather from her gown
To cool me down, to cool me down
And I was the galley slave
Who lost his heart when the ship went down 
Lights, action, sound
Roll 'em 
I had a part in the talkies
When you were a little girl
I've taken Lassie for walkies
When she was the pup that Vaudeville threw up
And destiny lead her
Hand in paw to somewhere
In Hollywood 
That's crazy, a dog up in Beverly Hills
Crazy, crazy 
La, la, la, la, la.... (You better lie low)

Strange Lover 
Baby Baby Baby don't hurry
You've got your finger on me
Don't let go, no no no
I know you love it
It's running through my veins
You drink me dry
You take so much of me
And when you touch me
I see the magic in your eyes
And I can't move (I'm going under)
One kiss, I know, that I'm with you
Forever  
Baby Baby don't make me worry
You only live for the night
It's not right, no no no
But in the morning
You seem to disappear
Here come the night
You seem to reappear
Is this a warning?
I've got a feeling you're not
Telling me the truth (you cast no shadow)
One kiss, I know, that I'm with you
Forever 
Strange Lover, pale as the moon
You've no shadow, no face in the mirror
No complection, no reflection 
Baby Baby Baby you're freezing
You send a shiver through me
I'm so cold, no no no
The day is dawning
We're moving underground
I must go with you
I start to realise
Your touch is deadly
I wanna look away
But I can't look away
I'm in your power and I'm lost

Survivor 
This boy he's a midnight driver
High roller and a soul survivor
She tried to send him on his way
He say, hey, I wanna stay
If you don't mind I'm hanging around 
This girl's on the road to nowhere
She wouldn't say but another day there
It's not the role she's decided to play
She say, hey, don't wanna stay
There's no reason for hanging around 
Take me where I wanna go running
Where the sea rushes up to the shore
It's a lonely place but I need the space
Want to let my feelings soar
Help me find the key to my prison
I've waited long enough to be free
I love you but I'm not really living
It's now how I want it to be 
Listen, I know what she's like she's just a dreamer
But I'll win in the end I'm a schemer
Give her time she'll be on the phone
She's never gonna make it alone
Better leave the door on the latch
She'll soon be hurrying home
Oh Mother, it looks like I'm in for stormy weather
So I'd better get my story together
Got to make it good she's no fool
I'll take her in my arms, I'll be cool
Don't want to get her upset
I wanna make her forget 
Take me where I wanna go running
Where the sea rushes up to the shore
It's a lonely place but I need the space
Want to let my feelings soar
Help me find the key to my prison
I've waited long enough to be free
I love you but I'm not really living
It's now how I want it to be 
This girl's she's a real survivor
She don't believe in the midnight driver
So she's starting a brand new day
She say, hey, don't wanna play
It had to stop, so I'm going away
I'm going away

Baby baby oh baby
I'd love to love you
But my hands are tied
Break these chains
Oh oh these chains that are killing me 
You don't need money if you've got love

Break these chains

Take these chains
Take these chains 
She never thought that I could live without her
All the little things she used to do
Then I fell in love with you
You found me
You took me in
When no one wanted me 
Making love on a sandy beach
The stars above us and we're clean out of reach
Of my chains
oh oh the chains that were killing me 
And you make everything a paradise
And paradise with you is twice as nice
Never change, never change what you're doing to me 
Never change

Take This Woman 
I found myself on my knees in prayer
The consequence of my deep despair
Now I must speak, get it off my chest
It ain't no joke and it ain't no jest 
Every night she would come to me
But her demands brought disharmony
I said, "You can't bring your drums to bed,
Your rhythm method's gonna leave me dead." 
Got to take this woman
Cos she's a whole lotta woman
Why don't you take this woman
Take this woman lock her away  
It would be churlish of me to complain
But caviar every night is insane
I'm fit to burst, I'm not in the mood
But she say, "Lie down babe, I wanna talk to you." 
Well I'm not fond of your family ties
The hangman's noose in your mother's eyes
You chatterbox like a talking head
Je ne comprends pas the words that you said 
Take this woman
Cos she's a whole lotta woman
Why don't you take this woman
Take this woman lock her away
Don't want to love you
I really tried
But I'm hook line and sinkered deeply fried
I've got to admit that with all your faults
We touch and it feels like a million volts 
Listen - I realised I'd made a big mistake
I'm only human for heaven's sake
Lord give me strength don't let me falter
I'm gonna take her to the alter 
And I'll take this woman
Cos she's a whole lotta woman
I'm gonna take this woman
Take this woman lock her away 
I'm gonna take this woman
Cos she's a whole lotta woman
I'm gonna take this woman
Take this woman lock her away

Don't want it to

Leave us alone we don't wanna go home
Put your chairs on the tables

Time to take your home
Time to say goodnight

Let's be together tonight
Let's be together tonight 
Taxi, call a taxi, yellow taxi, taxi taxi
Don't take the subway don't go that way

Gotta cross town back to my place
Pull the shades down screw the rat race

Hang the sign out don't disturb

The Anonymous Alcoholic 
You walk in the room
The folks are all there
With glasses in hand
But you can't take the band
So you head for the bar
The barman's well stocked
He knows where you're at
He offers a drink
But you can't take none of that
(No you can't take none of that) 
Everybody's having fun
So why be the one
Who's out in the cold
It's not good enough
You made a deal with yourself
You said you'd never take another drop
Your craving's big, your livers shot
You'd give a million for a solitary drop 
You take your first belt
It tastes like pure hell
The second one drops
Intentions are shot
Well you think you might as well
You take another sip
You get to likin' it
The music sounds hip
So you head for the floor
(So you head for the floor)
Yea yea yea yea yea 
Well you step out on the dance floor
And you grab at your boss's wife
You've been longing to hold her close
For the whole of your working life
And the band played on 
Move your ass 
Well your hostess is lookin' mad
As your hands start to wander
And your boss is gonna get you now
He's gonna put you six feet under
You get walked out the door
And your feet don't touch the floor
You're never gonna see 'em no more 
The dawn starts to break
Your heads a big ache
You're lyin' in bed
You're back from the dead
And your mouth feels like old leather

Never do it again

Everyone was havin' fun
But you were the one
Kicked out in the cold
You slept in your clothes
You let 'em down
Down at the club
You know your confidence got to take the rub
Your boss is sore
You've had your chance
He says he never wants to see you again
Don't wanna see you again
(Don't wanna see you again)

The Dean And I 
Hum drum days
And a hum drum ways 
Hey kids, let me tell you how I met your mom
We were dancin' and romancin' at the Senior Prom
It was no infatuation
But a gradual graduation
From a boy to a man
Let me tell you while I can
The soda pop came free 
Hey Sis, one kiss, and I was heaven bound
Now who would have guessed Milton's paradise lost could be found
But in the eyes of the Dean, his daughter
Was doin' what she shouldn'a oughta
But a man's gotta do
What a man's gotta do
The consequence should be
Church bells, three swells
The Dean, his daughter and me 
They were dating in the park
They were smooching in the dark
Of a doorway for two
She whispered "I love you -
Ooh, you know I never felt this way before
Ooh, you know the elevator in my heart
Has gone awol, awol, awol, awol"
And then I kissed her
And when I kissed her
It's a wonderful world
When you're rolling in kisses 
Now, the paint is peeling
(Hum drum days and hum drum ways)
Now, and when the chips are down
(Hum drum days and hum drum ways)
Now, you kinda lose all feeling
(Hum drum days and hum drum ways)
Now, your head goes round and round
(Hum drum days and hum drum ways)
Round and round and round and round and round
I'm throwing myself off this train 
Hum drum days
And a hum drum ways 
Hum drum days, he's got
Hum drum ways, oh boy 
Hey, you know I'm really earning now
My ship came in with a cargo of dollars
My name's lit up on the prow
It's a wonderful world
When you're rolling in dollars
Now!

The Film Of My Love 
Co-starring you
And co-starring me
Starring us both together
The film of my love 
Will travel the world
Forever and ever and ever
A back lot romance
A scripted affair
The screenplay a blessing from heaven
We're gone with the wind
On the Orient Express
To join the Magnificent Seven 
The film of my love
Will travel the world
And travel the whole world over
The film of my love
Will travel the world
Over and over and over
The film of my love
Will travel the world
Over and over and over
Over and over and over again
Over and over and over 
A close-up of yours
A long shot of mine
Superimposed together
I'll zoom in on you
With a love that is true
In cinemascope forever 
A clapper board kiss
There's an Oscar in this
A hit or a miss whatever
A box office wedding
A premier for two
We'll be on location forever 
When Pathe recall
The thrill of it all
They'll edit us both together
A legend a classic 
An epic of love
Captured on film forever
A lasting embrace
That time can't erase
Let them censor the wind
Or the weather
The film of my love 
Will conquer the world
Forever and ever and ever 
The film of my love
Will travel the world
And travel the whole world over
The film of my love
Will travel the world
Over and over and over
The film of my love
Will travel the world
Over and over and over
Over and over and over again
Over and over and over
Over and over and over

The Hospital Song 
Nobody sends me birthday cards
Nobody brings me flowers
I'm just here for operations
I've been out for hours 
When I come to I'll wet my bed
'Cos when I get mad I sink so low
As matron knows
I get off on what you give me, darling
I get off on what you give to me
Yeh, I get off on what you give me, darling
I get off on what you give to me 
And when I go to that seedy ward
Up in the sky
You'll be waiting
With a hypodermic needle
And a graph 
Here comes the dark
(I'm grateful for my anaesthetic)
Out goes the spark
(Delirious and apathetic) 
When I come to
I'll wet my bed
And when I get well
I'll take revenge
I'll wreak my wrath
On all blood donors
And their sisters
Visiting time and flowers
When sister brings that bedpan round
I'll piss like April showers 
I get off on what you give me, darling
I get off on what you give to me
Yeh, I get off on what you give me, darling
I get off on what you give to me 
And when I go
I'll die of plaster casting love

The Monkey And The Onion 
See the monkey peel the onion
See the monkey cry
He can feel his tears are flowin'
But he don't know why 
He continues peeling faster
'Til the onion is no more
Now at last his cryin's over
But all he had is gone
Whatever for 
You and I are always chasing
Wild ambitions and far off dreams
As we run in all directions
Nothing's quite the joy it seems 
If I tell you that I love you
Don't ask how much
And don't ask why
Have no doubt and ask no questions
Just believe it's not a lie 
Never take my love for granted
But never put it to the test
Like the monkey and his onion
Too much investigation
You know the rest 
You and I are always chasing
Wild ambitions and far off dreams
As we run in all directions
Nothing's quite the joy it seems 
On that we could be contented
With the good things that we've gained
But in the end we're empty handed
Just because we need the world explained

The Power Of Love 
Momma don't mind, cause your momma don't know
But if your poppa finds out that we're all alone
He's gonna change your mind and rearrange my bones 
Cause the power of love is like a tidal wave
It can pick you up and knock you on the floor
make you do the things you never done before 
Don't imagine that you're free
There's no escaping from reality
You're under the spell, under the power of love 
Turn the lights down low (lights down low)
And the hi fi high (hi fi high)
Put the lock on the door, pull the curtains too
Don't want the world to know, I'm getting close to you 
Well you never see it (never see it)
But you sure can feel it (sure can feel it)
And if you get the taste, you get the hunger pains
You'll be hooked for life, never be the same 
Everybody's gonna see
There's no escaping from the mystery
You're under the spell, under the power of love 
The power of love (power of love)
The power of love (power of love)
The power of love (power of love)
So you're sitting in a restaurant
And you feel so nonchalant
When the waiter says "what'll it be"
You start to speak, then suddenly
A pretty girl walks 'cross the floor
You ain't thinking 'bout food - no more 
'Cause the power of love is like a tidal wave
It can pick you up and knock you on the floor
make you do the things you never done before 
Don't imagine that you're free
There's no escaping from reality
You're under the spell, under the power of love 
The power of love (power of love)
The power of love (power of love)
The power of love (power of love)

The Second Sitting For The Last Supper 
Another fish head in the dustbin
Another loser in the queue for the soup kitchen
Another reason for a visit
We think you'd better come down 
Another nigger on the woodpile
Another honky on the dole
Another trip from off the 15th floor
The greatest story ever told
Was so wrong, so wrong 
'Cos you promised milk and honey
With an everlasting life
And we listened with our ears closed
And a blindness in our eyes
But we heard them as they nailed you
And we saw you crucified 
The second coming of the Holy Ghost
We need a pocketful of miracles
Two thousand years and he ain't shown yet
We kept his seat warm and the table set
The second sitting for the Last Supper 
Another Guru in the money
Another mantra in the mail
An easy way from rags to riches
God's little acre's up for sale 
The time is right for ressurection
We think you'd better come down
The church don't ring with hallelujahs
You haven't been for so long
So long, so long 
Two thousand years and he ain't shown yet
We kept his seat warm and the table set
The second sitting for the Last Supper

The Secret Life Of Henry 
Early morning
I'm still yawning
Kiss the children
See you tonight dear
Cheerio 
Henry's an angel when he closes the gate
But to the station he don't want to be late
His manner changes as he steps on the train
Beneath his bowler (hat) lies a schizophrenic brain
Oh he wants to flirt and Yes he's looking up the skirts 
He want to meddle with a body
He want to tamper with your mind
Sooner or later
He's gonna rip us his paper
He's gonna bring his fantasy
Out of the closet and into reality 
Henry's a devil when he get to this job
Won't take a break, he want to get to the top
No getting credit when the credit is due
He wants the glory and he'll crucify you 
Ten years, no promotion
Now he's gonna make them sit up (sit up)
He's been the brain behind the business
So, shut up (shut up)
And put your money where you mouth is 
Sooner or later
He's gonna take the computer
And take the information
He'll make a killing in the city
And they'll never, never, never ever know 
All alone
Sitting in his zanzibar
Dreamin' and schemin'
A plan of action but he won't get very far
Another skin-full 
Two more tequilas and he'll rule the world 
This is a rat-trap (mere existence)
He's really losing face (resistance)
I hear he's headin' for disaster
The fool will never beat the master now 
It's very late, he staggers back to the shop
There's something wrong if he's not back on the dot 
It's so astounding as he falls through the door 
He takes his lunch and passes out on the floor
Oh it's not his fashion
Usually keeps his passion hidden (hidden)
They'll never see him in the same way
Driven (driven)
He won't forget the things he did today 
Sooner or later
He's gonna rip us his paper
He's gonna bring his fantasy
Out of the closet and into reality 
Hello darlin'
How's your day been?
Can't complain dear
Same as usual

The Stars Didn't Show 
we came from miles around
just to listen to your sound
you made the night seem endless
you cast a magic spell
you played the part so well
your music blew away the darkness 
we loved you for better
we loved you for worse
but we never took you for granted
your lives were a blessing
but they carried a curse
the night that the stars didn't show 
you made me stand so proud
i was lifted from the crowd
the fire inside me burning
the figure dressed in black
sending shivers down my back
deep inside my soul was stirring 
we loved you for better
we loved you for worse
the sweet inspiration that you gave us
and i can remember we didn't rehearse
the night that the stars didn't show 
mountains may crumble
and worlds fall apart
lovers and friends may desert me
the road may be long
but i know in my heart
your spirit will always be with me 
the thrill to be up there
a sea of faces everywhere
i look i find you 
we loved you for better
we loved you for worse
but we never took you for granted
your lives were a blessing
but they carried a curse
the night that the stars didn't show 
we loved you for better
we loved you for worse

The Worst Band In The World 
It's one thing to know it but another to admit
We're the worst band in the world
But we don't give a.... 
If Garbo played guitar with Valentino on the drums
Then we'd be nothing more than a bunch of darma bums
So tune up, tune up 
Well we've never done a days work in our life
And our records sell in zillions
It irrigates my heart with greed
To know that you adore me
Up yours, up mine
But up everybody's that takes time -
But we're working on it
Working on it (Ooh) 
We never seen the van - leave it to the roadies -
Never met the roadies - leave them in the van
All because of circumstances way beyond control
We became the darlings of this thing called rock and roll, ooh 
Here I am a record on a jukebox
A little piece of plastic with a hole, ooh
Play me
Buy me and you play me then my plastic turns to gold 
Here we are together on your hi fi
A little piece of plastic with a hole, oh
Fade me, fade me, fade me, fade me.....

Things We Do For Love 
Too many broken hearts have fallen in the river
Too many lonely souls have drifted out to sea,
You lay your bets and then you pay the price
The things we do for love, the things we do for love. 
Communication is the problem to the answer
You've got her number and your hand is on the phone
The weather's turned and all the lines are down
The things we do for love, the things we do for love. 
Like walking in the rain and the snow
When there's nowhere to go
And you're feelin' like a part of you is dying
And you're looking for the answer in her eyes.
You think you're gonna break up
Then she says she wants to make up. 
Ooh you made me love you
Ooh you've got a way
Ooh you had me crawling up the wall. 
Like walking in the rain and the snow
When there's nowhere to go
And you're feelin' like a part of you is dying
And you're looking for the answer in her eyes.
You think you're gonna break up
Then she says she wants to make up. 
Ooh you made me love you
Ooh you've got a way
Ooh you had me crawling up the wall. 
A compromise would surely help the situation
Agree to disagree but disagree to part
When after all it's just a compromise of
The things we do for love, the things we do for love....

With your beauty you nearly blinded me
In your beauty I want to stay 
I bow to you with my heart
I think of you every day
When I dream you are there beside me
But when I waken you're far away 
Perfection, in miniature
With tiny hands, smiling eyes

Tomorrow's World Today 
I'll tell you something you oughta know
We came a long way from the radio
But what's wrong with that?
Baby's what's wrong with that? 
Now we got microchips, sci fi flicks
We got tomorrow's world today 
Now there's something that I gotta say
Do you remember only yesterday
We had Blue Suede Shoes
Yeh, and we had Howard Hughes 
Now we got holograms, CB hams
We got tomorrow's world today 
At a time when the world is changing
Faster than ever before
Don't lose sight of the human touch
'Cause we ain't seen nothing yet
Oh no, we ain't seen nothing yet, uh huh 
Now the children of the future
May take a trip to Mars
They might meet the Space Invaders on their way
'Cause we ain't seen nothing yet
Oh no, we ain't seen nothing yet, uh huh 
Wish I had a calculator when I was at school
I was a simple mathematical fool
But now all that's changed
Yeh, we got computer games 
And we got transplants, sperm banks
and body scanners
All there to help us survive
So we should think we're lucky
We got tomorrow's world today

Wall Street Shuffle 
Do the Wall Street shuffle
Hear the money rustle
Watch the greenbacks tumble
Feel the Sterling crumble 
You need a yen to make a mark
If you wanna make money
You need the luck to make a buck
If you wanna be Getty, Rothschild
You've gotta be cool on Wall Street 
You've gotta be cool on Wall Street
When your index is low
Dow Jones ain't got time for the bums
They wind up on skid row with holes in their pockets
They plead with you, buddy can you spare the dime
But you ain't got the time
Doin' the....
Doin' the.... 
Oh, Howard Hughes
Did your money make you better?
Are you waiting for the hour
When you can screw me?
'Cos you're big enough 
To do the Wall Street Shuffle
Let your money hustle
Bet you'd sell your mother
You can buy another 
Doin' the....
Doin' the.... 
You buy and sell
You wheel and deal
But you're living on instinct
You get a tip
You follow it
And you make a big killing 
On Wall Street

Welcome To The World 
You're through gestation so welcome to the world
We've still got vacancies just waiting to be filled
We're still delivering ten thousand souls a day
And disproportionately packing them away 
The starving of the multitudes and the feeding of the few
We're only humanoid there's nothing we can do
You must do something or we'll all go up in smoke
We'd like to help but we're afraid of losing votes 
They never listen to you
They never listen to your cries
We're not progressing we're only marking time
You're on your own 
Think of your children
Think of your children
Are they welcome to the world?  
If every Chinaman jumped up and down in sync
Then California would be sucked into the drink
You've all got bodies and a few of you got minds
We'd like to juse them but we never get the time 
Though man's achievements are a credit to us all
How come we're stading with our backs against the wall?
One thousand congressmen assemble every day
They'll send us packing on a dreadlock holiday 
They'll never listen to you
They'll never listen to your cries
They'll keep on talking and wasting precious time
You're on your own 
Think of your children
Think of your children
Look to your children
They're only children
Are they welcome to the world?

We've Heard It All Before 
Einstein, he said, nothings original
Find something new, That's easy for him to say
Took his whole life explaining his theory
Try squeezing your life into 3 minute songs like 
"My love, your face is a symphony
You play the strings of my heart
Say that we never shall part
If you say goodbye, then I'll surely die without you" 
Oh, we've heard it all before
Oh, we've heard it all before
Don't wanna hear it anymore
We've heard it, We've heard it (oy)
We've heard it, We've heard it (oy)
We've heard it, We've heard it (oy)
We've heard it, We've heard it (oy) 
We've come a long way from mono to stereo
Mozart would freak at the crap on the radio
Hits are produced by computer technology
Stick it in one end and it comes out the other 
"My love, your face is a symphony
You play the strings of my heart
Say that we never shall part
If you say goodbye, then I'll surely die without you" 
Oh, we've heard it all before
Oh, we've heard it all before

We've heard it, We've heard it (oy)
We've heard it, We've heard it (oy)
We've heard it, We've heard it (oy) 
You plug us in and we regurgitate the hits
Bombard your senses with sound of microchips
Program it digitally into the top five
Brainwash your ears, is it tape or is it live?...live, live, live.. 
Oh, we've heard it all before (We've heard it, we've heard it)

Why Did I Break Your Heart 
Inside my loneliness and sorting through the mess
I came across a bunch of snaps and letters
I found an eight by ten, taken God knows when
It took me back to when we found each other 
How did I let it start
If I could only remember
Oh, Oh, why did I break your heart 
The tender parts we played
I thought we had it made
The recipe for life, the perfect fusion
But when the love turned sour
I found the happy hour
But drinking for the world is no solution 
How did I let it start
If I could only remember
Oh, Oh, why did I break your heart
Can't we go back to the start
I needed someone to tell me
Why did I break your heart 
The cost of loving is a heavy burden
Somebody's gotta take the strain
The things we said would make a cover story
But who's gonna say
Who should take all the blame 
We analysed ourselves
It didn't really help
No one to referee, no rhyme no reason
I thought we had the best
But when you flew the nest
My heart decided it was open season 
How did I let it start
If I could only remember
Oh, Oh, why did I break your heart 
Can't we go back to the start
I needed someone to tell me
Oh, Oh, why did I break your heart
Why did I break your heart....

Woman In Love 
i don't know why it's the way of the world
but meanwhile.... 
you've seen her sway when she walks down the street
look at her eyes see the glow in her cheeks
it ain't no secret she can't hide it away
there's someone special she's the dish of the day 
she's a woman in love
she's a woman in her prime
(she's a woman in love)
look at her face it's a picture
she's a woman in love

this chemistry you'll never find in a book
no Ectochrome's gonna capture this look
these mixed emo's make your senses to reel
you've got to be there to feel what she feels 
she's a woman in love
she's a woman in her prime
(she's a woman in love)
look at her face it's a picture
she's a woman in love
she's a woman 
why should a woman in all innocence
be the one to inspire looks that kill
i don't know
i don't know why it's the way of the world
some will win, some will lose
but she can't tell 
this kind of beauty comes from within
shouldn't be allowed yeh it's really a sin
you'd sell your soul for a night in her bed
you're far too late boy I've already said 
she's a woman in love
she's a woman in her prime
(she's a woman in love)
look at her face it's a picture
she's a woman in love
she's a woman

Wonderland 
i wanna take a giant step
don't know where I'll end up yet
the devil or the deep blue sea
there's always someone watching over me
the power of communication
every little word's a big sensation
sitting in the palm of my hand
everyone at my command 
it's a wonderland
(and I've only just begun)
(but I get a smile from everyone)
it's a wonderland
(makes no difference, day or night)
('cos I won't go down without a fight) 
i'd like to introduce you to
a special substance, good for you
no physical dependency
for a star in its ascendancy
the world is a great big oyster
i'm riding through on a roller coaster
i'm looking at exotic places
but i'm colour blind to all these faces 
it's a wonderland
(and I've only just begun)
(but I get a smile from everyone)
it's a wonderland
(makes no difference, day or night)
('cos I won't go down without a fight) 
live while you can
everyday's a holiday
these are the golden years
and they won't be coming round again
so little time to be wild and free
so many things that you want to be
so little space between the cradle and the grave
but the minutes are ticking away
these are the special times
and they won't be coming round again woh oh woh 
people take me for a ride
but I'm feeling good inside
the consequence of love and pain
and I'm not the one who takes the blame
my head is on another planet
my thoughts are soothed
by the hands upon it
a simple trade in real affection
and I'm not alone in the twilight zone 
it's a wonderland
(and I've only just begun)
(but I get a smile from everyone)
it's a wonderland
(makes no difference, day or night)
('cos I won't go down without a fight) 
it's a wonderland
(and I've only just begun)
(but I get a smile from everyone)
it's a wonderland
(makes no difference, day or night)
('cos I won't go down without a fight) 
it's a wonderland....

Working Girls 
Working girls don't stand a chance
Typing pools are full deadly fish
Office Romeos believe
Dictation is the statutory dish 
Do they want you for your body
When you wanna use your mind
Every day it's hustle hustle
But you're not the pushy kind 
You worry and wonder when he calls you at five
You've got to work late will you get out alive
You know what he's after it's always the same
And soon you'll be playing the cat and mouse game 
Working girls they dress to kill
Posing for some glossy magazine
You know the flashman wants an exposure
But your momma says you gotta keep it clean 
Still you're selling with your body
And the camera never lies
Every shot is more revealing
As your inhibitions die 
He asks you to stay but you want to decline
He leers as he opens another bottle of wine
Don't want to offend him your ticket to fame
So you play by the rules
It's a cat and mouse game 
Working girls are lost in dreams
Buried in a paperback romance
Why don't you wake up to reality
And watch those fingers at the office dance 
When you're struggling with your figures
Is he studying your form?
There's a silence in the boardroom
It's the calm before the storm 
You wanna go home it's been a long day
The streets are so crowded and you must get away
You'll be back tomorrow
He'll call out your name
It's business as usual
The cat and mouse game 
Working girls
Working girls

Yes, I Am 
You never asked me to love you
I did it all by myself
You didn't make me no promises
You read my feelings so well 
[CHORUS]
Oh wow wow what you've done for me
Oh wow wow even a fool could see
Oh wow wow what you mean to me 
You didn't ask no questions
I wouldn't tell you no lies
I didn't need any answers
They were there in your eyes
Don't stop me from falling
I can't get enough
You took the pain from my body
Now I'm ready for love
Yes I am 
I've been alone in the shadows
Too many nights by myself
So many dreams have been shattered
You know the story so well 
[CHORUS]
I didn't see no fireworks
And the earth never moved
But when we're lying together
I've got nothing to prove
You gave me your kisses I can't get enough
You put the fire in my heart
And I'm ready for love
Yes I am 
People try to analyse
They worry is it right
But it really doesn't matter to me
There's no reason when you really fall in love
'Cause you can't stop it
Won't drop it
Don't even think about it
Hold on tight and never let it go 
[CHORUS]
You took the pain from my body
And I'm ready for love
You took the pain from my body
And I'm ready for love
Yes I am ready for love
Yes I am ready for love
Yes I am ready for love
Yes I am

You're Coming Home Again 
Baby, baby, don't you make a sound
All I'm asking of you is to understand
I can't let you go
When are you coming home again? 
It's so easy to be cold and proud
We should talk it over, we should shout it out
I can't let you go, no no no
When are you coming home again? 
I never dreamed that you would go away
When we had a quarrel we could find a way
But I woke up this morning and I knew it
You were gone 
It's no party when you realize
That you're on your own, nobody hears you cry
You can't believe it, oh baby
When are you coming home again? 
I've been foolish and I brought you down
But I'll make it better, won't you hold me close
I won't let you go, no no no
When you come home again 
I'm no poet, but I tell you so
You're the woman I care for, won't you ever know
I won't let you go, no no no
When you come home again 
I can feel that you'll be coming around
If I hold on to you, can we make it right
I love you so, baby
You're coming home again
You're coming home again
You're coming home again
You're coming home again

You've Got A Cold 
Your nose is runnin'
And your eyes are red
Your head is achin'
You'd be better in bed
From the bottom of your fever
To the throbbing in your toes
You've got a cold
You've got a cold 
You're searching madly
To find a cure
But the mercury's rising
To a hundred and four
You've got a beauty, a bad ass
The mother of them all
You've got a cold
You've got a cold 
Ain't no use in fightin' it
Get into bed and try to sweat it out 
Hot toddies won't help you
Warm blankets won't sweat it out
Inhalants just choke you
Hot flushes will tell you
Anyway you've got it
Ain't no doubt about it
Nothin' new about
You can scream and shout it 
Hot toddies won't help you
Warm blankets won't sweat it out
Inhalants just choke you
Hot flushes will tell you
Anyway you've got it
Ain't no doubt about it
Nothin' new about
You can't fight it 
Foreign bodies in your Kleenex
You've got no taste at all
While your system is dyin'
The bugs are havin' a ball
You've got a beauty, a bad ass
The mother of them all
You've got a cold
You've got a cold

Yvonne's The One 
When I first saw Yvonne, volcanoes erupted
And her laughter flowed into my life
She seemed so right, nothing wrong
Everything about her was so strong
So I waited for the magic to start
Somebody touch me deep in my heart 
Yvonne's the one I've been dreaming on
She said, "Hold on
You're not the only one"
And so I said, "You're wrong Yvonne" 
When I saw her again, I was caught in a landslide
But I didn't dare let it show
Her ruby lips were teasing me
But jealousy would never let us be
So I waited for the magic to start
But I know it's gonna tear us apart 
Yvonne's the one I've been dreaming on
She said, "Hold on
You're not the only one"
And so I said, "You're wrong Yvonne"  
She'll never know how much I loved her
I never got to tell
We never had the chance to say farewell 
When I last saw Yvonne
She was covered in roses
But the laughter had gone from her eyes
She walked so tall, looked so grand
Everything about her truly planned
But what you get is not what you see
"So long Yvonne you're not fooling me" 
Yvonne's the one I've been counting on
She said, "Hold on, you're not the only one"
And so I said, "So long Yvonne"

Awkward Silence 
Another night
Another fight
What could be so wrong (be so wrong)
I wish we'd seen us
What could be between us
All along
Could this be our last dance
This awkward silence
When I look in your eyes (look in your eyes)
I watch you drive out
After all we talked bout
Try not to cry
I thought I knew (I thought I knew)
But I felt for you (But i fell for you)
I should have known (I should have known)
That I outgrow  (I now have grown)
These feelings I feel, No longer want to hide
I wish you were here, But your by my side
I know whatever I do
I'll do it for you

Morning After 
woke up next to you this morning, 
and it seemed that without warning, 
i fell in love with you again. 
and when i leave your house today,
 i wish that i could find a way, so i could stay. 
so i'll just think of that night, 
when everything seemed right, 
you held me in your arms all night long.
 i listened to you breathe, 
i didn't want to leave,
 so instead i guess i'll write this song. 
it seems like this was meant to be, 
whenever you spend time with me. 
i wish you'd open your eyes,
 then maybe you'd see, just how much you really mean to me. so now i'll think of all the stupid things i do,
 the way i feel messed up whenever i see you,
 the way i feel inside, emotions i can't hide, 
i hope things always stay this way.
 and now i promise you, 
there's nothing i won't do, 
you know that i'll always love you. 
and now i promise you,
 there's nothing i won't do, 
you know that i'll always love you.

The Neverending Sentence 
How close did i come?
perhaps i'll never know
the journey is so long
i wonder where it goes
the clock is ticking down
until my car explodes
the bacon now is frying
7 cm from my nose
will i make it in time?
will it my life?
driving down this similar road
the half-connected story told
of things that can happen on the way
But obviously not today
How close did i get?
to where i wanted to be
was i nearly there
or did my windscreen decieve me
apparently you can get cars 
that can invent a landscape
on the screen in front of you
until you make the mistake
of trying to be
what you blatantly aren't
maybe next August i'll see......

Victoria 
started that day, 
on the beach and under stars. 
you took my hand, 
we walked down to the sand. 
and since you've left, 
everytime the sun has set since, 
i've closed my eyes, 
and wished that you were by myside tonight. 
and now i wish instead, 
i was back there in your bed, 
watching stars, staring in silence. 
and words i longed to hear, 
poured from your lips to my ears. 
you said yes and then we kissed. 
remember when, it was time to go back home? 
we said goodbye, you kissed me one last time.

1000 Shattered Dreams 
In front of mirrors
I wait to be seen
holding the hurt with one hand
you scream
(I could change
take this picture in my head
and rip it up in front of 
what is holding me back)
(Chorus)
1,000 Shattered Dreams
it drowns the fire of what could be
take your faults and cancel them out
'cause it's broken fix it, broken fix me....
Fist full of sand falling through my fingers
like life which once held so much love
but this jaded hatred is all I have
to wish for, wish for....
to break me down again
(Where is the shortcut
I'm feeling you
I wish I was feeling you
now.......)

A Walk Around Inside My Head 
Take a day
and walk around inside my head
but you can stay
as long as you want
until you feel pressured to say
whichever this and that's will fail without no play
If you want it 
you can have it
pressures there 
just go away
I really want you
but I can't have you
straighten your life out
do what you wanna
just go away
Everyday
just go away
Clock strikes 9
but upside down it's 6
and I hate time
cause when it's 6 it's 9 and this wasted trip
down the way
all these months of silence, silence
Can't you stay?
because it's never enough, 
it's never enough today
Stare at the sun
blinding your eyes
feeling, this feeling
this dying inside (4x)

Best Left Unsaid 
I'll wait for the skies to pour on me, for you
Don't ask me why
It's all the things we couldn't say
These lonely eyes
Leave me feeling far away from you
Am I asking a bit too much from you
Don't let me stand in the way of dreams you have
A perfect vision of worlds colliding slowly
Melting in the flames of fires warmly glowing
Don't ask me why

Leave me feeling far away from you

with you

Breeze knock me over and over again
Now I'm waiting for you
Just make your move
and knock me over now
Face up, clever grin

Contradictions (Tribute To Our Lady Peace 
I hid from all your contradictions
and found that they had won
I blame myself for all your lonely tears
we always fought
I never thought we would have to wait

I'm wrong

If I don't make it known that 
I've loved you all along 
just like the sunny days that 
we ignore because 
they're all dumb and jaded

what's wrong 
I fall around myself 
not blinking
but thinking I had lost
I blame myself for being too much like 
everybody else 
I never thought I would just 
bend this way 
then you spoke and made me realize

but when there's only one there's none and I'll still be a whore
Knowing if I left that I'd be right back here with you

You close your eyes to see,     me

The hurt is gonna leave
Until you don't know what you got,
At least that's what I tell myself
To get through today
But what tomorrow brings
Will leave me lost and cold again

It's what you put me through
You see I hate myself for you
For what you always put me through
I'd live this life again for you
So what else is new
I'd never love you the next time, you know how it starts
If this wasn't the last step, take me down at 3 am}
Every time I think of you it hurts to know you're right
But then I laugh to think how it could have been
If I played by your rules 
And wondered all through school

Hazy Moon 
What do you do when your life has become
the calm before the storm
when it leaves you feeling numb.
Then you try to find the answers
with only one question,
Where did the stars go?
What's the use in lying
when you're not true to yourself
and summer's way to soon
and I can see you cryin'
with your good book on the shelf
underneath a hazy moon
Why is it we find peace, in looking up at the sky
the clouds, the stars, the moon
will always try and pass us by
but we have to remember
to not float up there together
when what's important is down below, looking right back up at it...
What's the use in lying
when you're not true to yourself
and summer's way to soon
and I can see you cryin'
with your good book on the shelf
underneath a hazy moon
Trees will always fall, branches sometimes break
but here is where we'll be safe
sittin' on the deck we made.

Hope Is Over Rated 
The moon is rising now 
I can see it from a distance 
it comes up as i fall down 
reminds me of useless persistence then i look back 
and recall that time for that moment 
i truly believed you'd be mine 
maybe it was never meant to be 
but those few minutes were precious to me
I'm falling like a broken dream 
any reasons are unseen 
hope is over rated
I've said my prayers wished upon a star and nothing has come of this so far 
simply stated I'm here but you're there and nothing more will come of this today 
why were the times with you such bliss 
why did i have to reach for a kiss 
can i ask what i did wrong 
no answers as thoughts play through my head
I'm falling like a broken dream 
any reasons are unseen 
hope is over rated
Never thought it was doomed to fail 
it was acted well when it seemed that you cared 
alone on the beach as i stare along the shore without you is so bare 
why were the times with you such bliss 
why did i have to reach for a kiss 
can i ask what i did wrong 
no answers and thoughts play through my head
I'm falling like a broken dream 
any reasons are unseen 
hope is over rated
Relationships are gone like the sky 
the stars said good-bye and now the turn is mine 
now if you wont tell me why I'll know that it's a lie 
nothing is ever fine 
you're love was just a dark disguise 
the one that I despise 
its funny how time flies 
you'll always be just a girl who denies the fact she cries....

If You Only Knew (acoustic) 
Speaking is something, rather than nothing. Cooling nights with moonless beaches under our skies. Everything that can't be seen by anything less than gracious eyes. That certain something that shines out of you. Comes shining out of you.
If you knew. If you knew. What you do... All the steps of this trip. Don't regret saying goodnight, because  trying is worth the fight. When stars aren't out in the windows of our minds. Fear this and take no chances. Samantha if you only knew.
If you only knew... how many times I goto sleep with you in my mind. If you only knew... how much I need to hear your voice. If you only knew... how I wish I could touch you, forever in time. Problem's solved, out of touch but never out of time.
Did you know? Did you know? That this song was just a crutch, and the fear is over. All the steps of this trip. Don't regret saying goodnight, because trying's worth the fight. When stars aren't out in the windows of our minds. Fear this and take no chances. Samantha if you only knew.
Phone is ringing today louder and louder. (Phone is ringing) Life passed by yesterday like clouds unnoticed. (Life passed by) Heart beating faster tonight can't stand sleeping. (Heart beating faster) You smiling again in the corner of my eye, that look you gave me. (You smiling again)
Remember when we used to play out in the rain? Times were simpler than, but even if hard times lie ahead. Follow this song, if you only knew. If you only knew. if you only knew...............

Just Wait 
Sometimes in dreams
you seem so far away
but then there you are
smiling back like any other day
This could be crazy
but hey let's take a chance
what is there to lose
besides our hopes and the last dance
(1st) You just gotta let it come to you
hold it all in
wait till that precious moment
where it means more in the end
(2nd) Just wait
it will all come in time
Just wait
hold it all inside
Just wait
for what we feel right now
will prove to be great so
Just wait
till I can how you what I mean
You can't plan it out 
just be yourself
cause you know who you are
and it's better than everyone else
You can't tell me this ain't real
cause all i'm feeling is true
it isn't falling together now
but maybe soon

Knew But Now Know 
You left us
While I'm struggling with all our insecurities
and when the lights go out do you think of me
ten days will pass and then I'll start to breath again
because without you there's no me 
and evenknow you never went, part of me left
C'mon c'mon, phone isn't ringing
C'mon c'mon, clock isn't ticking
and when I say that I want you, know that I'm thinking
and futures to follow, your smile I'm screaming now
I never really knew, but now I do
It's midnight, it's midnight, it's midnight, it's 12:01
I hate the months that start without you
and please believe me if only once, I could tell you
your voice helps, it helps me get through the day
and what I needed to feel, I finally figured out
Now after sunrise it's your favorite day, (Thursday)
just do it one more time, please for me...ring, ring, ring
C'mon c'mon, phone isn't ringing
C'mon c'mon, clock isn't ticking
and when I say that I want you, know that I'm thinking
and futures to follow, your smile I'm screaming now
I never really knew, but now I do
It's midnight, it's midnight, it's midnight, it's 12:01
What if you only knew and someday were put together for us
then maybe you would realize what I'm talking about
and see that the truth between us can make a stone bleed
but if it got on you no matter what it would be my fault (my fault)
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Forgive me, I'm sorry
Just feel me, looking through you (6x)

Last Words 
As you leave me here
my heart tears inside
I can't stop you now
your walking down that line
with your head strait down
looking to your feet 
not looking back
for there's no words left to speak
You said I made myself
special without words
but how can that be true
when you give up
wow my heart would stop for you
Oh there are a million ways
to say "oh please stay"
but you'd still walk away
Somehow i feel left out 
not apart of your life
At least it is what you want
damn how it hurts inside
if I could only tell 
Sure I thought I knew you well 
Please tell me I am wrong
These are my Last words
that shall never speak
Repeat 1st verse..

Magic Happy Bouncy Ball 
A plane flies overhead

My fav'rite girl

Says what she wants 
When she's with me 
Well she's so smart 
And is her hair soft! 
And where she is 
That's where I'll be 
When she gets up in the morning 
And she turns open the blinds 
I tell her I like her t-shirt 
Then she says thanks because she is so kind 
One time we went to a movie 
One time we went to a show 
She is my friend and i love her 
Even when her parents tell me to go

My Left Handed Gun 
You made me cry today
from now on i'll never be the same
something clicked 
and made me see that you are just like the rest
not worth the chance
I'll now take what I get
and not take a second glance
(Chorus)
you want to give up 
you already have 
and i'm sitting here
with a gun in my left hand
the pain shoots through my body 
and finally when it's done
I cry
I cry 
for the damn world has won
It's such strong shit
I must speak in song
cause you don't understand
my spoken words
you don't want to listen
i'm worth it 
i'm only human
why the hell
does he come to see me
you don't even try 
nonnooooo
(Chorus)
you want to give up 
you already have 
and i'm sitting here
with a gun in my left hand
the pain shoots through my body 
and finally when it's done
I cry
I cry 
for the damn world has won
my left handed gun
my left handed gun
it wants to show you 
can it show you

Sleep, sleep, sleep keep sleeping

Never Leave 
tell me that you'll never leave, cuz you know I'm lost alone,
tell me that you'll never go, cuz you're breakin my heart, 
don't leave don't go. 
cuz everything is better with you than without you,
and anything is better than on my own again.
sometimes it's just so hard to take a chance, 
but just a second guess and it's to late, 
so many broken hearts along the way, 
another empty promise every day
do you care will it bother you, 
enough to make you stop and think, 
about the stupid things you say,
the lie's you tell and the game's you play
sometimes it's just so hard to take a chance, 
but just a second guess and it's to late, 
so many broken hearts along the way, 
another empty promise every day
i thought we'd last, until the end of time 
but know i see the truth in your eye's, and it breaks my heart, 
i'd rather die than to see that look in your eye's, in your eye's

Boy: "Hey, so what are you doing tonight?"
Girl: "Guess..."
Boy: "Really? Again?"
Girl: "Yea, it's what I do best"
Boy: "Always knew that"
Girl: "But always doubted..."
Can't you shoot me now, together I'm so lonely
Barred from you somehow, smooth until we fight...
ourselves... from killing this away from myself again
you're the queen of this panic and I'm due for punishment
so send your royal aggravations to sting me again
Boy: "If you fell, who would catch you?"
Girl: "Probably no one"
Boy: "I would, I'll never stop catching you"
Girl: "Why? All I do is cause you pain"
Boy: "Come here, feel what I feel"
Girl: "I'm scared"
Take this light, venture out into the world
you fell into night, so what if I need you sleeping
Just like always, sometimes least expectations are the plan
swallow my dreams, take the gun out of your left hand
So crash my head, forever we'll be
one to not be known
So crash my head, forever we'll be
one to not be known
So crash my head, forever we'll be
one to not be known
So crash my head, forever we'll be
one to not be known
Boy: "Hey, you still with me?"

October Skies 
Oh yea ya know it's true
it started out with you
at first we couldn't show
eachother what we know
All these things we see
so special, they could be
(Chorus)
So paint your signs up on my walls 
walking lonely down your halls
dim lights fade
but things will be just fine
'cause the sun sets in your eyes
underneath these October skies 
Lonely stares up at the moon
and you know what's killing me
your lips, your eyes
oh yea I need you soon

Waiting for this to be
while I make this one a memory
as I push down the gas 
and I'm goin' real fast
it all fades away

One Moment Caught In Time 
Soaking my head once again
to drown my fears until you said,
("Down the line but never crossed")
These silly games that we pretend
Another ocean made of friends
The harder we want to fall
the long we'll keep this going
I want, but can't see at all
our truth will just keep showing
The mirror
on the wall
me standing 
in front of it
and you're there
behind me
so softly
whispering this
and than we
could see
how great face 
to face could be
it could be......
One moment caught in time
is not enough 
to hold you here with me
in my mind
and in my life

Perfect 
I look at you there 
Oh, I wish I could stare 
And if I could I just would say 
That you're the reason I woke up today
Cuz now I know that you're the one for me 
Yeah, even if you don't know it just yet 
And now I know that you're the one for me 
Yeah, even if I can't show it just yet
I can see that you don't know 
Is it worth all my trying for you? 
If I could, I just would show 
That I'm all alone dying, 
waitin' and 
tryin' for you...
But you're perfect 
Yeah you're perfect 
But you're perfect 
You're too perfect
So perfect......
Distinction, rejection, affection... ahhh it's these things that make me true...
Devotion, compassion, perfection... ohhh it's the things that I see in you...

I'm begging' you please, just wait a little more

No one's to blame, but the time will come.

Pick Up My Ashes (Angels And Devils) 
Didn't you pretend to fall in love
and now the crisis is you're getting sick of me
Take this opener and stab 
through the letters of words I can't show you
me always asking myself 
Why don't you wanna see me tonight?
If I could only steal the sun and throw it at you
maybe then you will see the light
(chorus)
Constantly flooding my head with thoughts
of empty temptations that don't happen
Your words are a fire that's burning me to the ground
Always cleaning, why don't you pick me up like you used to
pick up my ashes, nap on me, hush, kill sound
So what if I want you
is it a sin to try and love you
forget taking what you get, in your heart you know the truth
and not having what you want should be killing you
So what if I need you
is it a sin to make you feel like you have never felt before
Just give this chance and take this touch
Feel this now and when it works you will know 
that avoiding me is not the answer, us... together is better 
nothing will ever come close
(chorus)
Constantly flooding my head with thoughts
of empty temptations that don't ever happen
Your words are flames that are burning me to the ground
Always cleaning, why won't you pick me up like you used to
pick up my ashes, nap on me, hush, kill sound
When you hold my face
my fingers through your hair
and then I'll always say I'll be there
with your warmth through cold
whisper to me
hold me tight, come on baby
and we all know something
tonight, tonight
just as long as we're outside
connection's made, one gazing stare
tonight's forever don't be scared
(2nd Chorus)
I know, I know-oo-woah-oo-woah-oo-woah-oo-woah
that you know, what we both know
and we now see, what we both know
angels... devils...
your angels

you fly me, fly me, fly me away
fly me away
please fly me 
fly me away

Poor You For Listening 
You 
You never were much fun 
You made me hide my eyes 
You hit me like the sun 
A life built on routine has replaced that of surprise 
And I've been feeling better since I turned away my eyes 
Ever since you left me, I felt like I was new 
And I haven't got much else to say to you 
Poor me 
Stick around and you will see 
Poor me 
Poor you for listening
All I ever want is morning 
All I ever get is night 
All I ever want is boring 
All I ever get is fright 
All I ever want is the doctor's office lollipop 
All I ever get is the tetanus shot 
All I ever want is the feeling that I'm over you 
All I ever get is not 
I 
I want an empty world 
I never had a friend 
I never had a girl 
All these things I've never had before, now I've got in spades 
And hearts, and clubs, and diamonds for fifty-two straight days 
As I step up to the table, I find I'm unprepared 
All I got is poker, all I want is solitaire
Now 
Now that we're apart 
The party never stops 
The boredom never starts 
I haven't time to breathe now, that's why my face is red 
As rings, and tones, and busy signals bounce about my head 
Savoring what's left of sleep as I am forced to rise 
And figuring I'm not missing much, fall back and close my eyes

Popular And Up A Tree 
There's no beginning to this song
There's no beginning to this song
I wish you stayed and now I'm going on
Yea, no beginning to this song
20 questions come and go 
true colors always show
but your just hurting them -
oh wait your hurting me (Grab my arm tighter)
I don't wanna move forward, I don't wanna move back
just stick in this single place in time
I promise, take cover
you ready? go
I promise, take cover
you ready? go
go.....
Take a step outside yourself it's cold
imperfection's just a stage
so play it over again now and see
what I could be, if I wanted to be
popular and up a tree
I promise, take cover
you ready? go
I promise, take cover
you ready? go
go.....
It's funny all I wanna hear
is bottomlines fly through my ears
and when there's nothing left to fear
there's bottomlines that end in tears
I promise, take cover
you ready? go
that end in tears
take cover

Red Light Before Regret 
Don't you waste another thought on me, please
wind blowing right through my fingers
and your eyes pierce when you look at me
I can't lie anymore
or hide this inside
you're so cold to me
and I'll always be colder than you are
Can't stand the chorus
Remember when we kissed under the moon
Can't stand this song, anymore
I must make you cry
you hurt me, no
another lie
I hurt myself, I hurt myself
Tear up my songs 
I really hate them, anything I have done
they could never tell anything
so just burn them
I never made you smile
I always bring you down
you know you'd be happier (so much happier)
with him
Can't stand the chorus
Remember when we kissed under the moon
Can't stand this song, anymore
I must make you cry
you hurt me, no
another lie
I hurt myself, I hurt myself
The music makes me die
staring at space through a car stereo
does nothing mean anything
just stop me,
just stop me before I make you cry
make you cry (4x)

Sleepy Eyes 
Diving in head first
is what you make me wanna do
Counting down the hours and minutes with you
When all is said and done
cause I want more and I need you
Phone was ringing, the phone is ringing
but now it's not (now it's not)
(Chorus)
I could never take (you in the place)
to take or ever face (wait wait I need you I need you)
you and I can't replace (Things will work out)2x
and you could never fake (These feelings feelings)
Things will work out (they will they will)
Things will work out (look in my eyes)
Once we can't run we will hide
Another dream last night
where we drove out to a beach
dive right in
and made-out under the stars
why can't you see
that bridges fall for me
and the scars on my back (remind me)
Sleepy eyes, look at me
sleepy eyes, c'mon 
look at me
Sleepy Eyes, look at me
You will see
Love inside of me until I die
fill up my sleepy eyes

Staring Right Back 
You know what I think
I think I'm gonna sink
sinking in your sun
I'll float up when I'm done
And when everything
all comes back to me
I'll still be right here
sinking in your sea
But maybe....
bombs could drop
then there's cops
I never want to go
but I can't have it stop
In due time is nothing 
but the middle is something
only not the top
(Chorus)
And I'll be there
to get in your face
when nothing seems to be there
and I'm there
to step in your way
when life ain't fair
You know this is not the way
lookin' right in front of you
hate the flavor, but love the taste
staring right back, right back
right back, right back
right back, right back
staring right back out at you

Steal My Flashlight 
Left alone and lost in the dark again
you steal my flashlight every chance you get
Once fallen memories when I lost your eyes, but now the candle's lit
Every day the same way (the same way) Please don't change (don't ever change)
Stop, rewind the tape -
play it back for me
all the things you ever said (all those things you ever said)
we're falling down on me
Stop, go back - 
and play it for me (please)
say some more
all the things saving me (saving me)
It's always night
when I look down empty streets
Where is the light
it's in you right in front of me
It's dark, I'm scared (Don't be a waste if you promise me)
It's dark, I'm scared (what do I do, what do I do)
Why steal the light that you put right back into
my light....
you put it right back into me

The Clock At Midnight 
The ticking gets louder
as it racks up with distance
but as you speak it goes faint
for you bring me out of reality
and into a dream
Hurt its my heart
when i must tell you its late
for now the clock is staring into me
i turn away 
never do i want to leave this place
for we created it 
you and me
It's hard to say good-bye
when all i want to do is talk all night
and fall away into a deep dream
Words are hard to speak 
it's midnight
all means so much
we could think of a million things 
but the time ticks on
The past goes ticking away
futher away in time
it grows fainter
into a dull whisper
you amaze me 
with you words
and the sound of your voice
i could listen forever
if it was my choice
how could i ever part
for the ticking goes on
along with the beating of my heart
which beats for you
and louder with every step.
I could talk all night
but it's midnight

The Five Alive Song 
I drink my Five Alive real slow 
Out of a striped blue bendy straw 
I like my Five Alive real cold 
And leave some time to let it thaw 
I've tried a lot of other drinks 
But nothing seemed to do the trick 
No juice could beat my Five Alive 
Unreal assorted fruit juice mix 
The other day I was at school 
Sipping my Five Alive, looking cool 
Bumped into you and spilled my juice 
All over you, felt like a fool 
But you just looked at me and smiled, 
"Hey baby, I like your style" 
You like Five Alive, and I like you 
You like Five Alive, and you're cool 
I like Five Alive, and you like me 
I want to have some after school with you 
You drink so fast it makes me sick 
You're my Five Alive sidekick 
Every day you cheer me up 
With Five Alive in a plastic cup 
You're my juiced-up sugarbaby 
If you asked me now, I might say maybe 
I want you to be 
My Five Alive lady 
Christmastime is coming 
Get your Five Alive 
It's gonna go fast so 
Don't be left behind 
La la la la la la la

The Princess And The Toad 
Could you ever wish upon the stars
and make them all come true
Ever really feel love surrounded in my arms?
my favorite color is blue
I sit, I'm longing and thinking am I sinking
in you?
and if I was, would it be bad?
if I wanted to, would you let me?
I felt I always held you back
oh why did God make you so sexy
(Chorus)
I'm wishing upon
every star up in the sky
I'm making stupid plans in my stupid head
You know the truth but do you pretend?
I want things I promise myself 
to someday happen
and actually last
Two heads
pulling me in both directions
everytime I see 
your face
and it's staring back at me (staring back at me)
I'll always be
(Chorus)
wishing upon
every star up in the sky
I'm making stupid plans in my stupid head
You know the truth but do you pretend?
I want things I promise myself 
to someday happen
and actually last
just last
promise me they'll last
In dreams I am happy
but my outlook is haunted with reality
Sweetpea do you want this?
baby do you want me?
no words, just show me
just nod yes or no
Cause you'll always be a princess and I'll always be the toad

Thursday Was Your Favorite Day 
Do you know, where everyone will go
if tomorrow always comes so slow
Look at me, look deep into my eyes
knowing everything is just alright
Things I like, things you do to me
make you know fine is the way they'll always be
Because, I just say...
Hey, do you want things to be this way?
Want me to go? Why can't I stay?
It was April but now it's May...
and Thursday was your favorite day...
Can you remember talkin' on the phone
everything about you feels like home
Wondering what to say next
cause I'll meet you on the steps
and see your pretty face
waiting in our special place
I just say...
Hey, do you want things to be this way?
Want me to go? Why can't I stay?

stop 
things will happen 
I can show you 
I can show you 
ecstasy
Trinity (3x)
Trinity will let you see
Sneak out 
and see me now 
you will know now 
that with me 
bad is the best thing you can be 
Fly away 
and get the hell out of here 
they gave up 
we're to strong for them 
so there's nothing there to stop us anymore 
hello goodbye 
nothing but eye to eye 
rumors of the hurt and lies 
Giving it up 
is not what makes me feel to free 
I'll never ever 
never ever 
never ever 
never ever 
no.........
Trinity (3x)
Trinity will let you see
just you and me
Goodnight I'm tired 
I'm tired goodnight 
Goodnight I'm tired 
I'm tired goodnight 
My heart can't stop 
It's racing all night 
Goodnight I'm tired 
I'm tired goodnight 
Goodnight I'm sorry 
I'm sorry goodnight 
Goodnight I'm sorry 
I'm sorry goodnight 
I'm trying, I'm feeling you 
although it's not right 
Goodnight I'm sorry 
I'm sorry goodnight 
Goodnight I love you 
I love you goodnight 
nothing tells this feeling 
this feeling inside 
together is better 
you make me feel alive 
together, nothing's better 
shhh turn out the lights 
Goodnight I love you 
I love you goodnight

Unlocking The Secrets Of The Summer Night 
Running into doors, unlocked memories
covered by the night
With no light left to see or wasted life to be
When it's over it's over, it's not and you care, the same
things not said to you. I fear, don't blame
things you never heard before, never said but always meant
Every word, Every night. Every word, Every night
(Chorus)
Spirits around us fly
smoke from the fire calling us
to be nothing more than we were never before
Unlocking the secrets of the summer night
If we ran fast enough, would we beat destiny
I can see you now, on the beach with the sun
I can see you now, in the water making 
choices made but never done
when you smile back at summer's love
and cry......and cry...... and cry......
The tears are showing and days are wasted
not unknowing but always tasted
(Chorus)
We'll find the key faster asleep
We'll find the key yea.
We'll find the key faster asleep
We'll find the key yea.
We'll find the key faster asleep
We'll find the key yea.
Dreams are real - ending now
Softly speaking
no sound

Unpublished Song 
Are you free? Answer, answer
or are you locked up waiting for me
Are you free? Answer, answer
or do you fight to hold the key
but when no one's praying for you
I am out looking for escapes
or ways
away
(Chorus)
Waiting, whining, lying, crying, trying, flying, dying
no no. stop, stop, stop
Waiting, whining, lying, crying, trying, flying, dying
no no. stop, stop, stop
We're waiting, I'm whining, they're lying, you're crying, 
no no. stop, stop, stop
Almost trying, always flying, never never never dying
I can hear you
Just scream louder
I can hear you
a little closer
fight your way
fight the step that's blocking you
(Chorus)
Waiting, whining, lying, crying, trying, flying, dying
no no. stop, stop, stop
Waiting, whining, lying, crying, trying, flying, dying
no no. stop, stop, stop
We're waiting, I'm whining, they're lying, you're crying, 
no no. stop, stop, stop
Almost trying, always flying, never never never dying
Are you free? Answer, answer
or are you locked up waiting for me
Are you free? Answer, answer
Cheat me down now

Weakness 
Well hey it's stupid, it's dumb
What else can I say
No I'm not
hiding what I really wanna say
Day in Day out
you really got me wondering
where we're going
and if it's our destination
(Chorus)
If i'm not saying what I really wanna say
you never know cause it might come out on any given day
For when I talk or look at you
my head takes a spin
Cause all I want is you
and it's my only weakness
For some reason 
I'm hiding around the corner
won't you come
looking a little farther
Sometimes it's hard
but we're only human
So let's stop
and think about what we're really doing
(Chorus) 2x

When Waves Hide 
Hey...
Remember when we snuck away
so we could be alone
On the sand when I wish you stayed
feels like home
yea...
and nobody, nobody, no one
could compare to your touch
it's all i've ever been wanting
like our every second was fading
I'd break the clock if time would stop
Last night driving home
past a beach I know
11:18... you, all you
11:18 I need you....
We could stand there forever
Music surrounding us
no sound that we can hear
but it's there, but it's there
just listen...
(talking)
I know, I....
still can't believe this
I know, I....
feel it when I hold you
hey, hey 
they're there
they know we're here
shhhhhh
just....
just crash

Your Back Pocket 
The calendar is finished
subtract one month then add one to it
and watch our new beginnings
one month away
with sixteen candles floating
If you'll just stay and shut them out
you will finally know all you want 
and again know me
(chorus)
Well they don't know you like I do
Let them say what they want
you know the truth and what's best for you
Without you this song means nothing
Without you this song is lost
Just hope one day these words will make it
from loneliness to your back pocket
All along knew I had what I couldn't go without 
All along knew I had what I couldn't go without 
I'll follow one page of worsts with your best yet
I'll follow one page of worsts and make your best yet
All along knew I had what I couldn't live without 
(chorus)
Well they don't know you like I do
Let them say what they want
you know the truth and what's best for you
Without you this song means nothing
Without you I am lost
Just hope one day these words will make it
from loneliness to your back pocket
And from notebooks to sneak-out nights
dreams of freedom week in your back pocket

All Cried Out 
[Allure]
All alone on a Sunday morning
Outside I see the rain is falling 
Inside I'm slowly dying 
But the rain will hide my crying, crying, crying
And you
Don't you know my tears will burn the pillow
Set this place on fire 
'Cause I'm tired of your lie
All I needed was a simple "Hello"
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear me cry
(I) I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure, 
My heart never knew such pain
(And you) You leave me so confused
Now I'm all cried out, over you.
[112]
Cryin' over you, yeah
Never wanted to see things your way,
Had to go astray
For why was I such a fool  (Why was I such a fool)
Now I see that the grass is greener
Is it too late for me to find my way home,
How could I be so wrong?
[Allure]
Leaving me all alone
Don't you know my tears will cause an inferno
Romance up in flames,
Why should I take the blame?
You were the one who left me neglected  (I'm so sorry baby)
Apology not accepted
Add me to the broken hearts you've collected
(I) I gave you all of me  (Gave you all of me)
How was I to know,
You would weaken so easily
(I) I don't know what to do  (I don't know what to do)
Now I'm all cried out  (All cried out)
Over you
(I) I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure,
My heart never knew such pain
And you
[112]
You left me so confused

Now I'm all cried out
Now I'm all cried out
Over you

An escalade, a Porsche
And a house on a hill
A platinum watch
Platinum rings
Platinum cards
A condo in Beverly Hills
And they say that
You're a millionaire
But baby I don't really care
'Cause I just want
For you to see that

To match ya boots
Versace wear, Chanel

Sexy eyes, sexy lips
Sexy feet, you got
Sex appeal

Wear your hair
The way you dress
And girl the way you
Make me feel
Makes me want
You more and more
You're everything
I'm lookin' for
And I just need for you
To see that
All I want is you
Baby I love your personality

A woman should be
Like picture out of a magazine
Or a vision from

Makes me want you

You're everything

And I just need for you
To see that all
I really want is you

Here we are all alone                                                      
You and me, 
Privacy                                                           
And we can do anything                                                        
Your fantasy                                                                  
I wanna make your dreams come true                                            
Can you hear?

Between your legs Loud and clear

[Chorus:]
We can make love on the bedroom floor                                     
Then on top of my waterbed 
I'm kissing you                                    
Running my fingers through your hair                                          
In the hallway 
Making love away beside the stairs                             
We can do it anywhere...                                                         
I can love you in the shower 
Both of our bodies dripping wet                  
On the patio we can make a night you won't forget                             
On the kitchen floor 
As I softly pull your hair                               
We can do it anywhere, anywhere...
I love the way your body feels                                                
On top of mine so take your  time                                             
We got a night                                                                
Girl, you know I like it slow                                                 
And I know you like it too, baby                                              
Please don't stop I feel it now

Ooh, you put me close to you

Z too hot to stop
So we goin' from the bedroom to the floor
Let you know a nigga miss you when out on tour
When our tongues touch
Have a playboy thinkin' much
Roll a Dutch, 
Let me tell you it turns me on
When 112 sing to you
What kinda feeling do it bring to you?
I pump hard till you say I'm being mean to you
I know the ice Roley gleam to you
A true playa's what I seem to you
And if you want it
We can do it in the Black 500
Wit' the top down
In overdrive when we ride cuz I'm hot now
You got me goin', 
I don't think I wanna stop now
Z feenin' like a criminal on lockdown
So let's get a way the ghetto way
You gettin' hot baby, please don't melt away
I got a crib on the beach Palmetto-way
And here's your personal key to see me everyday

[Chorus:]
Baby you can come see me,
Cuz I need you here with me,
And I'll show you what love is made of...
Later on if you are free,
Baby you can come see me,
And I'll show you what love is made of...

And I'm sitting here thinking of
How it felt when we first made love,
Oh I need that feeling again,
Nobody can compare, so...

And I'll go with you,
To this place that lovers dream of,
We can do anything, 
Sexy things,
And I'm here to let you know...

Thinking about the last time I held you,
And the smell of your sweet perfume, babe

To this place that lovers dream of,

How many things we can do, 
How many women in my life 
But yet I only love you, 
You're number one on my list, 
And I,

And girlfriend,

Damn, why did you give me space?
At a time when that girl was trying to holla ohh

Why'd did you have to stay?
Why was it too late for us?
[Chorus 2x]
[Verse 3]
Baby I should let it go
Or should I let her know
I got another on the side and she does everything right
I dont know what else to do, I'm not happy with you

And i dont ever want her ever to stop cause I love her so much

Do What You Gotta Do 
Sorry I lied to u
But I'm not sorry
That I fell deep
In love with her
So baby 
Do what u gotta do
I said I'm sorry I 
Lied to u
But I'm not sorry
That I fell deep
In love with her
So baby
Do what u gotta do
I was always on the phone in the bathroom
You were always in the kitchen at the sink
Girl I was always tryna find a way to tell you
I'm havin' relations and it's gettin' kinda deep
Now even though we've been together for a long time
Girl you know and I know things are not the same
Before we go on any longer wasting all this time
I gotta let you know I'm bout to make a change I'm...
Sorry I lied to u
But I'm not sorry
That I fell deep
In love with her
So baby 
Do what u gotta do
I said I'm sorry I 
Lied to u
But I'm not sorry
That I fell deep
In love with her
So baby
Do what u gotta do
You were always in the bedroom watchin' tv
I was always downstairs on the couch
While you were always undecided on a movie
I was always tryna get up out this house
And then I noticed how you always went to sleep
When it was 
time for you 
to give that a** to me
And then you wonder why a brotha wants to creep
Well it's time to let you know I got someone who feels me
Sorry I lied to u
But I'm not sorry
That I fell deep
In love with her
So baby 
Do what u gotta do
I said I'm sorry I 
Lied to u
But I'm not sorry
That I fell deep
In love with her
So baby
Do what u gotta do
Something's goin' on 
Something's goin' on where did we go wrong
What happened to the love I used to get at home
You be on my mind used to be my dime
Used to spend time talkin' on the phone
But now that things have changed 
I'm jumpin' in my range
And rollin' out
Sorry I lied to u
But I'm not sorry
That I fell deep
In love with her
So baby 
Do what u gotta do
I said I'm sorry I 
Lied to u
But I'm not sorry
That I fell deep
In love with her
So baby
Do what u gotta do

Everyday 
Everyday
Yah
Oh Oh, Everyday
This is the real right here
Things aint always what they seem
Check it
People look at us 
And say man they got it made
They signed a record deal
And now them boys is paid
But they don't know what comes along with it
With all the fame and the fortune there's still bull
Cause even though we struggled hard
And gave up everything just to make it this far
Some people love us, and
Other people hate us
But we gonna take the haters
Make them our motivators
Cause they don't 
Know what we've been through
And none of them could ever
Walk a mile in our shoes
And I got to keep it real
Every record deal aint a good record deal
But I'm a grown man so I didnt cry about it
Kept my head up, stayed strong
Until I got up out that contract
And I reminisce on what my lawyer use to say
But I wanted it so bad
I guess I had to learn the hard way
Everyday
Yah
[Chorus]
Everyday
The pressures of this game got us goin insane
If it aint one damn thing it's another thing
Everyday
The pressures of this game got us goin insane
If it aint one damn thing it's another thing
People wanna know 
What's goin on with one twelve
If they leave, if they leave
Are their records gonna sell
They say that he gave us the hits
Knowin damn well that we write our own sh
It's not that Im mad about it
But I gotta clear it up 
for those wonderin about it
I think you need to read the credits
Open up the cd dog and read the credits
Cause things aint always what they seem
So don't believe everything you see on t.v.
In the videos, I was in a Bentley
And that Bentley in it, belonged, to me
My earrings had to be at least 5 karrots
I had to live up to that superstar status
Stayed on the road
Had to stay doin shows
Even though I'm goin broke
I couldn't let nobody know
[Chorus]
People look at us and say 
How does it feel
On a new label
With a multi million dollar deal
I'm just glad we stayed together
We put our faith in the lord 
And he made things better
Cause he said it in his word
That one day your gonna get
What ya'll deserve
Wow
Now aren't ya glad we stayed together
Through the good and the bad times
We stayed together
Through the rich and the broke times
Through stormy weather
Andhey
Now we look back like
Don't you remember 
when you couldn't afford that boy
Hey
Sunroof top
Chillin by sea 
With a down south female
Like hey
How ya love that
24 inch rims
Big body Cadillac
Andhey
We do it like that
[Chorus]
Oh, ninety six to two thousand three
112 still keepin together
True friends all around the world
Our music gonna last forever
From ninety six to two thousand three
112 still keepin together
All we need is true friends all around the world
Our music gonna last forever
From ninety six to two thousand three
112 still keepin together
All we need is true friends all around the world
Our music gonna last forever
From ninety six to two thousand three
112 still keepin together
All we need is true friends all around the world
Our music gonna last forever
From ninety six to two thousand three
112 still keepin together
All we need is true friends all around the world
Our music gonna last forever
From ninety six to two thousand three
112 still keepin together
All we need is true friends all around the world
Our music gonna last forever

Living my life without you
Something I don't wanna do
So please don't walk away
And leave me all alone
Baby, stay for just a while
[Chorus:]
Why can't you stay with me
For just a while
Cuz if you leave
You'll take a piece of me
Why can't you stay
With me for just a while
Boy, you know you have the key to my heart
[112]
Oh baby, girl I don't want you to go
You are my heart and soul
The reason that I live
The one that I adore
And I can't stand the thought
Of being by myself
But I can't see myself
Loving no, nobody else

And when ever you need me girl
I'll be right by your side
I'll always love you
Who can love you
Why won't you stay with me awhile

Oh baby,

Got the funny feeling,

Everytime I try to kiss your lips, you turn away.

And I try to be strong, but I feel like you dont love me, 
Anymore...
[Chorus:]
Funny feelings,
Funny feelings,
That you don't love me anymore.

Waiting for it to ring.

But from you I never recieve a thing.
Well I try, to just go
By the things that you say.
But the things that you do,
They just tell me that you dont love me, 
Anymore...

Oh baby...

God Knows 
[Verse 1:]
Baby tell me why, why do you question
All this love that I have for you
If you look into my eyes you'll make an exception
I will show you love like no one before
Put your trust in me, allow me to be there
Baby give me your hand to hold
Cause the feelings that I have are so complicated
That words cannot explain there is only one who knows
[Chorus:]
Only God knows how much I love you
God sees my heart and that it cares about you
God knows that I'm thinking of you
And I'm longing for you, how I wish that you knew what God Knows
[Verse 2:]
Baby tell me what, what is the reason
One good reason you're so insecure
Cause after all that I have done
I think you should know by now
Girl I'm down for you and the love I have is pure
I wanna help you understand just how I feel for you
You're the one that I cant let go
Because the feeling that I have is so complicated
That words cannot explain there is only one who knows
[Chorus (2x):]
Only God knows how much I love you
God sees my heart and that it cares about you
God knows that I'm thinking of you
And I'm longing for you, how I wish that you knew what God Knows
And all of my lonely days, only God knows how lonely
And oh the sleepless nights baby, only God sees me cry
And everytime I think of you, only God can read my mind
God knows I tried to help you understand
And Heaven knows I miss you
Only God can see how much
Cause everytime you go away, I long for your touch
And when I say I love you girl, only God sees my heart
He sees my heart, only God knows
[Chorus:]
Only God knows how much I love you
God sees my heart and that it cares about you
God knows that I'm thinking of you
And I'm longing for you, how I wish that you knew what God Knows

Deep sea fishing in your favorite position
Everytime you moan I pay close attention
Flip em like a pancake
Show me something
Or we can break in your vibrating tongue ring
Lets mountain climb til we reach the peak
The technique will make u sweat 
But don't sweat the technique

I Can't Believe 
(feat. Faith Evans)
[Chorus:]
I can't believe that love has gone away from me
I can't believe that love has gone away
I can't believe that love has gone away from me
I can't believe that love has gone away
(I can't believe you've gone away)
[112]
Hours, days and nights I sat and I prayed
Never thought that I would see this day
I didn't think that it could hurt so bad
A broken heart was never meant for me
[Faith]
Lord, let it please rain on my face
So that it could wash away all my tears
If this is the house that love is in let me leave
Cuz I don't wanna be hurt like this again
I can't believe
[Chorus]
[112]
Many times I watched you while you were asleep
With thoughts of living life with only you
If I had read your mind and things could have changed
I'll give anything to be with you again
[112]
All I ever wanted was to see your face
And hear your pretty voice from day to day
Now that you've gone I have no reason for feeling that way
I can't believe you've gone away
[Chorus]
[112]
When I look back on the times we've shared
Our life was ok, now what else could come down
[Faith]
Don't you know you were my love (my only love)
And I can't believe that you've gone away

You're thick, body sick, got that trip
Keep this between you and me
You can get it any time you want
That's one thing you gotta know
[Chorus]
If I Hit
Promise
I ain't gotta hear nothing from ya
Yo nigger riding up with that drama

There ain't gonna be no drama
Tell you yet, 'cause I think I love 'em
'Cause you let me bend that over
If I Hit
[Verse 2]
Say it, don't flinch, let me shirt this flick
Wasn't you the one who said you love to drive stick
Now you wanna front like you're scared of it
When at the bar you started grabbing it
I already know how to handle you
Can do you
Before I put the hands on you
I'm a beat that thing
Like your man should do
But I don't want a repercussion when we do
[Hook]
When you stick, when we split ain't no hits

'Cause you let me bend that over
If I Hit
[Rap: T.I.]
The grey goose make you wanna get loose
Got your ass bent over in the new Benz coupe
'Cause the rims same colour as the ride and the roof
Or maybe cause your friend wanna ride with me too
Maybe it's the way a nigger shine in the suit
Or a fresh white tee whatever it might be
A neck like ro or a wrist like freeze
Rings like those, cufflinks like these
Baby you ain't never met a man like me
Turn a 9 to a 10 if you can excite me
Before I get one, but you get like 3
Gotta man well you know there's a chance you might cheat
Brothers gonna come up with plans to fight me
I'm only gonna tell 'em once I handle business like a G
You're running with the boldest cannon, I'm gonna pull
So before you take off you're panties
We should have an understanding
[Chorus]
If I Hit
Promise
I ain't gotta hear nothing from ya
Yo nigger riding up with that drama
Saying I done cut this woman
If I Hit
Promise
There ain't gonna be no drama
Tell you yet, 'cause I think I love 'em
'Cause you let me bend that over
If I Hit

What is this?
Numbers in your pocket
I remember when you
Used to throw those things away
Why do you wanna keep in touch now?
Who gave you a reason?
To act so shady
Baby you know
You can call me anytime
Anything you needed I would give it to you
Ooh, that's how much I care for you
You wanna act now
Never call me back now
Turning off your cell phone
Girl you know that ain't cool
Yes I don't understand baby yeah

 - Baby it's a shame we gotta go through this
We can't even talk
Girl we don't even kiss
I never would've thought
We'd be breaking up like this
But it's over now
It's over now
You think that I don't know what's going on
Cause you're always home alone
And I'm always out of town
You need to stop trying to play me
Cause you can't even fade me
I know you're messing around baby
Baby you know
You can call me anytime
Anything you needed I would give it to you
That's how much I care for you baby
You wanna act now
Never call me back now
Turning off your cell phone
Girl you know that ain't cool

[Repeat 1 (2x)]
Baby it's a shame
A shame that we go through
The things that we go through
When you're in love with me
And I'm in love with you
I think that we should talk about our problems
Instead of running away
Oh baby it's a shame

Forgot what love was all about
And the feelings we had from the start
My heart will always be with you, oh
Girl it's over

So baby hold on

Just a little while
Just a little while longer
Just a little while
I'm coming back to you
In a little while
For a little while longer
In a little while
I'm coming back
A thousand wasted tears
Our love's been strong for years
Your cry is not in vain
Cuz I understand
I'm trying to be the man
You loved when we began
Your cry is not alone
I'm crying too
You gotta hold on
[Chorus]
If only you knew my love
You wouldm't feel this way

Last To Know 
[verse 1]
Lately I have been questioning if what we have is lost 
I heard it in your voice when we were fighting
Tell me where it's gone?
Girl I thought that we could talk about whatever
Any problem that we had we'd always work it together
Did I say or is there something I've done wrong
Baby I should know, but I don't, still I wanna make it better
[chorus]
If something's hurting you then girl let me know
If it's me then baby tell me
You don't have to ignore, you don't want this anymore
Just don't let me be the last to know
[verse 2]
Honestly you got me torn and I'm so confused
Cause nowadays you got a new attitude
And you barely answer my calls and when I finally get through
You rush of the line like I don't matter to you
Was it something I said, girl what did I do
If there's a problem it ain't hard for us to work it out
There's no difference from what we've been through before
I can't move on and I won't until we make it better
[chorus]
If something's hurting you then girl let me know
If it's me then baby tell me
You don't have to ignore, you don't want this anymore
Just don't let me be the last to know
[bridge]
I never believed we go this far
Don't you let people tell what we have past

Girl I don't understand, stand the reason why, why you act this way
What did I do, tell me what the problem is
I don't wanna see, wanna see you leave
Wanna let you go, I just wanna find a way to work it out
We've been through so much, good and bad times
Girl I did you wrong, you forgave me then we tried to start over
I apologised tried to make it right, so many times
Now I think its time to let this go
[Chorus x2]
And even though I love you and you've been with me for so long
And we thought that we could make it work but we were wrong
But neither one of us wanna be the first to say goodbye
Baby I think its time to let this go
[Verse 2]
Girl it's hard for me to tell you that it's over
I hate feeling this way
But I know you know things just haven't been the same
We always said that we, we would tell the truth
No matter what it is, can't continue to pretend our heart is in it
I'm waiting for you to see, the reality
We at dead end, there no way to go unless we gonna to be just friends
I love you so much, never thought that I would ever have to say
That I think its time to let this go
[Chorus x2]
And even though I love you and you've been with me for so long
And we thought that we could make it work but we were wrong
But neither one of us wanna be the first to say goodbye
Baby I think its time to let this go

And we thought that we could make it work but we were wrong

Oh Babe

My My Sweet Babe
[Repeat 2X]

A man is important
In a scheme of things
He's the King of his castle
And the head of his household
And when you look at a man
You expect him to be a leader
This world belongs to a man
But there is someone else
That I can not leave out
She's the mother of the earth
With out a doubt
Even though were living in
[Chorus 2]
A man's world
Know your living in
A mans world
But it would be nothing
Without the touch from
A woman
[Repeat 2x : 2nd repeat ends in "Yeah" "Yeah" Yeah"]
[Verse 2]
A man is imperative
In the world we live
He's a father to his children
And the head of a nation
And when you look at a man
You expect him to be a provider
This world belongs to a man
But there is someone else
That I can not leave out
She's the mother of the earth
With out a doubt
Even though were living in
[Chorus 2]
A man's world
Know your living in
A mans world
But it would be nothing
Without the touch from
A woman
[Repeat 2x : 2nd repeat ends in "Yeah" "Yeah" Yeah"]
[Bridge]
Now tell me who's the King of his castle
And tell me who wears the pants around here
Whos a father to his children
A man like me
Now who would be the queen of the castle
Sitting beside you through the thick and the thin
She's the corner stone of this family
She's the mother of the earth
Even though she living in
[Chorus 2]
A man's world
Know your living in
A mans world
But it would be nothing
Without the touch from
A woman
[Repeat 2x : 2nd repeat ends in "Yeah" " Yeah" Yeah"]
[Chorus 1]
Oh Babe
Ah Darlin
Oh Babe
My My Sweet Babe

Missing You 
Sitting here thinking about you 
And all the things we used to do
I never thought that I would lose you
Cause you were always my boo
Sitting here wondering where we 
Wonderin where we went wrong 
Cause now I'm here all alone
Wishing you'd come back home, So tell me 
Why, why, why'd you have to go away 
Got me missing you everyday
Baby tell me why, why, why'd you have to go away 
Got me missing you everyday
Everyday I'm missing you 
I don't understand why you left, baby what didn't I do?
Wasn't I always there for you and wasn't I good to you?
How was I to know something was wrong, 
Baby I can't read minds
All you had to do was tell me
But you kept it all inside 
Tell me why, why, why'd you  have to go away got me missing you everyday
Baby, tell me why, why, why'd you have to go away got me missing you everyday

Girl I'll never find another, 
Another one to take your place
Cause you were so, so good to me baby 
And you kept the smile upon my face
And I'm on my bended knee and I'm crying, crying won't you come back to me
To me cause you mean the world to me
Why, why, why'd you have to go away got me missing you everyday

My Mistakes 
[Chorus]
If I could erase, everyone of my mistakes
Tell me would it make you wanna come over
And work this out with me
And now I'll do whatever it takes
Just meet me halfway
All I want is for you to come over
And work this out, work this out with me
[Verse 1]
Whats wrong with me
Why can't I do right
You promise me
You give me a life
If I could be
Well then just a typical 
Guy to lie to your face
How could I do
The things that I say I wouldn't do
Keep doing the same
I give you
Might just too pitiful
To recognize your worth
Now you tell me that before
Promise that I wouldn't go there no more
You gave me all of you
But what did I go do
And everytime I had the chance
To get into another nigga woman's pants
I would follow through
Not thinking of me and you
[Chorus]
If I could erase, everyone of my mistakes
Tell me would it make you wanna come over
And work this out with me
And now I'll do whatever it takes
Just meet me halfway
All I want is for you to come over
And work this out, work this out with me
[Verse 2]
As bad as I
Want you right here
I empathize with the way that you feel
Took away the thing
That you call your cute
If you could find the feeling you have from the start
You know we should never be apart
I'm asking you can you please listen to me
When you took me back before
I promise that I wouldn't go there no more
You gave me all of you
But what did I go do
And everytime I had the chance
To get into another nigga woman's pants
I would follow through
Without thinking of me and you
[2x Chorus]
If I could erase, everyone of my mistakes
Tell me would it make you wanna come over
And work this out with me
And now I'll do whatever it takes
Just meet me halfway
All I want is for you to come over
And work this out, work this out with me
[Bridge]
When they want you
come over and talk to me
I know I don't deserve to be a part
Of anyone tryna give me the heart
They loving me
Baby please
Come on over and talk to me
I see you like you've never seen him before
Cuz you're the only one to show me the love
[Repeat Chorus]
If I could erase, everyone of my mistakes
Tell me would it make you wanna come over
And work this out with me
And now I'll do whatever it takes
Just meet me halfway
All I want is for you to come over
And work this out, work this out with me

Never mind that he don't care

Say it's alright and I'll be there

Shoulda never let him call you, baby
No matter how I try
No longer can I hide

Nowhere 
If ever you wondered
If ever you were nervous about it
You gotta know,
I aint never,
Lemme say that again,
I aint never, goin nowhere
Listen to me
Last night I allmost cried when you told me 
That you think you love me more than I love you
Sometimes it hurts to carry that burden alone
Lets be clear and get a few things straight
No ones ever gunna take your place in my heart
Nothing can measure the love that i've got for you
Im telling you
When im out in the club at night
You dont have to worry about a thing
Cuz I aint goin nowhere, I aint goin nowhere,
So my heart is telling me that you are the one
that im gon be with for the rest of my life
And I aint goin nowhere
I know you've heard it all before
You dont have to worry no more
Cuz I aint goin nowhere
Baby just trust me
As long as you love me
I aint never goin nowhere
I was lost and abandoned
Searching for the truth
Looking for that missing one
That missing one was you
The road was so tough
But you gave it up
Untill I found you and you made it 
Worth the wait and worth the years
Worth the strength and worth the tears
And you dont know the half of it
But baby heres the rest of it
Did you know that  your a gift far brighter than the sun?
Did you know that your a blessing, and im the lucky one
Did you know that I could never ask for a better love
Did you know that I would die, before I broke your heart
Did you know that if you left me, my world would fall apart
And never come back together, baby thats for real
So the next time that you tell me, you'll remember this
When im out in the club at night
You dont have to worry about a thing
Cuz I aint goin nowhere, I aint goin nowhere,
So my heart is telling me that you are the one
that im gon be with for the rest of my life
And I aint goin nowhere
I know you've heard it all before
You dont have to worry no more
Cuz I aint goin nowhere
Baby just trust me
As long as you love me
I aint never goin nowhere
When im out in the club at night
You dont have to worry about a thing
Cuz I aint goin nowhere, I aint goin nowhere,
So my heart is telling me that you are the one
that im gon be with for the rest of my life
And I aint goin nowhere
I know you've heard it all before
You dont have to worry no more
Cuz I aint goin nowhere
Baby just trust me
As long as you love me
I aint never goin nowhere

Now That We're Done 
Got to try my best to reach the lowest low
To a place where no one goes
If you let me taste your soul
I'd let you taste my funky emotions
And I'll cover you with me
In a pool of ecstasy
There's no place I'd rather be
Then with you
Please let me do you again
[Chorus:]
Now that we're done, what are you thinkin'
Body's so soft, just can't stop thinkin'
You touch me there, what are you thinkin', ooh
Now that we're done, what are you thinkin'
Body's so soft, just can't stop thinkin'
Here comes the sun, now what are you thinkin', ooh
Lying here on a bed full of trust
Just don't fully cover the lust
Anticipating on the questions I'll ask
Was I strong enough or will I last, I don't know
It's kinda hard to play this right
These feelings that I have inside
Is something that I just can't, can't hide
[Chorus 2x]
Do it again
Can't believe how this feels
The feeling is unreal
I got to know now that we're done
Now that we're done, what are you thinkin'
Can we do it again and again and again and agian
112 won't you help me sing it

Palm trees, 
Cats lay in Pablo,
In milked out diablos, 
The Williest, 
Bitches be the silliest, 
The more I smoke, 
The smaller the phillie gets, 
Room 112 where the players dwell, 
To stash more cash than Burn and Hale, 
Inhale, 
Make you feel good like Tony Toni Tone (feels good), 
Dig up in your middle like Monie (yeah), 
Don't know me,
But your settin up to blow me, 
Try to style, 
Fly up north with a homie (yes),
It's style is dondatta, 
Playas stay splurgin',
Game so tight,
They call it virgin...
[112]
Oh I need to know,
Where we stand,
Do we share this special thing called love,
I know I do, 
What about you,
I just can't get enough of the time...
I need you in my life,
Where do we go,
What do I do,
I can't live without your love,
Thinkin' of you,
Makes me feel,
Like I am the only one for you,
[Chorus:]
Girl I want to be with you,
No one else, 
Only you,
Why can't we just,
Make it happen,
Baby, I need you in my life...
Every time I'm with you,
Never want it to come to an end (thought I told you that we won't stop),
You always make me so happy,
You'll always have a place in my heart...
I need you in my life,
Where do we go,
What do I do,
I can't live without your love,
Thinkin' of you,
Makes me feel,
Like I am the only one for you,
[Mase]
Now you can hum all you want to, 
Cum all you want to, 
Money I'mma front you, 
Girl I wanna flaunt you, 
I'mma always want you, 
When nobody want you, 
If I die now my love will still haunt you, 
Mase ain't the one that will pay for your phone, 
Mase be the one that will take you home,
Even though I'm not the one that gave you the stone, 
All your nights alone,
I could make you moan, 
Everybody know I got more bounce than the ounce, 
Bad Boy get more money than you can count, 
Why I'm buying things you can't even pronounce, 
I'd do it to your cat for a large amount,
And when the beef come you know where to be found, 
Why I be around till the winner is announced (the winner is), 
So there ya go girl with thousands in ya palms,
Why you can't let by gones be by gones...

Where do I go,
What must I do,
If I can't live without your love,
Thinkin' of you, makes me feel, baby,

Player 
I'm a player..... girl I thought you knew
When you started messin around with me, knew I wouldn't commit to you
Cause I'm a player...... and I know you can't see it in my eyes......
Everyone says that I'm innocent, and it should come as no surprise....
That I'm a player........... and I really think you need to know
That I can't love you right now baby, 'cause I need more time to grow.......
But when I do get ready to settle down....
Baby the first one I'm calling is you
Oh....... when I do get ready to settle down,
Baby the first one I'm calling is you
But until then.........
I'm a player, and I've traveled all around the world,
I've broken many hearts, and it really hurts to say this to you girl
But I'm a player........ and it's kinda sad that it has to be this way,
But I don't wanna lock you down until I'm ready, so right now, I'm gonna play......
But when I do get ready to settle down....
Baby the first one I'm calling is you
Oh....... when I do get ready to settle down,

But until then.........

Pleasure And Pain 
You always said you loved me
Though my mind's right now not sure
You've always been there for me
Though my heart never feels secure
Why can't you take a further step
To let me know you really care
Cuz now I'm feeling driven
Into a love that's not right there
[Chorus:]
Why do you make me feel this way
Feeling betrayed, feeling pushed away
Why do you make me feel so bad
Feeling so hurt, feeling so sad
What have I done to make you turn
I'm feeling so lost, I'm feeling so burned
If you really cared you'd make a change
So I could feel the pleasure and not the pain
After all I've said
You still have it set in your head
That you don't really care about me
Why can't you seem to believe
That I'm the only one for you
I gave all my love to you
And after all I've done for you
You never say that you love me
The way that I love you
[Chorus]
I feel all the pain, hurt so bad, feel so sad
It hurts so bad, it hurts so bad
I just can't take no more baby
Girl make a change
So I can feel the pleasure and not the pain

Just give me one chance
To prove to you I'm a better man
Never break apart
You'll always be in my heart
Whatever he won't do
You know I'd do it for you
[Chorus]
I'll do things for you
Like that man won't do
I'll prove my love to you
Girl I'll die for you
I'll hold you tight
All through the night
To let you know
It'll be alright
You are my world
Please be my girl
I promise you
My love is true
I'll make love to you
I'll take care of you
Girl I'm gonna show you that Im
Right here for you
[Chorus X2]
Oh Baby
Be Right There for You

Say Yes 
[Verse 1]
Girl you had my attention
From the first time
I laid eyes on you
And ever since that moment
I wanted to be
Be the one for you
And I know its hard
'cause you've been scarred
But baby let me heal that wound
And I know that you've heard
All this before
But there's a different man
At your door
[Chorus:]
Why don't we just run away
We can take a trip, leave today
All I need is for you to just
Say yes
You don't have to bring a thing
Don't worry 'bout that
It's all on me
All I need is for you to just
Say yes
[Verse 2]
Might be crazy but I know that
You want it just as bad
Now you've finally got a reason
To leave that pain in the past
'cause we can
Go wherever you want to
Do whatever you like
Ooh let me show you babe
The kind of real man
That you been missing
[Chorus 2x]
Ohhhhhhh
Ohhhhhhh
Ohhhhhhh
This is what I need from you
Don't you worry 'bout a thing

Slip Away 
Baby
I wish you had recognized
The love I had for you
When it was in my heart
And when it was there for you
Because now
You're coming back to me
And you recognize the love that was once there
But I found somebody else
It's too lateIm sorry
You should have known that I loved you
You should have seen it in my eyes
Should have allowed yourself to 
Believe in love, and recognize
That my love, it wasn't going nowhere
Noone but you was in my heart
And I can't believe that you would push your love aside
Baby
[Chorus]
It's too bad
You missed out on me 
And it's so sad
Sad that you're gone away
And I'm sorry
That you missed out on me
But it's too late
You let my love slip away
And you should have known that I was open
You should have seen it in my smile
Should have allowed yourself to be adult, instead of a child
But you are the one with insecurities
You tried to put the blame on me
You never knew that my love was really here to stay
And now it is
[Chorus]
Baby tell me how
Baby how could you
Let our, love, fade away
But you never knew 
I cared for you, and that I loved you
And you never, gave me
Your everything
This love was not for you
And Baby
[Chorus x2]
You should have known that I loved you
You should have seen it in my eyes
So sorry, but you let my love slip away
You should have known that I was open
You should have seen it in my smile
So sorry, but

Smile 
Another night and it seems that 
You made you cry yourself to sleep
Reminiscing on how it began
You found pleasure in this man
And you fell like an autumn leaf
for his lies now you wanna leave
Give me just one chance 
Cause I believe that I can make you smile
I know a thousand times
You sat alone and cried
You don't deserve it
Cause I believe that I can make you smile
Tranquillity the misery 
Any day will it ever cease?
Here's my shoulder it's okay to cry
Cause I know how make it right
Cause you feel like you wanna leave
For his life now you won't lead
Baby give me one chance
Cause I believe that I can make you smile
I know a thousand times
You sat alone and cry
You don't deserve it 
Cause I believe that I can make you smile
Whoaa

Someone To Hold 
Sometimes I stare at the bed
Knowing that no one's there
Something is telling me
That you feel the way I do
I dream of you all the time
Wishing that you were mine
I'm feeling so empty
Hoping you'll think of me
I need ya here tonight
[Chorus:]
If I'm all alone
And you're all alone
Ain't nothing wrong
Having someone to hold
Oh, your tender touch
It means so much
It feels so right having someone to hold
It's very plain to see
I want you next to me
Give me your hand and
I'll try to understand
Girl I love you so
I can't let you go
Ain't nothing wrong with having someone to hold
Every now and then
I get to wondering
Are you with someone else
Or could you be by yourself
I turn on the TV
It's a picture of you and me
And I'm going crazy
Cuz I miss my baby
I want you here tonight, tonight
[Chorus]
Baby, I love you so
And everything that you have done for me
No one has ever done before
And I'll never let you go
You mean the world to me
And baby the way you make me feel
Whenever I'm alone with you
Is irreplaceable
(Girl, there ain't nothing wrong so)

That's How Close We Are 
Na na na 
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na
Without the root, you ain't got no tree
And without the branches, you aint got no leaves
To understand her is to understand me
Cause thats how close we are
Without a sea you ain't got no air
And it ain't no walkin if you aint got the legs
Understand i use them eyes to see
That's how close we are
[chorus]
Heart to heart
Breath to breath
She fills me up til there aint none left
No space, no time
Her spirits my mind
You see, that's how close we are
Thats how close we are 
[x2]
Without the stars, there's no galaxy
And without the river, you dont have no sea
Just look at my life, and its her you'll see
Cause thats how close we are
And without a voice no one can hear you sing
And it ain't no flying without the wings
So if you see me flying
It's her carrying me
That's how close we are
[chorus]
[breakdown]
She talks with me
She walks with me
She's holding me
And yes, shes teaching me
Everything i can't do 
Everything i can't say
She does for me
She prays with me
She cries with me
She's loving me
Nothing could compare to the love we share
So that woman and man
Who understands
You can say:
Heart to heart
Breath to breath
She fills me up til there ain't none left
No space, no time
Her spirits my mind
You see, that's how close we are
Thats how close we are

The Only One 
(feat. Lil' Kim)
[Lil Kim]
Catch me in the spot, low C's in the drop
About half and ounce, the size of Zip-lock
Knockin' the new One-one-deuce
I wanna (intro)deuce me and my old flame
And his name is Bruce
But blew my eye when his girl drove by
Told me bye then he winked his eye
I'm too Don fo' this, too fly to curse
Threw his jacket out first then BAM! Hit reverse
[112]
Oh, baby
You need to know
I've been in love
And I've never known love like this
I need to know
Just how you feel
Let me know if this love is real
I'm tired of wasting time on you
So tell me what you wanna do
Is it another man holding your hand?
Why is this a mystery?
Oh, baby can't you see?
Girl, you're the only one I'll ever want
The only one I'll ever need
[repeat]
Oh, baby I think it's time for us to grow
We've been friends now for far too long
The way you kiss, it turns me on
Let me know if you feel this strong
[Chorus]
Give me your love
Don't you know that I, I need your love
I need you here in my life, baby (everyday)
Baby, please, I'll take good care
I'll take care of your needs
I need you here with me
[Lil' Kim]
Pretend like we friends
And do our own thing (c'mon)
We can chitty-bang-bang
But let the phone ring (I like this)
From the first night, knew you wasn't true
Ex-girl came through, she said she miss you (uh, huh)
Panties in the bathroom sink, hot pink (hot pink)
What's a girl like me supposed to think? (c'mon)
I'm a Bad Girl (Bad Girl)
You shady? I get shady (shady)
To up your old lady and proposing us to stay still friends

This is the time where you all should report to the dance floor

J.D. plus 112 add that up
Now, that equals me seein' you in see-through
Now, whatever the chain go I let the bottle of three do
Jeans by E-vesal check out the Vs too
A roof free coup do you like what you see boo (You like what you see)

Shawty think she a dime
Me on her mind, sure to be some sexin' goin' on, talkin' reckless on the phone, she be naked waitin' home
Soon as I undress it's on
She be screamin' Jermaine till six in the mornin'
[Verse 1]
Girl I need to see you right away
There's somethin' one my mind about you and I that I gotta say oh baby
Lately we been talkin' on the two way
About what you like about what I like
And I think it's about time we do somethin' about it at home
[Bridge]
It's been so long, since 
You had a man in your life
And weather you know it or not
You need someone to touch that spot that you love
And baby I'm willin' to give you what you've been missin'
Don't tell my girl
Don't tell my girl about it

Baby I want you
Would you freak me
Would you freak me in the way
The way that I freak you

Baby I freak you

[Verse 2]
I used to want you so bad years ago
No the feelin's come back
Baby infact, it's alittle bit stronger than before
Is it wrong if I touch ya
Where your man didn't touch ya
'Cause he had ya baby
Don't say no baby
Just let me have my way with you
[Bridge]
Been so long since you
Had a man in you life
Weather you know it or not 
You need someone to touch that spot

Tell a ball player dude he can slide on true
Check one, one two, come on
Check one, one two (Once again it's on)
[Chorus to fade: 112 with various ad-libs]

Unbelievable 
This is a DPS production
Give me a beat.

I'm gonna have some fun tonight
Lookin for a girl tonight
Lookin for a perfect per-son-ality
And she gotta have a freaky side
I wanna know
If you are curious
Then I wanna get serious
If you are feelin this
Then this is what I need
Girl let me be your everything
Baby all that you need and more
Shakin off all this drama in my life
Girl I'm kickin it at the door
I wanna know
If you are curious
Then I wanna get serious
If you are feelin this
Then come to me, so unbelievable
[Chorus]
So unbelievable
Your love is incredible
If you're available (girl this is what I need)
Then just let me know
So, So unbelievable
Your love in incredible
If you're available

And you know that I like it slow
I wanna know
If you are curious
Then I wanna get serious
If you are feelin this
Then this is what I need
Gonna make your dreams come true tonight
Cause baby I'm feelin you
We can do just what you want, just what you like
Cause it's all about me and you
I wanna know
If you are curious
Then I wanna get serious
If you are feelin this
Then come to me, so unbelievable
[Chorus X2]
The dambdest thing
I wanna buy you all the finest things
Big house in the hills
Supersize your rings
My mind's on my money 
And my money's on my mind
Get you up out of the ghetto
I just want you to shine
So don't be telling your girls my money dont stretch
And don't be sayin that 112 dont make hits
Cause you know I moved up
>From the 5 to the six
When I shift with the radio
I know they gonna like this
Sayin Def Jam is like sayin no stress man
Tv's and champaign in the stretch Lex man
Pour a glass for yourself and pass it to the next man
Takin trips from Atlanta to the Kamen Islands
Forget your problems, lay back, catch a tan
You know we livin it up, chillin in the sand
Catch me off in the club, spend a couple grand
It's Un-be-live-a-ble
[Chorus X4]

We Goin' Be Alright 
I would walk, I would walk, I would walk
A thousand miles, if I knew that you
Would be waiting on the other side
I would climb, I would climb, I would climb
The highest mountain,
If you would fulfil the promise to be mine oh mine
I would swim, the seven seas
If we could sit down and talk about us
And agree to agree
I would walk without water 
Across the death of sand 
To here you say you're ready to be in love again
People are talking, trying to build us apart
They can't see the love in our hearts
Girl I care about you and you care about me
And if we believe in each other
We goin' be alright, yes we will
We goin' be alright, alright
We goin' be alright, yes we will
If we believe in each other
We goin' be alright, alright!

Whatcha Gonna Do 
(feat. MJG)
You tell me you're keepin' it real with me
You tell me that I'm the only one
You say you'll never leave me lonely, girl
That was a lie
I  never wanna see your face again
I don't even wanna be your friend
Don't wanna be used by you again
So I'm saying goodbye
[1]
 - Girl, I know that you're thinkin'
I'm just playing with your head
And I know you been tossing
And turning in your bed
Trying to figure out the reason
Why I left you all alone
Was it worth you giving up
The greatest love you've ever known
Listen baby
[2]
 - Baby, whatcha gonna do without me
Whatcha gonna do without my love
Whatcha gonna do when my love is gone away from you
Whatcha gonna do without me
And everything I used to do for you
Whatcha gonna do when my love is gone away from you
Alright
I never shoulda put my trust in you
But I never thought you'd let me down
It seems like you get a thrill out of
Out of making me cry
And baby everybody's seen it but me
Cuz I was so blind I couldn't see
I never really needed your help
I could do for myself
[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 2]
Baby, can't you see
I want it for you more
Than you want it for yourself
Always there for you
I was there for you, there for you
What ever you needed
You know what I've gone through for you
[MJG]
I was saying bye-bye baby
Now whatcha gonna do
My love is gone, the money gone and the house too
Now how bout you?
Get away from me and let me clear my mind
This is hurtin' me just to visit you one more time
I know you fine but I ain't gonna get distracted by your charm
I figure this is the beginning, you intended some harm
Remain calm, it ain't no reason to drop the ball
you should get 10 points just for being On My Arm
But still, that's the past tense, I was speakin' a then
You asking me 'bout that woman now, it's a negative ten"
I had to catch myself before I tried to make her my girl
Start a family and start to bring kids in this world
See life is like a gun, it can backfire then shoot you.
What's good for the present ain't always good for the future
I shake and shiver, look deeply in the mirrow at myself
Wondering will I make it with someone else
Whatcha gonna do...

(What if) what if I woke up from this madness and this shit was just a dream
(What if) what if I really went to work and didn't spend a whole day creeping?
(What if) what if you were at the beauty shop and you didn't hear about me last weekend?
(What if) what if you ever asked me a question and I didn't stut-stut-stutter all of the time?
(What if) what if I wasn't so damn controlling, you would stiiiill

Why Can't We Get Along 
[Intro: harmonizing]
[Verse One:]
Is it me,
Who never compromise,
I only see things through my eyes,
Which means is my way?
Or is it you
Who's always shutting down,
Never wanting to talk about the problems we got?
[Pre-Chorus:]
Or is it we to blame for all that's going down?
I say that I love you but we can't work it out.
It's making us not wanna stay around.
We need to sit down and ask ourselves..
[Chorus: 2x]
Why can't we (why can't we)
Why can't we get along
When we know we can't be away from each other for long?
Why can't we (why can't we)
Why can't we get along
When at the end of the day we know we gotta come home?
[Verse Two:]
Tell me
Why can't I look at you
And see your point of view
And take the back seat?
Is it true
That I'm so unreasonable 
And I don't know how to love
Even though God sent to me to you?
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus 2x]
[Bridge:]
I just can't sit and watch us go at each other this way.
'Cause you know like I know we're better than this.
Girl, I've tried everything in my heart but it's weighing to be more than just your man.
'Cause you deserve the best.
Together we're the best.
We just can't throw it away...
[Chorus 2x]
[Bridge Two:]
'Cause you know I love you, and I know you love me
Can we, can we baby?
Oh, why can't we get along, when we both know that this is home?

Why Does 
All the love you've given me
So special seems to be no limit
I'll do anything
There's no boundries to how we can grow
How can I let you know
Girl, let me sit and think, oh
[Chorus:]
Why does the wind blow
Why does the sun shine
Why does the rain fall down on my face
Why does the earth spin
Why do the waters reach the shore
And tell me, tell me why
Why do I love you like I do
Oh, in the past
You were there when I was down
My friends could not be found
Your touch kept me so strong
But our love didn't fade away
Instead it sails inside the sky
That's why I must ask why
I must ask why
[Chorus]
I ask myself the question time and time again
(Baby I love you)
Baby I love you
(Yes I do)
Why did you have to hurt me
And leave me all alone
(Baby I love you)
Oh, baby I love you
Now I'm all alone when I need your love

Your Letter 
I saw a letter lying on the floor
I couldn't help but look inside
Thought it was something that you must've left
Left there for me to find
All your words were on that page
All my dreams came true that day
I found
[Chorus:]
Your letter...
Your letter...
It said you loved me
But you didn't know the words to say
It said you never knew that you could ever feel this way
It said you only wish someday that I would feel the same
In your letter
Your letter
I guess it just never occured to me
That you would feel the way I did
You kept the sweetest secret from my heart
You kept those feelings in
Though you never showed a sign
Give a clue to what I'd find
Inside
[Chorus]
I was so happy that I almost cried
To think that you would think of me that way
It's like you took my sweetest dream
And made that dream come true
I would be with you
Always...
I saw a name I didn't recognize
I felt the tears come to my eyes
Seeing that the love that you've been longing for
Was another love, not mine
No, you never showed a sign
But it was right there in the lines
Inside
Your letter
Your letter
It said you loved him
But you didn't know the words to say
It said you never knew that you could ever feel this way
It said you only wish someday that he would feel the same
In your letter
Your letter
I saw a letter lying on the floor...

You Said 
It was you, it was me, it was love, it was real, then we touched,
Then we kissed, then we loved da way it feels, it was
Time to spend together leaving all da world behind n I thought it would last
But only time would tell so I waited on time
How could you be so selfish never once did you compromise n you wonder
Why I'm trippin take my hand and close my eyes
It was you who never listened when I tried to talk to you
And you knew something was missing we were running from da truth
Baby you said you would never leave me, said, you always be there for me,
I can't understand da reason, why you, why you
Wanna play me, you said, you would never me said,
You always be there for me I can't understand da reason, why you, why you wanna play me
We were real, we were chill you would tell me how you feel you wanted me
You needed me da only one to ease your mind I was
Caught by surprise to hear you say you wanna leave
But it's cool if you gotta go then go ahead n leave imma be around
How could you be so selfish never once did you compromise n you wonder
Why I'm trippin take my hand and close my eyes it
Was you who never listened when I tried to talk to you
And you knew something was missing we were running from da truth
[2x]
 Baby you said you would never leave me, said, you always be there for me,
I can't understand da reason, why you, why

1001 Nuits 
Hier encore j'ai mal dormi
J'ai cru entendre du bruit
Le lendemain j'ai appris que les keufs avaient fait une sauterie
Fruit de l'op?ration : un homme mort dans son lit
Cela fait d?j? une semaine si on en croit l'autopsie
Ca fait maintenant 1001 nuits que j'ai le sommeil l?ger
Je n'ai ferm? qu'un oeil, les sir?nes m'ont r?veill?
J'ai vu des gyrophares bleus fuser dans toute la ville
A la poursuite de voitures aux mains des conducteurs habiles
Mes voisins d'en face j'les ai jamais sentis
Car du soir au matin j'entendais des cris
C'?tait le mari qui tabassait sa femme et ses enfants
Mais le jour de son jugement on lui a dit t'es innocent
2, 3 mecs dans mon quartier sont partis s'amuser en boite
Et pour pas finir dans la boite, arm?s jusqu'au cou ils d?barquent
Ca s'?clate un max tout le monde est p?t? au whiskas
En 10 secondes ?a tourne en coups de bouteilles et en coup de chlas
J'suis choqu? quand j'vois dormir des SDF dehors allong?s par terre
J'ai l'impression qu'ils sont morts
Perdus dans leurs cauchemars entre la vie et la mort
C'est ? la morgue que cet hiver on retrouvera leur corps
Ca fait ? peine 5 minutes qu'un d?tenu est lib?rable
Les murs l'ont rendu instable j'crois qu'il a p?t? un c?ble
La nuit est ? sa merci y'a rien de bon dans son regard
Le lendemain tr?s t?t, retour a la case d?part
Pour un oui pour un non ?a prend comme un feu de paille
Tout d'un coup tu entends comme un train qui d?raille
Gare ? ce moment l?, que les coeurs soient de taille
J'marche ? un m?tre du sol et j'suis super fly
Pour un oui pour un non ?a prend comme un feu de paille
Tout d'un coup tu entends comme un train qui d?raille
Gare ? ce moment l?, que les coeurs soient de taille
J'marche ? un m?tre du sol et j'suis super fly
A notre instar dans l'ghetto c'est l'abattoir
Vaut mieux ?'tre vigilant et vif sur tous trottoirs
Les espoirs sont minces, tu connais l'histoire
Fais gaffe ? toi ce soir on t'attend dans ton couloir
Perdu dans une soir?e, j'suis m?me pas invit?
Y'avait que des cr?nes ras?s avec des blousons de l'arm?e
Dans leurs levis serr?s, au cou la croix gamm?e
Apparemment des skins d?cid?s et affam?s
Plus le temps passe passe plus il fait sombre sombre
Plus les nuits tombent tombent
Plus de fr?res ? l'ombre l'ombre
La nuit c'est le bordel, parfois c'est mortel
Demande aux keufs qu'ils se prennent des explosifs comme cocktail
Apres une demi heure de marche, on s'?gare dans une impasse
Un chat noir qui passe, synonyme de poisse
Faut pas qu'on reste sur place, y'a comme une odeur de chiasse
Mon pote t'?tais pas loin du compte, y'a les keufs face ? face
Pour un oui pour un non ?a prend comme un feu de paille
Tout d'un coup tu entends comme un train qui d?raille
Gare ? ce moment l?, que les coeurs soient de taille
J'marche ? un m?tre du sol et j'suis super fly
Pour un oui pour un non ?a prend comme un feu de paille
Tout d'un coup tu entends comme un train qui d?raille
Gare ? ce moment l?, que les coeurs soient de taille
J'marche ? un m?tre du sol et j'suis super fly

10 Minutes Chrono 
Y'a pas qu'nos sant?s qu'on d?t?riore, barrior comme y'a pas ailleurs
On fait trembler Paris comme Capone 
Et les gambinos l'on fait ? Chicago et New York 
? coup d'sulfate et on file ? l'anglaise, 
Chez nous cr?che les meilleurs pilotes, 
10 minutes chrono pour les plus pr?coces 
Pour faire l'amour ou foutre sa vie en l'air 
En tapant un rail ou ? faire l'con sur les railles ? la gare 
Pour s'retrouver d'vant la barre, 
Jusqu'a stopper par une brigade qui s'envergonne defouraille
10 minutes chrono pour s'retrouver au bout du rouleau ou dans l'bon filon, 
R'filer des stocks bourrer d'kilos ou vider l'coffre d'une banque au culot 
Pour prendre un billet d'avion et filer loin 
Comme Nicolas Hullot pour des rouleaux d'euros
On n'est pas frilleux on a le prix nobel des rebelles
On est des filloux des foullets
10 minutes chrono pour ?merger au reveil 
Une fraction d'secondes pour t'manger un pruneau ou faire un tonneau
Refrain
Ca sent mauvais quand t'entends les corbeaux 
Tout peut basculler d'une minute ? l'autre 10 minutes chrono
On a les crocs nous on est comme devant un porno
ou d'vant un coffre qui p?se trop lourd
Chut pas un mot si on coince si on pince on est pas ronds 
Ca peut basculer d'une minute ? l'autre 10 minutes chrono hhah 
On a les crocs nous on est comme d'vant un porno 
ou d'vant un coffre qui p?se trop lourd
10 minutes chrono pour prendre ta douche en cage, 
Pour faire ton pactage ou apr?s un gros coup 
Pour faire le partage pour rafler le pactole
Toutes les 10 minutes passe une patrouille 
Dans ma banlieue y'a pas d'puits de p?trole
Pour duper les cam?ras de surveillance 
Y'a plus grand chose qui nous ?pate, on a un mental en m?tal
10 minutes chrono pour tout perdre aux cartes
Savourer un joint du N?pal ou ? la bourse pour couler tes finances
10 secondes pour qu'un videur t'recalle en bo?te et t'd?bo?te 
Faut pousser la b?te, la navette, enfiler la veste ? capuche 
10 minutes chrono pour toucher un crapus en visant le foie,
Plus 1 fois 10 minutes pour creuser un trou ? la pelle dans un bois 
S'qu'on ? a faire on l'repousse jamais ? redois
Escalade sur les toits on parle p't'?tre de toi
10 minutes chrono pour qu'ma clique soit aux abois
Pour beaucoup moins qu'?a on t'fume si tu laisses une ardoise derri?re toi
Refrain
Des fois y a un flic, y a ton coeur qui palpite
Essaye de semer les flics sur les voies rapides c'est le temps qu'il te faut
Pour accoler une racli, pour vider une bombe lacrymon?ge ? un CRS
Pour une petite gaterie, pour manger un maf?, charger les batteries
On a les crocs de la cons' et on boit le sky en Paris ? Vitry
On est pas kho, on veut vite grimper
On est conscient qu'on peut y rester ou regretter
En 10 minutes chrono pour que l'juge t'acquitte ou te mettre perp?te
Pour qu'une bande te taquine ou te rackete
Pour couper une plaquette
4 secondes chrono, h? poucave pour connaitre ta t?te
Pour prendre la poudre d'escamp?te pour r?gler une transac'
Trimballer un gros sac pour le compte d'un gros sac sans piti?
10 minutes chrono pour quitter le pays, le quartier
Juste 10 minutes pour pas se faire allumer
Pour pouvoir partir en entier ou faire cracher le banquier

S?cher les cours comme Miss France 2001

Faible d'esprit, moi je revendique les murs de t?ci
Respect aux miens post? sur le bitume pour se faire un lletbi
Vitry Orly une association est faite
Malfaiteurs organis?s, y'a m?me des coupeurs de t?tes
Bombe lyricale, attaque verbale, ?a va faire mal
Trois malfrats sur une mission, l'instinct animal
C'?tait AP, freestyle racaille, je te l'ai d?ja dit
Clash pas surtout cette combinaison de MC
Ouais, clash pas surtout cette combinaison de MC
Du hall 13 au demi-lune zoo, on s'associe
Rim K
Si tu n'est pas down tu cr?ves, tranchant comme un glaive
Rim K du 113
J'arrose tous les rrozes, je me pose y'aura pas de tr?ves
Viens te frotter ? une vraie pourriture
Le ressortissant des cit?s HLM, qui pose sa signature
Le clan balance la sauce, Vitry et Orly en assoc'
Hausse le volume mec, et ne discute pas les ordres du boss
On est par? pour une exp?dition punitive
On fait tourner le mic comme un spliff pour fumer nos cibles
Ils ne savent pas que notre association est ? craindre
Les couleurs du drapeau fran?ais avec nous vont d?teindre
La moindre erreur de ta part pourrait me pousser ? t'?teindre
Je te garantis que ce sera fait si nos lois tu veux les enfreindre
Tu veux les enfreindre
Ose franchir notre seuil, on t'envoie dans un cercueil
Car ? coup de chlap dans ta gueule, c'est comme ?a qu'on t'accueille
Je t'annonce d?j? ce qui sera ?crit sur ta pierre tombale
Ex?cut? par Rim K, soup?onn? d'?tre un trou de balle
Du cran c'est ce qu'il te faut, pour t'approcher de mes rangs
Il te faut une assurance vie, avant d'entrer dans la cour des grands
C'est toujours genre, je te baise, je r?side toujours au 113
Rappelle toi bien, que si t'es pas down tu cr?ves
De la rime au cris un seul pas et on l'a d?j? franchis
Ici trois lascars de t?ci s'associent, ainsi si tu testes les vieilles
Ainsi s'ach?ve ce freestyle racaille tranchant comme le bled 
De la rime au cris un seul pas et on l'a d?j? franchis
Ici trois lascars de t?ci s'associent, ainsi si tu testes les vieilles
Ainsi s'ach?ve ce freestyle racaille tranchant comme le bled
Mafia k'1 fri
Il y a association de malfaiteurs
Si t'es pas down tu cr?ves, tranchant comme un glaive
Rim K du 113
Il y a association de malfaiteurs
J'arrose tous les rrozes, je me pose, y'auras pas de tr?ves
Il y a association de malfaiteurs
Viens te frotter ? une vraie pourriture
Il y a association de malfaiteurs
Je pose ma signature
Il y a association de malfaiteurs
Vitry Orly en assoc', on balance la sauce
Il y a association de malfaiteurs

Au Summum 
Refrain
Au summum, on prends des risques on s'fout des lois on mise tout, 
Si un jour la chance se pr?sente on tente tout, au maximum jusqu'au bout 
Rim-K
J'tiens au respect, c'est moi Rim-K
Courage si t'a ?cop? pour plus de six mois, 
Tous furax comme dans Snatch, j'mourais chez moi, 
Suspect comme l'arri?re-sale d'un resto chinois, 
Compte sur moi, pour repr?senter nos fav?las ? nous, 
Et si t'es chez les fous jug?s par des faux qui visent le full, 
Le brelant trop branleur, le carr? d'as, 
On a du mal ? dispercer dans les foules ou sort des mar?cages d'escalier, 
S'il faut bien que j'entame un sprint, 
Vas y donne la r?plique aux salopards comme Larry Flint, 
Je suis parre-balle sous ma retskin en souplesse comme Jet Li, 
J'bosse pour la Kabylie mon jet-ski, 
Sache que la peur n'apporte rien a l'homme, d?s l'aube ? l'oeuvre, 
Profite de chaque minute, pour les fr?res ? l'ombre, 
Mise au summum ? l'aise, comme Schumi en Ferrari, 
Sur les circuits avec ce qu'il faut sous l'lit insoumis
Refrain
AP
Dans un coin sombre ?a joue au carte, comme au casino, 
Comme dans casino, sur la table les cl?s d'un coup?, d'un pavillon, 
On sait c'est qui qui domine, 
On sait qui part au boulot avec une mauvaise mine en pensant ? Deauville, 
Qui s'soucie du gouvernement, toujours les m?mes qui mentent 
ou passent de sales moments, clin d'oeil aux garnements
Qu'on d'ja la gouache des 12 13 ans la merde qui leur pends au nez 
Et vivre l'instant pr?sent, ok, certains ont le mauvais train de vie, 
Se sont tromp?s de wagon, se mettent ? bosser ? la cha?ne comme ? Sa?gon, 
Ou Taiwan ?a s'ressent comme la marie-jeanne, 
Si t'es pas d'accord sale con, on va toujours au summum
Quand on s'y met au sommet sur l'ciment, sur les champs de cannabis, 
Sur tout le terrain num?ro dix, avec le c?ur on s'en m?le, 
Pour les mecs bourr?s d'vices ou les novices
Refrain
Au summum on prend des risque on s'fout des loi ont mise tout, 
Ai un jour la chance se pr?sente on tente tout, 
Au maximum jusqu'au bout, jusqu'au bout, jusqu'au bout ... 
On mise tout, on mise tout, on mise tout
Au summum, si un jour la chance se pr?sente, au summum
On tente tout
Rim-K
Au summum dans nos quartiers ? haut risques 
Actifs comme la ballistique dans notre ville, 
J'raconte qu'les faits, j'suis carp? comme un pit sans museli?re, 
On s'voit mal finir notre carri?re comme Jordan ? 40 piges
Sp?cial haute voltige, 113, c'est comme tes deux doigts dans la prise, 
Ou tes deux pieds dans la crise au summum le ghetto est la cerise 
Comme une arme bien huil?e, avec du charisme on prend le bl? o? il est

?coute pendant qu'ton string seche, fluide est mon clan

Les jaloux disent qu'on meure bient?t ? ce qu'il parrait 
Ma vie de nombreux p?riples 
Je prends le fric des MC qui ? chaque sortie du p?riph?rique 
Apelle ? tous les gor?s faut qu'on s'alourdisse
Je pr?pare des trucs horribles dans ma cat?gorie
On veut me tester sur mon terrain sans aucune descente

C'est Ici Que La Vie Commence 
Refrain : 
On est tous pourris par la cit?, 
Hant? par la monnaie 
J'suis pas cingl? au point de vivre dans la pauvret? 
C'est ici que la vie commence 
Entre violence et souffrance 
Chacun a sa cause et s'en bat les couilles des cons?quences 
Armaggedon, fiston, sonne, 
Le monde est sous l'contr?le dune poign?e dhomme ? la solde 
Le seul empire s'attend sur le compte de Babylone 
C'est en ces lieux maudits que le pire et la vie commence 
Ouvre les yeux et grandir dans une salle banlieue en France 
La justice brutalise nos fr?res, les p?res sont blas?s 
Ca pue la pisse autour de nous, la merde, le prix du danger 
Les m?moires sont balafr?s, donc ? chacun ces entailles 
La haine a remplac?e l'amour, lamour nest plus de taille 
Le quotidien un affront, un reflet dont parfois j'ai honte 
Cash, rage et bastons, si je m'en sors, cest pour mon compte 
Les temps sont durs, les hommes sont durs, mon ghetto c'est s?r 
Si tu n'r?agit plus, tu touche le fond au fur et ? mesure 
Quand rien ne progresse, m?me les n?gros se bouffent entre eux 
Un simple regard blesse, ?a mec c'est pire quun coup de feu 
Hardcore r?alit?, c'est pour ma rime urbaine 
Les jours sont les m?mes ici ? Vitry Sur Seine 
Refrain. 
Toujours la m?me chose, l'homme en uniforme bleu restera maudit 
Dans chaque banlieue, et dans chaque t?-ci 
Babylone va sombrer, les jeunes sont r?volt?s 
Le signale est donn?, le face ? face peut commencer 
J'serais pas un de ces n?gros qui travaillera pour l?tat 
Pas d'uniforme bleu, jferais encore moins les 10 mois 
Hors de tout ?a, l'm?ne tranquillement ma petite vie 
Le n?gro de la rue, ruff d'esprit et 100% insoumis 
Avec un flow de bicot qui r?sonne dans tout les bas les haut 
On compte se faire du cash avec, pour ensuite rouler en Merco 
Saper en costards, ? la bouche un putain de cigare 
Un simple mauvais regard et blaaah, je t'exp?dies sur lbillard 
J'pr?pare mon heure de gloire avec mes banlieusards 
Cela m?me si j'dois niquer des ann?es de ma vie au placard 
Mec tant pis, on est tous pourris par la cit? 
Hant? par la monnaie, j'suis pas cingl? au point de vivre dans la pauvret? 
Moi je frappe dans le mille de mon crew et pr?t pour l'an 2000 
Le syst?me et ses conneries, putain c'est pas facile 
Ma zic berce l'adolescence, r?veille la d?linquance 
J'te parle du bitume, gar?on de par mes connaissances 
On veut tous, partir loin des tours, connaitre de nouveaux jours 
Savoir sacrifier sa peau, mourir pour son amour 
J'veux pas devenir une caille mais je tavoue que parfois que ?a mtente 
Pour sortir de c'putain de merdier des solutions, yen a pas 50 
ROHFF dit, la vie est une salope, la moindre erreur c'est lcar-pla 
Travailler dur pour r?ussir, n?gro t'as pas lchoix 
C'est ici que la vie commence, le crash, le quotidien 
Tous dans la m?me merde, d?brouillard pour voir plus loin

Fout La Merde 
J'arrive, je fous la merde comme en concert 
Et je m'jette dans la foule comme un rocker 
Morceau lourd, pas comme Ramzy 
Fous la merde vas-y, Gros, c'est les rham? 
C'est rhami (cest les tontons, cest chaud) 
Les murs transpirent, enl?ve ton T-Shirt, Mani 
On t'mets ? poil comme au 421, au casino ou 
Miami rhinami, l'ami (comme si de rien n?tait) 
Ghetto comme ? Harlem quand on s'ram?ne 
En prison, rends fous les matons 
Si t'es en auto accompagne ce son ? coups de klaxon 
Les gyrophares de keufs en guise de spots 
Des sc?nes ? immortaliser sur cam?scope 
A tous les ?tages de ta tour 
Un son ? te faire griller les feux 
S?cher les cours comme Miss France 2001 
D?lire bonhomme Hors limite ? te faire 
Rentrer ? l'aube roule-toi un gros fumig?ne 
C'est le sexe desserre les fesses 
M?me si tu squattes les bancs jusqu'? en 
Avoir la marque sur les fesses. 
M?me les Foufs sont de m?che 
Fous la merde et garde la p?che 
Refrain 
113 fout la merde 
113 fout la merde 
113 fout la merde 
113 fout la merde ! 
J'arrive je fous la merde comme au Parc des Princes 
Avec mon staff comme Guy Roux on est tous des pinces 
Mouvements de foule de fous 
 Ouais, tout ? fait  comme dirait Thierry 
Relou ou Jean Michel Claqu? 
113 l'?quipe tentends par les murs qui tremblent ? 
C'est comme le 15 de France dans ta chambre 
C'est michto, re-cui,501, boule-?-z?ro 
y'a plus de cheveux qui frisent comme Rocheteau, 
Oh poto fous la merde comme aux puces 
ou comme aux heures de pointe dans le bus 
ou comme au studio quand on bosse 
bouge la t?te jusqu'au torticolis 
m?me gripp? et malade on t'sort du lit 
Si t'es en discoth?que, rentre dans le tas 
L?ve le doigt en l'air, fais le grand ?cart comme Travolta 
Si tu vois flou et que tu rentres saoul 
L?ve la cuvette et comme Tiger Woods vise bien le trou

Hold Up 
J'suis postich?, j'ai les m?mes cheveux qu'Dalida 
La barbe de Fidel Castro et un gros beretta 
La gabardine de Columbo, les lunettes d'Elton John 
Et la d?gaine distingu?e des fr?res Dalton. 
Les lieux sont rep?r?s, 9 H devant la banque, 
J'suis devant le sas, je sonne et je rentre, 
J'fais la queue comme tout le monde, 
Mes potes m'attendent 2 rues plus loin, 
J'suis op?rationnel dans 30 secondes, 
Je guette le vigile qui m'regarde bizarre, 
Je m'approche de lui et j'lui dis qu'est-c'que tu veux connard ? 
J'lui mets un coup de plafond 
Et direct j'lui sors mon arme, 
Je braque la grosse pute qui s'trouve derri?re le comptoir: 
Ferme ta gueule, on va pas en faire toute une histoire. 
D'ailleurs ouvre le sas y'a mes potes sur le trottoirs, 
Je sors les sacs de sport en un temps record, 
J'veux juste l'oseille et dans 5 minutes je sors. 
Refrain: 
On fait notre entr?e dans la banque 
Sans faire toc-toc-toc 
113 / Intouchable, ferme ta gueule, c'est un hold-up ! 
On braque, charge les sacs et on d?colle, 
La main sur la d?tente, tu seras pas l'seul ? embrasser l'sol ( x 2 ) 
D?mon / AP 
Montre en main tout est OK 
J'suis pr't pour le feu d'artifice concentr? dans mes pens?e, remarque 
L'entr?e des artistes, artistes cagoul?s, 
J'donne l'ordre que tout l'monde s'mette ? terre, 
J'tire une fois en l'air, c'est bon on a le feu vert. 
Monsieur le directeur, on vient relever les compteurs. 
On va passer 1 heure ? attendre les inspecteurs, 
Assez parl?, et passons aux choses s?rieuses, 
J'ai pas l'temps de m'attarder, chaque seconde me sont pr?cieuses, 
Pendant qu'on est dans les temps, je m'occupe de l'argent de surface, du 
Travail de pro, t'inqui?te, on laissera pas de trace. 
J'remplis les sacs ? bloc et l? la pourriture veille, 
Si ?a tourne au drame, on va laisser des cervelles. 
Direction la salle des coffres, j'emm?ne le directeur au sous-sol, 
Mais l? y'a un p'tit probl?me c'batard veut pas cracher le code. 
Oblig? de le sequester car y'a refus d'obtemp?rer, 
Il a fallu que je lui fasse des photos de sa femme ligot?e, 
Je prends en otage un client qu'a voulu faire le justicier, 
Canon sur la tempe, refais plus ?a, sinon j'vais t'tuer, 
De ce hold-up on en chie, ?a risquerait de finir en boucherie, 
Y'a plus de temps ? perdre, on s'dirige vers la sortie, 
Je remonte les escaliers, les sacs charg?s on peut y aller, 
Je crois qu'les gars on a touch?, un tr?s gros paquet de billets, 
Mais j'allais oublier, j'prends le directeur pour couvrir la fuite, 
Ne paniquez pas on va l'lacher sur le p?riph'. 
OK on s'barre, dans les sacs plus de 100 barres, je pr?viens le D, 
Le M qui sont rest?s ? l'?cart, ? la sortie de la banque, on se pr?cipite vers 
La planque, le D est pr?t ? partir avant qu'il y ait une descente, 
Y a rien qui manque, non ! Le D est l? ? Ouais ! Le M est l? ? 
Ouais ! La pourriture ? Ouais ! Le colonel ? Ouais ! Ouais ! 
Refrain 
Dry 
Apr?s une entr?e surprenante, une sortie plut?t fracassante, 
Mes membres en attente, dans l'attente d'une couille imminente, 
J'garde le contact,d?mon One plus que 10 secondes, 
Plus qu'un sac Gros. 
Juste assez de temps pour finir ma blonde, 
Ils ont l'air charg?s, je pense que le coup a march?, 
Dry au volant, je vous conseille de vous accrocher, 
Freins ? main, t?te ? queue, trace avec mes complices, VR6, 
Compteur 2, 3, 4 et j's?me ta police, j'reprends le volant, 
Sans avoir fait de contr?le technique, 
Mais cette fois-ci moi j'fonce dans le tas, 
Si ?a se complique. 
Ici le M pour le D, premi?re ? droite, keufs ? 500 m?tres... 
Eh ! Y'a d'la poucav ou quoi ? Ces PD's bouchent le p?rim?tre , 
Chronom?tre ? la main, fusil ? port?e de main, 
Personne nous freine car par les quai, moi j'connais le chemin.

J'me fais tout p'tit pour pas qu'les videurs me tricar
A l'entr?e ?a refoule, on n'accepte pas les f?tards
Accompagn?, faut l'?tre si tu veux danser
Le physio qu'est ?la porte ne parle pas un mot fran?ais
2m10, un clando, un beau morceau
Mais ce soir, c'est s?r qu'il y aura de beaux morceaux
Dans les poches plein de biftons de quoi m'amuser
Prendre la bouteille, ?tal? sur un canap?
Veste enroul?e autour du bras, tout le monde est sur la piste
Petits pas synchronis?s qu'on a r?p?t? ? dix
Moi et mes complices sur la m?me longueur d'ondes
J'ai d?j? choisi ma go
et pour mon pote j'ai rep?r? une blonde
Y a du monde dans la salle, les as en Lacoste
Le DJ a ses platines, sa mixette et son vieux poste
Tu sais nos beaux d?lires on ne les a pas oubli?s
Des bonnes soir?es y'en n'a pas des milliers
Entre jackpotes, on donne ?a ? l'ancienne
Comme au bon vieux temps pour nos potes et ceux qui tra?nent avec nous
Si tu te rappelles du tube du ghetto
Pour nos jackpotes, pour nos jackpotes, gros
J'ouvre mon armoire j'prends une chemise m?me pas repass?e
J'regarde dans la glace et j'me dis c'est d?class?
A c't'heure-ci, ? l'entr?e ?a doit s'tasser
Oh calmez-vous
Alors j'rase ma barbe de 2 semaines, j'suis pas press?
?a devrait passer m'me si j'ai les yeux cass?s
Et m?me si j'suis avec 8, 9 disjonct?s
On cache nos armes dans le buisson
Ma gueule s'marie bien avec le son
Hey gar?on, c'est pour moi l'addition
On a dans? comme des tar?s, j'suis essouffl?
Pour m'raffraichir j'vais au bar pour consommer
Accoud? sur l'comptoir, les lunettes Cartier baiss?es
J'remarque que tous mes potes venaient juste d'arriver
Et la j'l?ve mon verre de coca, j'picole pas
J'porte un toast ? tous mes fr?res d'africa et c'est comme ?a
Vu l'ambiance, fallait du cran pour stopper la sono
On rentrera ? la cite ? l'heure du premier m?tro
Entre jackpotes on donne ?a ? l'ancienne
Comme au bon vieux temps pour nos potes et ceux qui tra?nent avec nous
Si tu te rappelles du tube du ghetto
Pour nos jackpotes, pour nos jackpotes, gros
J'suis dans l'arri?re salle du cote official
Faut toujours 'tre optimal avec mon p'tit verre de sky
Et m'laisse aller sur un son de Georges Benson
Les stomboscopes font briller mes Jean Marie Weston
A l'ancienne j'fais un p'tit tour sur moi-m'me
Dans la foul?e rep?re une jolie demoiselle
Toutes les femmes ce soir se sont fait belles
Sans aucun doute j'mets mon p'tit grain d'sel
N'abuse pas sur la boisson j'ten prie fais pas le con
Hey baisse d'un ton, tu sais ? qui t'as affaire tonton
J'suis avec Jeannot Mandjack adoss? ? un poteau
Ce soir c'est relax j'suis avec mes jackpotos
Ici c'est timal j'suis avec ap dans l'arri?re salle
Montez tous dans le golf et dans 5 minutes on remballe
Et tetkal ce soir c'est festival
En 2000 on met ?a l?gal c'est la totale

Pour nos jackpotes, pour nos jackpotes, gros
Entre jackpotes on donne ?a ? l'ancienne

La Familia 
C'est pour la famille.
Une pens?e pour ceux qu'ont perdu leurs parents.
Maman n'est plus toute jeune aussi, c'est la seule femme que j'aime.
Comme tous les parents du monde, ils m'ont vu avocat ou m?decin
Toujours un enfant ? leurs yeux, trop de fois j'suis absent
J'cr?ve l'abc?s de l'amour, 
Comme ceux qui ont mal tourn?, parce qu'on les as d?tourn?s.
Les conseils de la famille, c'est l'exemple de mes parents 
Que je retiens pour que demain soit OK.
J'ai su me prendre en main pour chaque journ?e.
C'est comme un contrat qu'on a sign?, 
J'ai jamais insult? mon p?re ni ma m?re, toujours le respect.
En tourn?e, je me sens loin de vous, 
Mais sachez que mon coeur est toujours l? pr?s de vous
Il y a votre sang, il y a votre chair, mon ciment
Il y a l'Afrique, vous ?tes ma terre, mon continent.
Refrain (x2)
Trop de fois j'ai troubl? vos nuits de sommeil, 
Mais je vide mon mal, de vous ? moi
Trop de fois, on ignore ce qu'on d?tient, 
C'est le coeur qui parle, c'est le coeur qui parle.
Y'a rien de plus pr?cieux, mon p'tit fr?re, 
Ma p'tite soeur, ma m?re, je garde sous les yeux.
J'me sens coupable, coup? du monde, d?s que je te vois souffrir.
Je m'excuse en chanson, maman, je tenais ? te dire, la nuit, le plus souvent
J'y pense ? chaque fois, tous ces moments o? nous ?tions en froid, rappelle toi.
J'?tais peut-?tre trop na?f, trop jeune pour comprendre, 
Alors qu'il suffisait d'en parler pour s'en-tendre.
C'est douloureux mais la famille y'a rien de plus pr?cieux.
Mon p'tit fr?re, ma p'tite soeur, je garde sous les yeux.
Ils sont si jeunes, des fois je chiale comme ma m?lodie.
Mon coeur a faibli comme frapp? par une maladie
J'ai des l?sions internes, je suis un homme, ?a devrait aller.
Tous ces mots montrent ? quel point nous sommes li?s.
Pr?s du b?ton, du sol, o? je suis l'a?n?, je suis pas le seul
J'en connais le salaire, le soir quand j'rentre seul.
Y'aura toujours des cris et des larmes, 
succ?deront les sourires qui r?chaufferont nos armes
Pour refaire place aux fou rires.
Refrain (x2)
Quelques lignes en guise d'excuses, 
Prends ta m?re dans tes bras, gros, fais lui une grosse bise.
A la femme la plus courageuse du monde
Tout comme toi j'aimerais avoir du coeur et ?tre aussi croyant que mon p?re
On n'a pas eu la m?me jeunesse, 
Dieu sait que depuis que je sais lire et ?crire
J'ai pas connu la guerre mais presque, j'ai connu Vitry.
Quelques lignes en guise d'excuses, pour la paix de l'esprit, je paye le prix
C'est mon p?re qui me l'a appris, avec un grand fr?re comme soutient
Des soeurs qui n'ont jamais d?shonorer la famille 
Et ? qui je tiens des deux ?tres que j'ai pas toujours ?cout?
Certes de moi-m?me je suis d?go?t?, parfois d?rout?
En esp?rant que Dieu et ma famille vous me pardonnez.
Inch'Allah, j'viendrai ? bout de vos soucis.
Apr?s tout ce que vous avez subi, je vous souhaite une longue vie
Je tiens ? vous l'avoir dit, avant que vous ?coutiez ceci 
De la part d'un homme, votre fils.

Le Guide Du Loubard 
{au Refrain, x2}
C'est le guide du loulou, bar, by night, dans tous les coups foireux et dans toutes les arnaques.
J'suis un putain d'clando, j'arrive de Vitry en cargo.
Dans le rap, j'veux 80% du march? comme Pablo.
Je m'appelle Rim-K alias D?d?, dans le quartier tout le monde me conna?t.
J'connais les rues comme si j'les avais faites, j'suis la cerise sur le ghetto.
J'tra?ne toujours dans l'm?me bar avec les m?mes roulures, les m?mes loubards.
Depuis que j'ai la t?l? en couleur, en embrouille avec mon rasoir, depuis l'?poque Beloumi et Madjar.
Je vis, ?a me suffit, y a peu de choses que je savoure
Mon autoradio vol?, toujours une cassette de Renaud ou d'Aznavour.
Conduite nocturne en ?tat d'ivresse en 16S.
Un contr?le de police et j'fais p?ter l'alcotest
Je refuse jamais une bagarre ? mains nues ou au tourne-vis.
Connu des mioches ou des vigiles de Leclerc, fils.
J'raconte aux filles pleins de conneries.
J'mange aux cr?pes en pastiche, eh l'aziz, d'vant les pompes ? essence de nuit
Et gros, je me barre, j'enfile un jeans, apr?s avoir passer une heure au chiotte avec un magazine.
{au Refrain, x2}
Toujours contre l'mur j'murmure, toujours un peu crasseux sur les bords
J'crache, j'ro-te, j'me censure.
Tord boyaux et pollen, quand je suis sage, Minute Maid.
Je tra?ne qu'avec des Mamadou et des Mohamed
J'suis bousill? comme mon interphone, tu m'as bien vu, tard le soir dans la rue
J'suis pris au s?rieux par Interpole.
C'est l'guide du loubard, c'est pas le titre d'un film tout pourri de banlieue
Tu ressens bien le b?ton ? cent lieux.
C'est Rim-K alias D?d? tout le quartier me conna?t, je connais les rues comme ma poche.
Quand y a du grabuge, j'mes la capuche, l'?charpe pour les manifs
Grand dieu, rend gr?ce au taxi baskets et aux petits week-ends avec les sounds de quartiers
Dans les petites provinces o? on barbait tout.
?a rime pas, j'm'en fous, c'est mon morceau j'fais ce que je veux, qui veut test le loubard ?
J'suis dans tous les petits boulots, le pr?f?r? des petites vieilles
Le m?cano, toujours les mains dans les calots.
Quand je m'ennuie, un jour j'?tais en garde-?-vue, pourquoi ?
J'sais plus, en tout cas personne n'a dormi.
Un clando, roi du poker, de la Playstation et de la 103 SP, j'marche bancal et j'parle sans respect.
J'aime bien les films de Bruce Lee, j'ai test? la prise sur un mec, j'lui ai p?t? la m?choire.
Deux mois de pur?e Mousline.
Ecris ? la baraque en chaus-sons.
Alors, hein ! Elle vous plait ma chanson.

Le Princes De La Ville 
Peu d'?l?gance dans mes ?crits, normal pour un mec de Vitry
Sur ma feuille le ghetto, je retranscris
Zigzaguant entre le mal et les d?lits
Jeune d?brouillard, une fois sorti du lit
Au ch?mage pourtant jeune et ambitieux
C'est pour nous qu'ils ont cr?? l'ANPE
Mais y a une queue d'un kilom?tre pour gagner 3 p?p?tes
Si j'peux permettre qu'ils aillent se faire mettre
Alors les bacheliers s'engagent ? l'arm?e
Et pour le petit smicard y a de quoi s'alarmer
Des bracos ? main arm?e car tout ?a y'en a marre mais
Un jour les keufs viennent te ramener
Vitry 9-4 de ma ville j'veux ?tre le prince
J'vais pas t'cacher que Monsieur le maire est 1 pince
Des promesses y a pas ? dire il en a toujours
R?nover les batiments on attend toujours
Et vos monuments ? 100 barres nous on s'en fout
Soit-disant d?put? en costard ils sont fous
Comme tout citoyen j'suis cens? aller voter
Histoire de dire que j'existe dans leur communaut?
A la suite j'f?licite les gros bonnets de l'illicite
Pas d'ing?nieur dans mon ?quipe
{Refrain:}
On est jeune et ambitieux
Parfois vicieux
Faut qu'tu dises que
Tu peux ?tre le prince de la ville si tu veux
O? tu veux, quand tu veux
Ambitieux parfois vicieux...
On vit en HLM les uns sur les autres
Les lits superpos?s, j'ai rien connu d'autre
On a la rage mais comment rester sage
On vis en marge, en gros on est tous barges
Souvent les huissiers ? ta porte font ?ruption
Si tu payes pas ton loyer c'est l'expulsion
Val de Marne haut pourcentage d'immigration
Aussi ?lev? que tous mes fr?res qu'ils mettent en prison
Et pour s'payer un avocat faut plein de pascals
Au tribunal on s'en sort toujours mal
?a se ressent dans les sentences on a jamais eu d'chance
Vu les circonstances, fuck la p?nitence
T'as pas r?gle tes amendes, le Tr?sor Public t'a coinc?
Fini les vacances d'?t?, tu fais des TIG
Sur toi on met la pression
Ta boite aux lettres est pleine de rappels et d'assignations
Ouais mec c'est ?a notre vie
Code 94400 Vitry
La banlieue a ses qualit?s et ses d?fauts
Peuple?s d'artistes et de sportifs de haut niveau
D'escrocs dans les halls jusqu'aux bureaux municipaux
Tous vitriots
Et m?me si c'est pas tous les jours facile
J'veux ?tre le prince de la ville

Les Evades 
(Avec Rohff Ogb, Mokem)
Heu, appel ? toutes les unit?s 
On recherche quatre ?vad?s 
d'un quartier chaud de Vitry sur Seine 
Description, deux n?gros, deux beurs 
Je r?p?te deux n?gros, deux beurs 
Ils sont pr?t ? tout 
Pour eux, il n'y a ni barri?res, ni barreaux, ni fronti?res 
Donc on quadrille le terrain et s'il faut, on lache les chiens 
Attention ils sont arm?s et dangereux 
Rim-K 
Pour des jours meilleurs 
Je fais mon premier pas ? l'ext?rieur 
Tension sup?rieur 
Je reste ? la hauteur avec la mort comme peur 
Tragique destin, faut comprendre 
M?me si les keufs vont cramer 
Sache que jamais j'irais me rendre 
Nos fr?res d'Afrique ont organis? notre fuite 
Mais il y'a une couille 
Y'a poursuite derri?re moi 
S'agrippe un tas de flics 
Faut que j'assume, y'a pas ? chier, y'a pas ? discuter 
Le jour o? on m'a boucl? 
C'est comme si on m'avait amput? 
Encul? si j'avais pus, je vous aurais tous br?l? 
Mais je ne pense qu'a les semer 
Mon heure n'as pas encore sonn? 
Diff?rentes p?rip?ties 
Je suis comme un gibier dans la nature 
Je cavale et rase les murs 
Je cherche un endroit s?r 
Peu ? peu j'esquive ces ordures 
Je vais plus loin que la censure putain d'envergure 
C'est bien moi RIM K, la pourriture 
J'arrive au QG mMalheureusement de partout je saigne 
J'ai bris? les cha?nes 
Pour ma patrie, Vitry sur Seine 
Refrain (x2) 
Mokem 
Putain tricard, traqu? 
T?te mise ? prix, t?te fich? 
Recherch?, en vente dans tous le pays 
Des ?vad?s, 113 pr?sum? dangereux 
Tu me coupe la route, c'est bouillant 
On ouvre le feu 
OGB 
Malheureusement c'est reparti en couille 
Pas le temps de se lamenter 
Va falloir faire preuve de d?brouille 
Faut surtout pas se faire attraper 
On vit chacun de notre c?t? 
Un seul but, une cit? 
P?n?trer dans une cage d'escalier 
Pour observer leurs gestes et faits 
Agir comme des ?vad?s 
Surveill? de pr?s par les kond?s 
Cette fois d?cid?, les points ferm?s 
Agissant les yeux ferm?s 
A matraquer puis menotter un gamin 
Lui faire la hala au commissariat jusqu'au lendemain 
De toute fa?on, on n'y peut rien 
Il faut comprendre, il faut apprendre 
Qu'il n'existe pas de choix en commun 
Pour faire face ? son propre destin 
Je continue ma route la d?marche lente et m?fiante 
La peur d'?tre identifi? par des voisins me hante 
Mes potos me manquent d?j? 
Et personne n'est pr?t ? m'affirmer 
Qu'ils ne sont pas de retour au Kapla d?j? 
Au grands mots, les grands moyens 
J'intervient, 113 rue Camille Groult 
Quant il le faut c'est l? o? je serais pr?sent sur le terrain 
Rohff 
Soldat en cavale qu'en a marre des cellules 
Marre des promenades la justice, je l'encule 
Me sentir on prends en otage en mal je m'?vade 
Pour mes assoc' m?nent un escapade 
Je fais sauter le grillage 
Je marche en zig zag carri?re fusillade 
Devant moi la libert? ce n'est pas un mirage 
Je revois enfin le paysage 
Ca fait temps d'ann?e que je r?ve de vivre ces images 
Situation critique 
La sc?ne aussi hardcore que cette musique 
Mon coeur bat trop vite 
Mon corps fatigue je casse ma pipe 
Faut que je fasse le vide 
Nique sa m?re, les remords 
Faut pas que je m'endorme parce que le sommeil 
C'est le cousin de la mort 
Ennemi publique comme Jacques Mesrine 
Anti fanatique, je m'instruis 
Pour mieux fuck le syst?me 
Je reti, j'arrive au QG 
Faut que je m'arrache d'ici ? tous prix 
Je suis sur qu'? cette heure-ci 
Mon nom est signal? de sonpri ? Roissy 
Des comptes ? r?gler, un procureur ? schlasser 
Des mecs ? effacer 
Une m?re embrasse, avant de tr?passer 
Refrain (x2)

On s'?tait jur? qu'on se retrouverait 
A la vie, ? la mort d?cor prison 
Quatre murs ?a pue la mort 
Evad?, j'ai r?ussi 
Maintenant, je suis dehors 
Marche avec un oeil dans le dos 
Quelque soit mon sort 
Je vois que tout ? changer 
Les rues ne sont plus les m?mes 
Je cours ? travers la ville 
Banlieue sud, Vitry sur Seine 
Sir?ne police, c'est aussi cram? qu'avant 
Me demande bien 
Si mes gars sont aussi dans les temps 
Chrono quatre heures 
C'?tait R.D.V. au ghetto 
Nom de code 113 pour sauver sa peau 
Et c'est reparti A.P. dit l'affranchi 
Je repense aux gueules qu'on a cass? 
Et ces murs qu'on a franchit 
Fini les parloirs, les cantines et la gamelle 
La sale gueule des matons 
Qu'a quatre heures du mat te r?veille 
Puis je d?dicace ce morceau 
A tous les ?vad?s de France 
P?nitencier de merde 
Qu'a voulut baiser mon adolescence

Les Regrets Restent 
Rim-K 
Ca fait d?j?, et puis j'sais m?me plus 
Que j'aurais p? tout laisser tomber 
L'?cole ma laiss? assis sur un banc ? la cit? 
El?ve trop agit?, qui n'en faisait qu? sa t?te 
Je pr?f?rais les manifs au lieu d'aller ? la biblioth?que 
Eh mec, les devoirs, j'les faisais tard le soir 
Et le matin pour m'r?veiller, c?tait tout une histoire 
J'ai jamais eu une bonne entente avec l?ducation nationale 
Le r?glement int?rieur et la fa?on dont ils travaillent 
Dans des classes surcharg?es, 
Toujours les m?mes qui vont au piquet 
Arriv? en fin d'ann?e, pour passer tas pas ton ticket 
La conseillaire, veut de toi se d?barrasser 
T'orienter dans un truc auquel tu nas m?me pas pens? 
Et en rang jamais rang?, combien de mati?res j'ai d? s?cher 
Entre mes premiers rancarts et mon go?t pour le danger 
J'aimais aussi lE.P.S, pour m?ter les seins des gonzes 
Question bizness, toujours un kilo d'pi?ce 
J'ai termin? mes classes dans la rue o? l? j?tais le bienvenu 
Mais i?i les heures de retenus, c'est 24 heures en garde ? vue 
Les ?tudes y'en a ras le cul, le BAC je lai pas eu 
J'sais quau fond pour ma famille 
Pour ?a, j'les aies toujours d??us 
Aujourd'hui comme tu le vois 
C'est la musique que jprends ? coeur 
Pour faire passer le m?ssage, rememorer mes erreurs 
Eviter les ennuis, m?me si j'aime tra?ner la nuit 
J'ai eu raison de l?cole tant que l?cole ne ma pas nuit 
Refrain 
Boss One 
Les ann?es passent, les regrets restent 
On crit en soi pleins de pourquoi? A quoi bon? 
Seule r?ponse: j'sais pas 
Une chose est s?re, en cours j'ai jamais ?t? bosseur 
Juste un acteur de plus, au fond un emmerdeur 
Boss One 
Ce que j'sais en connaissance de gosse 
C'est clair on devrait ttimbrer 
J'voulais dire que m?me, maurais vu conseiller ? lElys?e 
On m'a pouss? vers ce foutu CAP dmenuisier 
Pour eux, mon avenir se trouvait au Baumet ou ? la Sant? 
A grand coups d'balet, mes r?ves se brisaient 
Que dire ? ces m?mes, les yeux pleins d'sympathie 
Qui m'envient dabord qui jsuis 
Une chose est s?re c'est que jai jamais voulu l?cher laffaire 
Ils m'ont mis la pression, 
Press?s d'me voir gicler les cours de Mr CENSON 
Mordu ? l'hame?on, pour ?tre le couillon parmis les cons 
Les insultes pleuvaient vers ce t'enculer dprofs de MATHS 
Il fallait jamais m'prier pour foutre lahyate 
Avec les ann?es tous se gatte, merde 
On s'jette tous dans le m?me bizness eff?m?re 
Histoire de faire vibre-m?re, 
La mis?re a fait de nous ces hommes en... 
Si j'avais s? jaurais jamais quitt? aussit?t les bancs, et tu lsais

 Rim-K 
J'suis dans le rap depuis longtemps pourtant je nai pas carri?re 
Entre l'?cole, la rue et moi m?me jai mis une barri?re 
L'?ducation scolaire, c?tait 4 ans en arri?re 
Combien de fois j'ai d? de?evoir mon p?re et ma m?re 
J'suis un jeune jai la vingtaine 
La cit? m'a mis en quarantaine 
D'origine Africaine, jcrois que jai pris une lourde peine 
Le rap comme rem?de sans ?tre pass? par le solf?ge 
J'suis dans un pi?ge et encore en vie, cest un privil?ge 
L'?volution dun voyou sur les bancs de l?cole 
Avec les cancres du quartier et les sniffeurs de colle 
Devenus ? notre ?poque braqueur ou buveur d'alcool 
Ou forceur d'anti-vol, ? l?cole c?tait b?n?vole 
Recrut? par la rue, ? moi les gr?ces matin?es 
Premi?re mati?re, locas pipe pour pouvoir d?ner 
On fait des matons content de l'oseille 
Et l'anatomie du poste, et l?ducation physique dans la rue 
A nous faire des bosses 
Devenir g?nie en herbe? Non! 
Mais fumer des gros joins d'herbe? Ouais! 
Avec les potes dans les chiottes de lyc?e 
Et faire la feinte aux profs 
 Mr, Mr j'peux aller pisser ?  
Et puis c'est, avec la t?te baiss?e et les yeux pliss?s 
Qu'on revenait au fond de la classe pour oublier 
Attendant impatiement la sonnerie pour pouvois s'barrer 
Avec sa d?gu?ne de Barial le p'tit tape du crime 
Victime du syst?me ? la sortie sans des livres 
Vu nos capacit?s, on aurait p? quitter la cit? 
Pour l'universit? mais bon on a pas profit? 
J'serai peut ?tre jamais friqu? 
Mais bon j'ai pas tout perdu 
J'ai ma culture du guetto et ma lith?rature de rue.

Militant 
J'ai commenc? le rap les l?vres br?l?es par la weed
La voix enrou?e par la 8.6
Mon seul instinct pour guide, ouvre grand mon c?ur 
Comme un livre en live, la life est un combat qu'on livre
Depuis mon premier couplet, paroles d'homme libre 
Je suis militant
Refrain
Reste fid?le ? toi-m?me, militant, militant
Fid?le ? toi-m?me, militant, je suis militant
Reste fid?le ? toi-m?me, militant, tu es militant
Fid?le ? toi-m?me, militant
Comme j'prends un coup de vieux 
? chaque coupe du monde
Entre deux rondes des uniformes
Je fonce, je perds pas une seconde
Si tu restes fid?le ? toi-m?me
Que tu tiens le coup, comme moi
Allume ton briquet, l?ve le haut
Je suis militant, je suis du ghetto, comme toi 
Je suis comme un boxeur dans le vestiaire pour le combat
Je suis volontaire, je l?che rien
Je suis le contraire du poucave qui peut pas se taire
Des malheureux, il y en a des tonnes 
Comme les gangsters dans les ruelles de Kingston 
Du 9.4 et m?me d'ailleurs
T'es pas le sperme, on transperce et tab?re ses gosses
Militant, il ?tait temps comme un p?re qui bosse
Qui se l?ve t?t et se d?cha?ne jamais
Qui prend les transports et bat des records en heures de taf 
Depuis des ann?es jusqu'? canner
Militant comme un p?nitent h?ritant 
D'une longue peine qui r?pond
S.A.N en se disant que Dieu est grand, mon grand
Faut du cran m?me les poches vident, le ventre vide
Il y a qu'? voir comment les gens vivent, paroles dhomme libre
Je suis militant
Tous les combats qu'on livre cest pour de bon
Si on doit changer les choses c'est maintenant
Tous les combats qu'on livre cest pour de bon
Solidaire entre les gens du ghetto
Refrain
Ouais gros, 113, soit militant
Jeunes filles, jeunes hommes du ghetto
A.P.
Je suis militant comme ces mecs qui prennent de l'?ge en cage,
Leurs visages marqu?s par la rage qui veulent tourner la page
Comme un clando sans faf, sans appart
Sans taf qui lutte pour apprendre le fran?ais 
Et qui se bat, je parle pour ceux ou pour celles 
Qui portent leurs soucis tout seul
Dans la gal?re jusqu'au col
Pour dormir n'ont plus que le sol
Un RM-iste, 3000 probl?mes
3000 balles par mois, 4000 cailleras
Combien de faits divers par mois
Nombreux sont les ?trangers de son b?timent
Divers drames, 2002, et dans la police combien de potes y voyent 
Y en n'a quun ? qui on doit des comptes
Chacun d?fend sa cause pour une vie modeste et d?cente
M?me l'heure des descentes
Au bout de l'avenue, peu davenir en jungle urbaine 
Militant je tenais ? dire
Je parle au peuple, je suis militant avant de partir
Tous les combats qu'on livre cest pour de bon
Militants, jeunes du ghetto tenez coup par tous les temps.....militant
Tous les combats qu'on livre cest pour de bon,
Si on doit changer les choses c'est maintenant,
Tous les combats qu'on livre cest pour de bon,
Solidaire entre les gens du ghetto.

Principalement cainfri arlbi ou krel
Grilles ? 5 kms dont les keufs interpellent

Si tu veux qu'on s'rappelle de toi y'a rien de tel qu'un bon bed du bled
Pour causer des s?quelles j'r?ponds ? l'appel
Ose, l?ve le glaive

J'sais pas si elle est pucelle
Mais dans le lit y'aura querelle, queue raide

O? pour s'en sortir les jeunes se servent de Biz. Ill?gal 
L'?chec scolaire et la mis?re et ceux depuis l'enfance 
Des gal?res sur les bancs. Jusqu'? la grande d?linquances 
A passer des nuits enti?res entres amis, fumer, du Te-shi 
A penser ? des coups , qui pourrait remener un bon Ill?-bi 
Ils n'?taient pas conscients du risque qu'il y avait ? prendre 
Agir sans concession, les feraient aller dans le mauvais sens 
Au fur et a mesure se sont succ?d?s les gal?res, 
les mauvaises affaires, comblaient leurs casiers judiciaires 
Le destin les a frapp?s cette nuit, 
O? ils ont fait leur plus grosse, erreur dans un putain de taxi 
Deux minutes ont suffis pour que tout se complique 
Pour que l'un devienne meurtrier et l'autre son complice 
De nombreuses personnes ont aper?u cette horrible sc?ne 
Nos bandits. prennent fuite la fuite et craignent une lourde peine 
Apr?s les diff?rentes enqu?tes et d?positions 
pour la 1 ?re fois ils retrouveront en prison 
Le fait d'avoir grandi sans avoir une tune en poche 
poussa les jeunes de cit?s ? vivre avec l'esprit Ruff 
Refrain (x2) 
Gosse de rue regarde ce qu'on est devenu 
Ce qu'on a con?u et parti on fum?e 
Cauchemar les bancs de la Cit? 
Les m?mes gal?res, les m?mes histoires 
Les m?mes refrains 
La gloire ?merge seulement pour quelques-uns 
D?j? les ann?e pass?es, ils n'avaient plus rien a perdre 
ils ne vivaient que de mauvaises affaires sur mauvaises affaires 
Que veux-tu l'argent a fait d'eux un vrai cauchemar 
Ils finiront en prison pour ce taxi tu? sur le trottoir 
Dur ? 16 ans de savoir ce qu'est ton futur 
Une victime de plus enferm? entre 4 murs 
La vie derri?re les barreaux n'est pas celle de la rue 
Aie du sang froid sinon moralement on te tue 
Si tu veux te faire respecter, ne pas te faire marcher sur les pieds 
Les r?gles ne sont plus les m?mes, a toi seul de les appliquer 
Maintenant ils d?pendront d'un simple num?ro 
Car insoumis ? l'?tat est la devise d'un mauvais gar?on 
Avec le temps ils r?ussiront ? s'faire respecter 
Dus aux bagarres entre eux et d'autres prisonniers 
Et enferm?s dans leur cellule, ils repensent au pass? 
O? le soir en quelques instants leur vie s'est compliqu?e 
Il ?tait question d'un simple taxi -Basket 
Nos deux bandits voulaient rentrer sans aucune id?e en t?te 
Combien d'entre-eux se sont vus prendre cette destination 
Du jour au lendemain, passer de la rue ? la prison 
La fait d'avoir grandis sans avoir une tune en poche 
Pousse les gars d'chez moi ? vivre avec l'esprit Ruff 
Cauchemar les bancs de la cit?. 
D?di? ? M.A et J.B.

Sans Retour 
L'album 113, on le d?die avec notre coeur ? ceux qu'on aime
A tous nos proches partis trop t?t
A tous vos proches partis trop t?t
Chaque jour, chaque moment, chaque heure, chaque seconde,
On pense tr?s fort ? vous, pensez ? eux, on vous aime, ?a fait mal
C'est dur d'avoir le go?t de vivre apr?s tout ?a
On vit des moments difficiles, c'est pas facile
Mais heureusement qu'on a la foi en dieu
Sinon ?a ferait longtemps qu'on aurait p?t? les plombs
Qu'on n'aurait plus de raisons de vivre
Tu vois ce que je veux dire
Tu sais les souvenirs ?a s'efface pas, ?a s'efface jamais
Ca reste grave dans nos m?moires, dans nos coeurs
On na?t avec, on vit avec, on dort avec et on meurt avec, malheureusement
Cet album aussi, il est d?di? ? toutes les m?res qui nous ont quitt?
Que leur ?me repose en paix
Que dieu veille sur vous, sur nous, sur nos familles, sur tout le monde
C'est ce qu'on souhaite, on n'oublie personne, on n'oublie personne
On laisse parler la musique

Tonton Des Iles 
Timal, ?a fait un bail, que j'suis pas parti au pays
Voir le reste de la famille et les cousins qu'ont grandi
Apr?s huit heures de charter, me voil? enfin sur mes terres J'suis d?boussol? par le d?calage horaire
Accueilli par un homme d'affaires,
laisse-moi porter tes sacs fr?re
Direction la Basse-Terre, Pointe Noire la case ? grand-m?re
On 'ti punch comme tradition, j'ai dit: "Non merci tonton"
Et lui m'a r?pondu: "Tu t'crois encore ne m?tropole, gar?on"
2, 3 jours apr?s, j'me suis mis dans le bain
un p'tit cale?on de bain, pour les plages et les friapins
Pour faim exotique j'ai d?gust? les plats typiques
Colombo, court-bouillon poisson et cabritt
Pour f?ter mon arriv?e, seul, j'suis parti zouker
Kol? serrer, sur le dernier tube de l'?t?
Touriste de passage "Gu? ti fran?ais la" pour le voisinage
Et toujours cette question, "Alors ? quand le mariage?"
Cette manie de maquerellage, ?a date depuis l'esclavage
Au temps de la rue Case-N?gre, les racines de mon village
J'?tais venu pour me reposer, mon s?jour trop mouvement?
Y avait trop de chose ? faire j'ai pas vu le temps passer
{au Refrain}
Quand j'suis arriv? on m'a dit "Bienvenue au pays"
On m'a dit aussi que j'avais perdu les traditions du pays
Je ravis de revoir les cousins et les cousines qui ont vieilli
Trop longtemps en France je crois bien que ma place se trouve ici
Boissart, Bergevin ?a c'est mon bled cousin
Visite de la Soufri?re en passant que ti chemin
Dans les transports en commun serr?s tous les uns contre les autres
Sur un air de biguine pour aller d'un point ? l'autre
Ici la drogue l?gale c'est la Zeb locale
Sous un soleil tropical tu risquerais de lui faire mal
Allong? sur une des plages sous un palmier
En train de siroter un jus de noix de coco glac?
En pensant ? la famille ?lu tonton des ?les
Mais qui cot? ou ko vin A-P j'crois bien que j'viens des Antilles
A?roport du raijt les vacances sont termin?es
L'avion va d?coller, j'suis le dernier ? embarquer

Truc De Fou 
(Avec Doudou Masta)
?a se passe ? Vitry s/Seine, truc de fou, truc de dingue
L? o? les soirs c'est la m?me, on parle d'argent et de flingue,
Les grandes gueules de Camille Groult Star, s'adressent aux banlieusards
9.8 on fait main basse sur les clefs du pouvoir
Contrebande d'alcool pour fournir les d?put?s qui picolent.
Et avec les c?l?brit?s, on passera des nuits folles
Les juges bosseront pour nous et on sortira nos fr?res de taule.
On va tout rafler, ?a y est fini de squatter les halls.
Maison de skeud, c'est bon, au nom de la 113 productions.
J'fait croquer les m?mes du quartier, m?me s'ils connaissent rien dans le son.
Maintenant j'ai tout ce qu'il faut, mon bureau, ma secr?taire,
Et d?s que j'gal?re j'appelle mes potes pour fumer de la beu-her.
Du bedo, d'la beu-her et des dealers en masse
Sur toutes les places skunk, popo, Afghan et Tha? grasse.
Et si la BAC passe donne-leur un bon 10 sac
Ne cours plus pour ?tre tranquille, faut leur graisser la patte.
J'ai d?cid? de prendre des vacances, faire le tour d'la France.
Abuser en h?tel, casino, sans me soucier de mes d?penses.
Je c?toie des bourgeois, femme d'inspecteur, fille d'avocat
Garde du corps dans le dos, si tu m'approches n'y pense m?me pas.
On contr?le les quarties les bo?tes, les restaurants partout on fait la bringue,
Et on lance sur le march? des grosses voitures de dingues.
On s'en fait plus pour la famille en paix au pays
Je suis devenu tellement big, que je pourrais finir Maire de Vitry.
C'est un truc de fou, de dingue, de psychopathe.
On r?gne dans le monde entier, et les putes sont ? nos pattes.
Finis la gal?re, j'm'inqui?te plus pour mes affaires judiciaires.
Et avec mes fr?res on se pr?pare un avenir prosp?re.
On rosse les mecs du front national ? coups de crosse.
Et le premier qui s'en m?le on l'd?sosse.
Que des trucs de fou dans une France atroce.
Faut r?tablir la peine de mort pour les travs et les pointeurs de gosse.
{Refrain: x2}
Des trucs de fou,
pas des trucs de faux zoulous
Des trucs de dingue
De psychopathe rien ? tre-fou
Les gargeots c'est nous,
Le 113 au rendez-vous
Faites attention, pr?parez-vous!
J'ai le pouvoir, certains l'ont, et d'autres ne l'ont pas.
Moi j'fais partie des gens qui posent gros probl?me ? l'?tat.
Et j'me fais plaisir, j'd?nonce et viole leurs lois.
Je montre du doigt les imposteurs qui se font de l'argent derri?re moi.
Et on fera des r?v?lations dans tous les m?dias.
Des putains d'scandales qui inqi?teront tous les chefs d'?tats.
On a d?cid? d'faire tomber tous les hauts plac?s.
Ainsi que tous les escrocs qui sont en planque ? l'Elys?e.
Jusqu'? la maison blanche en passant par Hollywood.
Je laisserai mes empreintes et mes traces ? la Ghetto Youth.
Puisque la vie est hardcore, je suis sans g?ne ni remords.
Et l?che mes loups sur l'arm?e, qui les cr?veront comme des porcs.
Et des kraks boursiers de Wall Street ? Tokyo
Corruption extorsion de fond, enbref le magot.
J'ferai ?crire 1.1.3 sur tous les lingots.
Et ? nos yeux le plus riche de france sera qu'un vulgaire toxico.
Le borgne en premier, puis on s'occupera du reste.
M?me si sa femme court ? poil avec une batte dans les fesses.
On est psychopates, sortis de l'asile de Camille groult.
O? les r?sidents partent au casse-pipe afin de gagner leurs cro?tes.
Des apparts pour tous les sans abris et tous les clandos.
On br?lera les casiers judiciaires des negros et bicos.
1.1.3 solidaire, Mafia K1 Fry l?gendaire.
Levez vos guns bien haut videz vos chargeurs sur les fachos.
J'fais des trucs de dingue comme un gogol fonced? ? l'alcool.
J'prends le monopole, j'prends mon envol.
J'escroque et tout ? les coups je fuck.
Je me moque, je vis dans mon ?poque.
J'te braque m?me pour du toc.
Appelle-moi le barjeot, le malade qui marche en solo.
Accompagn? de mon calibre, de mon couteau, je te troue la peau.
Un truc de fou, de dingue, de psychopathe.
?a te rentre par les oreilles et ?a te ressort par les pattes.
Ok, c'est doudou masta, un k1 fri de plus ? ri-pas.
J'ai mes fafs fran?ais donc j'fais ce que je veux, j'suis chez moi
Un truc de fou renoi, un truc de fou renoi.

Finie la colonie mais ils nous ont pris pour qui
L'Afrique aux africains laisse toi aller 
Comme une balade sur le fleuve Niger en wax en baza
Peuple riche de culture de tradition 
Modeste travailleur paie l'addition 
Je viens hisser le drapeau vert jaune rouge 
Pour moi de sang et pour que mon peuple bouge 
Je suis ni porte parole ni un exemple 
Mais j'aime ma terre donc je milite 
Je represente (Mali) le souvenir de nos absents (Mali)
Le charme de l'accent de nos parents

De village en village je porte la nouvelle en taxi 
Bronze dans les maisons sur les march?s les pousse pousse

L'enfant se repose au soleil sur l'arbre ? palabre 
C'est vrai que chez moi il n'y a pas la mer

A supid singer sings a stupid song 
He tries to tell you that the night is long 
You know hes lying and you know hes fake 
He order whiskey when you order steak 
Nobody loves him but he dont care 
He doesnt want to come home this year 
And all he wanna do is bleed you dry 
Spin you round until it makes you cry 
He wanna take you back in time 
Back to 1959 
You could go to a drive-in 
You could order an ice-cream 
He wanna takke you back in time 
Back to 1959 
Caress you and hold you 
Just like he told you 
Just ike he told you 
What do you think of when you go to sleep 
Did you forget or not to brush your teeth 
You know that people live inside your mouth 
You know the earth it settles in the south 
Your skin is soft - it feels so nice 
You gotta friend in Jesus Christ 
2000 years ago he died for you 
You got a nail thru your adidas shoe 
He wanna take you back in time....

Boy Meet Girl 
Hey, Im awake whats that scent in the air
Do I know this place from before
I wonder where all of my shoes dissapear
Just some traces of dirt on the floor
Does anyone here have some water to spare
Cause I woke with this terrible thirst
Its the romantic notion of harshness to share
Before my testicles burst
Boy meet girl they fall in love
I watch the scene from up above
The angels are gone where angels go
Hell, I dont know
If these angels are real could they follow me home
And reward me for putting my trust
In this bed as the mark of my journey to roam
Thru the nights of obedient lust
I am battered to pieces by vodka and sex
And a fondness for odious sin
I eep making phone-calls at night to my ex
And I wish for her scent on my skin
Boy meet girl they fall in love
I watch the scene from up above
The angels are gone where angels go
Hell, I dont know

Girl With The Clandestine Heart 
I used to love a girl caled Mary-Jane
I used to think that people looked the same
Without their heads on
But then she made my sky complete
I used to watch her fall asleep
I used to kiss her lie the salty sea
I used to think that we where wild and free
So independent
But like buildings people fall apart
Shes the girl with the clandestine heart
She used to tell me things Ive never heard
It made me raise my head just like a bird
When it drinks water
I swore to love her til the end of time
But when I turned around she wasnt mine
I shouldve seen it
I shouldve known it from the start
Shes the girl with the clandestine heart

Its the kindness of strangers
And the absence of harm

And his friendly charm
Hes got a headful of liquor
And a fistful of grass

Of the white middle-class
He do the crazy handstand
He do the funny ape
He do the rocknroll band
He do the total fake
He want the dolphin flip
Adidas handball-shoe
Around the moon and back hit
He do the I love you
Hes got a headful of liquor
And a fistful of hasch
Hes still watching the sky
For the two-seven clash
He is the space invader
Hes a sex machine
He is the caped crusader
Hes a strangers dream

Everything fall apart
Even the strongest heart, part
In the millenium fever
It gets better in 1000 years
Stay in here
Got the millenium stare
Millenium fever
The road remain the same
Heal the lame, millenium shame
The I-dont-care fever
Go nowhere, play with the old toys
In the sauna with the jack-off boys
Ugly cowboys
Theres no need to save the world
Theres no need to save the world
The world is just fine
But the people needs saving
>From the turn of the time
The Millenium craving
Millenium fever
The sign and the descent
The dollar, the cent, the corrupt government
Millenium fever
Turn the engine off, hear the sound
Of the buzzing sky, the silent ground
No-one around
Millenium fever
The anastethic scream
Burn the mind to heal the dream or so it seem
Millenium fever
Dont believe the things you see
The crack, the smack, the LSD
The you and me
Theres no need to save the world...

No After, No Before 
She smells like vanilla
Her mom's from Manilla
It is dark and you walk down the street
You're propped full of dope
Feel like Julian Cope
And you wanna go someplace to eat
She talks, you don't listen
Something 'bout her sisters
It is fall and the trees have turned red
And you don't like her looks
And she doesn't read books
And sometimes you just wish she was dead
You just don't love her anymore
There's no after, no before
There is no sunshine in a fog
And love is a place where dog eat dog
So you start to ignore her
Like all the girls before her
And you hope she will leave by herself
But you're stuck in a spiral
And fear is your rival
He shows up when you're by yourself
So you worry and weep
'til you doze off to sleep
And you dream about her face in the sky
But you can't make a sound
And you're stuck to the ground
'cause even in dreams you can't fly
You just don't love her anymore...

Wouldnt that be a shame

You might live in Kansas City
You might live in sin
You might leave me far behind
Or change me from within
Heres another song about you
Its not something I want to
Its just something that I do
And I could kill you right now
Wouldnt that be a shame

Blockstyle Murderah 
* [Taydatay]
Stack chips like Don Trump
Comin' wit the slump
So original head bustas
Makin' moves from the junk
Mashin' niggas [???]
We stay loaded, fully loaded
Let the game be noted
We only comin' wit the coldest, hold up
In '99 we breakin' 'em off wit major heat
Sweepin' the industry off they feet
Hypnotize 'em wit the beats
It's the most hated, America's most blunted
See niggas come from the bottom
Then we turn around and run it
Comfront it, we got cha
Hollow points in the chamber
Releasin' the anger
Fuckin' around get caught up in the caper
People stoppin' my paper
Ain't no time for no games
I'm watchin' niggas catch the vapors
While I'm doin' my thang
I hit the back and I swang
Niggas and bitches they be jockin'
They wanna floss wit us
Cuz they know we 'bout the lock and load
We warmed up for the score
'Bout to hit 'em wit a little bit of hardcore
[Chorus] x 2
Cuz in my lifetime I'd a done gang of shit
Invloved wit 211's, 187's for the chills
Another blockstyle murderah
Another blockstyle murderah
We 'bout to have it bitch

And since I was a itty bitty niggy on the corner
I was a performer
Now my music gets women through California
Love to get up on it
We disinigrate all opponents
And represent niggas, windows tinted
Till you can't [??]
It's the O to the fuckin' A-K
D to the A-L-D
Fuck what the haters say, we paper chase
So you can't tell me a muthafuckin' thang
But the [?]
We [?] too much blood gushers
Cuz you ain't the one that run the hood
We [?] from the goods
Like they say, "Talk is cheap"
Oh yeah, they workin' the tech
So you get swepped up off your feet
Now break up off of me, heard me
In the game
I'm a fill the lane like I'm James Worthy
Hella slurvy
Yes indeedy that's your boy
That would keep the backpack
And the clack-clack, you be destroyed
You shouldn't have never got me pumped
And now your soul is full of holes
They've come to mop him up
Cuz I was sloppy drunk
And had to pop him up
[Chorus] x 2
[Hennessy]
It's just the flossamatic, caught the cabbage
Nigga what, in the cuts, get no bumps
Till my pockets got the mumps
And when they jump
We let them cats off
But we take yo head off
Wit a [?], no explination, no hesitation
Nigga just smash on
But 'for the chance was smooth
And all the work, yo ass was through
Hoppin' fences, coherant distance while we passin' through
I'm here to let you know boy
We get the [?]
When you fuckin' wit them snow boys
And makin' more noise
[Taydatay]
You know
Cuz we be flippin' the script
On top wit big faces
Known in hella places
Illutin' all the drug cases
Fuck the basics, we goin' all out
We got to show these muthafuckas what the Sco be about
You got to follow your route,
Follow your route, follow your route
Cuz without the paper
Niggas gon' be assed out
I'm talkin' word of mouth
I said, "You in it for the whores"
You know my Hunter's point niggas be straight hard

Garcia Vegas 
Jeah, another Tay da Tight hit
11/5's in the motherfuckin house (4x)
Well I started off a hustla indo smokin
Weed in my lungs so a nigga kept chokin
Eyes kinda red blood shot from the contact
In a 67' Caddy bumpin Gap Band eight track
What you say nigga 11/5's in the house
So let me break it down what us niggas all about
As I step to the scene I got some bitches on the nuts
But I act like a pimp so I don't give a fuck
Step back get back stand in line
You gotta get yours bitch I gotta get mine
It's TaydaTay now can I get a fader
Who got half on the weed and the Vegas?
Players listen before the hoes bounce
I gotta get drunk off a 64 ounce
You can say 800
Got the weed rolled up so it's time to get blunted
Chorus: 
Everybody light your Vega, 
everybody light your Vega, 
everybody smoke, woo hoooo (2x)
Well I'm not braggin everybody's passin
All they weed to me
But the dank ain't enough so I'm hittin all night
To cop a cold M.D.
What up step back and get wasted
Weed in the air I can almost taste it
Take it hit it pass it to a friend
Then you mix it light it quick with the motherfuckin gin
Ooh we bitch now I'm feelin tight
But that's how you doin it when you off dank right
High as a kite I can touch the fuckin sky
But I'm stuck like Chuck and I won't even try
Over high, eleven five
I've been smokin all day you can tell from my eyes
Smoke in my lung you can feel it in my chest
Just copped another gram now guess what's next
Chorus
Now first let's call for the motherfuckin indo
Pull out your crutch and put away your pistol
Nigga this is Frisco bitch I got the bomb
When you're in a rush break it down in your palm
If you ain't got ten you can give a nigga eight
Fade with ya niggas then you browse thru the Point (?)
Pick up the bitch and you put her in the back
But you better have your gat if the ho is a hoodrat (Jeah)
All hoes on the life I lead
I can't function right without a gram of weed indeed
I like to smoke to get high
And I won't stop til the day a nigga die
Anytime anyplace I'm gonna do it like Janet
Tryin to get high with the whole damn planet
I'm a smoke by myself if I can't get a fader
But I won't roll shit without a Garcia Vega 
(Vega, Vega, Vega, Vega)

Hate To See Me Have Shit 
* [Maine-O]
Nigga I'm from the projects
Now pack my check
And I demand respect
You plan a place and get checked
And I'll make your t-shirt wet
See I'm that fed up out the Sco nigga
A pro nigga
What you mean that's all you got
Get your ass on the floor nigga
Move faster if you have to
And if you ain't got what I'm knockin'
Mutha fucka I'm attempt to get me
The convo before I go Joe Blow
I'm robbin' niggas for they doe
And hittin' the cuts and lay low
I'll spray your whole block up
And everybody's gettin' popped up
Nobody got up
Because you bitches all got shot up
Block up my nina, fuckin' supina'd
I'm not goin' back to jail
I'm blastin' niggas to hell
And if I fail then I'm all in
But at least wit a piece
I can release when I'm a star bitch
Cuz I'm a Northern Cali killa
Stack still, a cap pilla
I got dealers stackin' skrilla from jackin' niggas
Chorus: x2 [Hennessy]
Niggas rather see me blasted
I lay dead in the casket
To see me lavage
But I ain't havin' it
The gas pedal I be mashin'
To escape the assassin
Cuz mutha fuckas hate to see me have shit
[Hennessy]
It's time to smash the gas pedal
Openin' off 4-4 barrels
Wit my strap in my lap
Cuz these mutha fuckas jealous
Cuz I drinkin' brews
Wit my man dressed in blue
Top notches on my jock
Tryin' to choose cuz I make it move
That's why I'm 4 deep
Drunk off the Olde E
And if you got beef
Lets hate banger's to the goatee
These scandalous ass bitches
Is just as bad as these niggas
And niggas could get riches
So that these bitches roll in benz's
My business on the hump like R
Wit my windows smoke tinted
So you can't see up in my car
Callin' shots on niggas life's
Like I'm Jesus Christ and uh
Thou shall not grind without kickin' in mine
Cuz time after time they're back
Game scattered like roaches
They be victims of my sickness
Cuz I'm vicious when it's slowly
I'm the nigga bitch
And best believe there's no mistakin'
Cuz these other niggas fakin'
Like they're makin' what I'm makin' nigga
[Chorus] x2
[Taydatay]
Sort of like a psycho
Fuck no, a lunatic
I'm ready to do some dirt
Because I'm deep up that bullshit, wit 45
Different ways to express
These eleven  hollow points  
Into yo mutha fuckin' chest
Who wanna test
That criminal minded nigga bustin' like a savage
All for the love of the cabbage
When I see it, I got to have it
Fuck a ho, and milk a bitch
That be the way
Cuz they hate to see me lavage
Makin' money, gettin' paid on the regular
No hesitations for my filla, realla  
Cuz a nigga illa for the skrilla
Peel yo cap back
And creep like a mutha fuckin' menace
And witness as I jack and bounce wit the quickness
Stack the money in the safe
Rendezvous wit the click
Think of Mr. Make-A-Mil
I'm the mutha fuckin' shit
It's so drastic
And keep away from niggas who be blastin'
And hatin' on a nigga  
Cuz they hate to see me have shit

Act Out 
(feat. Thi'sl)
[Verse One]
I'm loving life fam, we in the light man
Yeah that's right fam, another Christ jam
We get it hype man, I'm just a hypeman
Jesus the headliner, I'm just his hypeman
So get it right fam, It's not about your boy
But if you get the truth, holla at ya boy fam
My past was gritty and filthy like a trashcan
But through His blood, I'm cleaner than a snowman
This not a show man, but this for show man
At his wedding, he saved me for a slow dance
so I'm gon slow dance, down and narrow wit em
The whole way fam, like I'm hearing slow jamz
I sold program, this is program
Out wit the old man, in wit the new man
Follow the trails he left us like TuCan
Sam, 1 and 2, this one is for you fam
[Chorus]
If you walking down the streets
Or you ridin' wit yo top down
Reppin' on the front line
A soldier in the background
You face the trials of this world
And you don't back down
You hear the word of the Lord
And go and act out
You get down to the fathers biz
Want the whole world to know who Jesus is
If you loving the fact that Jesus lives
And the fact that Jesus is, Act Out
[Verse Two]
Let's keep it hype man, I'm just a hypeman

Like the Psalm that says word we delight man
Rejoice and we write man, all about Christ fam
Let's keep it moving
Don't get it tangled in everyday life, keep your focus on God's plan
Forsake the world's plan and the things that covet

The plans for us is to shed light like a summer man
Before cats get knock-ed off like duh duh man
[Chorus]

Yea that's right man, this that Christ Jam

Whether you walking down the street or at a light man
Sittin' in your room, about to make a right man

Keep your focus on God's plan
Because our life suppose to bring light man
To lead people out of the dark to the God man

Breathe In Breathe Out 
(feat. Lecrae)
Now Clap It Up, Clap It Up Clap It Up Now
Now Clap It Up, Clap It Up Clap It Up Now
Now Clap It Up, Clap It Up Clap It Up Now
Now Clap It Up, Clap It Up Clap It Up Now
[Chorus]
Breathe In
Take it in slow, let it work up in your soul
Take ya time and let it grow before you blow
Breathe Out
Let 'em know what you about from the words in your mouth
To the way you live it out no doubt
[Verse One]
Don't rock don't pop don't drop don't move
Just listen real close to what I'm trying to tell you
Its probably something different than what your used to
So let me break it down so the truth don't miss you
I learned a little bible was ready to take off
Armed with the truth but dropped the grace off
When everybody see me they ready to break off
I said to myself "Oh well, just stay lost"
Breathe In
But wouldn't take the word in slow
Lost the context that I heard before
Wouldn't meditate on the word I just go
Forget a commentary I got to save souls
They say wisdom is better than silver and gold
But I skipped that verse and I hit the door
Man they couldn't tell me nothing
Thought that I was on to something
And I was running all directions
Just a brother trying to gun it
[Chorus]
[Verse Two]
I was telling folks I know the spirit got my back
But I never picked the word up and read the facts
It was on now, I was in the zone now
Jesus had twelve well I was on my own now
People leave me alone now
Bout to get it gone now
But I fell flat upon my face I'm all alone now
Didn't have the truth in my sling
I was just trying to wing it
If it sound good I'm gonna say I'm gonna mean it
If its in the bible thats cool, I believe it
But I ain't really study so I couldn't really see it
See man you got to believe man
Now I breathe in, breathing out is so easy
[Chorus]
[Verse Three]
Last verse but I got a lot more to say
Got a partner named Jay from around the way
Breathe out all day but he wouldn't breathe in
He give the seed out but he wouldn't read man
And he told me theology was for them birds
And he really didn't need it when he read the word
Look left, Look right for a sign from God
But he didn't know the word was inspired by God
Telling people bout a couple funny things he heard
But the things that he heard they ain't match the word
If they don't match the word well they ain't true
Cause the bible is the final say on the things we do
I said Jay now, I understand how you feel
Man I love your zeal but you probably want to chill
He said Crae now, you can read all day
But I'm just a little different man that ain't my way
So I told him, how the word of God was true
How Paul was a Jew who would use the truth
of the Old Testament to make things clear
Thank God that day Jay turned an ear
Now he reading, reading, and reading the word
And his life look like what he see in the word
Matter of fact he don't ever want to leave the word
I'm trying to tell y'all that boy breathe the word!
[Chorus]
Now check this out y'all
I want y'all to keep it holy man
I know this beat sounds like one of them beats
That make you want to do something
You ain't got no business doing
You know what I'm saying, check it out
But lets try something a little different
Let me see
Do the once was blind but now I see
Do the once was blind but now I see
Do the once was blind but now I see
Do the once was blind but now I see
Do the hot, hot, hot, hot in the church
Do the hot, hot, hot, hot in the church
Do the hot, hot, hot, hot in the church
Do the hot, hot, hot, hot in the church
Now Clap it up, Clap it up, Clap it up now
Now Clap it up, Clap it up, Clap it up now
Now Clap it up, Clap it up, Clap it up now
Now Clap it up, Clap it up, Clap it up now

Fanataics 
(feat. Lecrae)
[Chorus]
I'm a F-A-N-A-T-I-C, Fanatic
I rep Christ till I D-I-E, Fanatic
I'm not extreme, I'm redeemed with faith
To serve a God whose extremely great
I'm a Fanatic
[Verse One]
The world's trying to tidy up, exfoliate they skin
but only Christ can come and exfoliate they sin
And they fate look grim, If they don't take him
As the high priest he is to mediate they sin
The world's got to many Gods, man we choose the one
From hebrews, he rules, he bruised his son
He moves the sun
So if we prayin and our schools call us fools
Cuz our God's too true to shun
Channels two in one
Man it looks insane
TV make a lot Christians seem dramatically strange
Though we may be looked upon as one and same
We will not turn in shame, we proclaim the name
Christ Jesus, believe us, you ain't gotta recieve us
but we gon' follow our God wherever the bible lead us
And you can call us dramatic, fanatic, emphatic
But hate while you at it, take a look at our mathematics
[Chorus]
[Verse Two]
What can I do to make it simple, make it plain
Christ came, emptied himself and let out sin hang him
You couldn't blame him for any sin
While they singing many men
The crucifixion was pretty grim
But when we state the fact that God resurrects
We get funny looks from a world that doesn't get
We are not David Koresh or Krishna
Or the people on TV who glorifying their bishop
From Edwards to Piper, MacAurther to Spurgeon
From Dallas to France, From Cali to Berlin
As Christians all over who getting the word in
We ain't crazy we just understand the truth and we burdened
The world sees us as evangelical Christians
As narrow-minded fanatics with a mythical mission
Labeled extremists for sharing out faith
But thats cool, we can carry the weight of persecution
Cuz earth is losing
And if we yelling the truth
We honored to be the people that our God is using
So keep it moving
Cuz if we yelling the truth
We honored to be the people that our God is using
[Chorus]
[Verse Three]
They thought Jesus was out of his mind
they laughed and mocked him
Called him a cult leader and they tried to stop him
Pharisees said Christ got his power from Satan
Hatin', on the very one that came to save 'em
Even after he rose, man the world ain't changed
They still rejecting the name, still look at us strange
Still tell us without shame that our faith's insane
and, "it don't take all that to be a Christian man"
And its hard when you tryin to reach your family and stuff
They say man, "you too spiritual, you doing to much"
So we show them the love of Christ and live in the light
So they can glorify our God when they look at our life
And we win for sharing the truth and hearts get changed
We win if we're rejected because of his name
We win if seeds get planted and watered and grow
But even if we lost, we still be Fanatical though

Verse 1:
You catch us in the long T's, fitted hats, it ain't suits that we wearin'.
Well how can we tell you Christian?  'Cause the fruit that we bearin'.
See, a seed was planted that produced salvation, we're filled with the spirit so we the bear the fruit of Galatians, man (c'mon!).
And when you see us, we ain't unwrappin' them switches (nope), we've been given the sack of forgiveness, we crakin' them scriputures, man (wooh!).
So you gonna notice we gonnna post with our life (post with our life!).
We stand on the word with boldness, 'cause we soldiers for Christ (we soldiers for Christ!)!
Look, we something like them dudes from 116.
We ain't ashamed, forget one mic, give me one more script (but I ain't ashamed!).
So I can begin to take the truth to the block.
Uproot the dudes that been duped, 'cause you can get loose on your rock (can get loose on your rock!).
But move to the rock, believe me, the truth'll hold ya.
We're wet with the living water, like a Super Soaker (a Super Soaker).
Who can hold us back?  It's a group of soldiers.
Lone on the Holy Ghost so you can lose the dozier (c'mon, c'mon!).
Chorus:
We ain't drinkin' licker (nope!)!
We ain't blowin' trees (uh-uh!)!
Our life has been surrendered (yep)!
We want to know he's pleased (c'mon!)!
But you might see us with the Cross on the block.
Posted, shining like diamonds, 'cause we glossin' the rock!  C'mon! (x2)

Takin' the gospel across the globe, the book of Acts is clurr (yep!).
Man, God is all around like the atmosphurr (fo sho!).

Impressed 
(feat. Tedashii)
[Tedashii]
ALL RISE, for the coming of the king of the Jews
Sixteen saints salute for Him bringin the truth
Hold up for a minute put your focus on Him
The selah for a second to catch more than a glimpse
Of the one placed higher than the angels in heaven
Pre-eminent so dawg that means He never comes second
Nothing should ever replace or overshadow this God
Ever reduce or lower his position as God
Man, He's holy, plus diving with all splendor
It's time Jesus Christ became your life's true center
The focus of your life so that your life be permanent
Pause
And peep this God that made the world and the firmament
Man, I'll put this on my momma, He'll blow that mind
Watch as I paint the picture for ya, its kodak time
If you ever wondered who He was, then no that now
No interruption take the sweets and heats and throw that down
[Chorus]
How can you hear about this God dawg and not get impressed?
The one that gave the sky its height and the ocean its depth
The one that hung all of the planets plus the moon and the sun
And let you hear this song that you might commune with the Son
[Tedashii]
So tell me what you seeing when you looking at God
Is it Yahweh the indescribable, unspeakable God
Or dawg, is it Elohim, all sovereign and majestic
The provident creator with a six day checklist
Or maybe the King of Kings up on the side of the Father
With nail prints in his hands cuz He decided to bother
Or do you look and see someone who ain't no better than you
Well if you the focus dawg I suggest you better your view
How you gon' act like you compare to Him?
You don't compare to the seraphim that cherish Him
Man, you got two lungs that still need air in them
The bottom line dawg, when you looking at God
You should see the king of glory not a midst or a fog
Not Father Time with the long beard and clock
and not this passive Jesus Walks that you hear in hip hop
But the God of the Bible Isaiah saw in Chapter 6
Who got a glimpse and said "God is Holy, I need to repent"
[Chorus]
[Tedashii]
Man, I've been looking for a minute how we impressed with things
Plus ourself, so we came to address this thing
We came to rep Him so dawg you would bless the King
And be impressed like Froto was with the ring
Like the Phanatik, take time dawg and think on these things
Think about how you're a sinner and you need to be clean
We sons of Adam fallen sinners and deserve to be killed
Man, we couldn't keep the standard cuz perfection His will
He is coming back for all of the cats
That allowed Christ to be they ransom and satisfy God's wrath
But, we'd rather think the bible's all about us
Instead of Jesus whom God said put all of your trust
Man stop coming up to God cuz you think He'll bless ya
Man stop coming up to God cuz you want something extra
Its time he impressed ya, and not because of all that He's done
But because of who He is dawg the Glorious One

In Ya Hood 
(feat. Tedashii, Trip Lee)
[Chorus]
Aww man y'all done messed up and let us in ya hood
To preach the way the truth the life in ya hood
Forget the 'lac with the steering wheel made of wood
It's time we see the truth of Christ in ya hood
[Verse One]
Aww man y'all done messed up and let us in ya hood
To preach the way the truth the life in ya hood
Forget the 'lac with the steering wheel made of wood
It's time we see the truth of Christ in ya hood
I'll never stop what I'm doing
Grooving moving for Jesus
Steady grindin in the streets just to reach all of my peoples
Momma, daddy, sister, brother, uncle, cousin and them
It's time we get it in for Jesus, start a buzz up for him
Man, but somethings always stopping ya, maybe your love for sin
Or the lack of love you showing when you cursing at men
Man how holy is he to you, how impressed by him are you
Is your life a story all about him or dawg does it star you
The answers your actions, the fruit of your passions
Plus the prove of the facts and who it is that you casting
Make a switch, change your role
116 became the mold
The word to the Colossians to know God is in control
[Chorus]
[Verse Two]
Hey dawg its T-dot, coming from the street block
Just to rep the chief rock, cause I think that he's not
In the place where he's got the chief spot
In ya life like the top
Cause life is all headed for the end like the sign that reads stop
It's ashes to ashes and dust to dust
You breathe in breathe out, then its back to the dirt
The fact of the earth is life is nothing more than vain glory
Your born, you suffer, you die, it's the same story
So come on dawg get closer to the life of this teacher
The preacher, savior, creator, our lord, king, and our leader
Of this holy culture movement, man we might insult when
You hear that to make it in you gotta go through him
Your a sinner, he's the Savior, your created, He's creator
But no matter how you spin it, you gone have to meet the maker
[Chorus]
[Verse Three]
It goes love, joy, hope and peace
My motivation for the ministry while hitting the streets
Man, we aliens, souled out on a mission fishing for heathens
Representing the kingdom, I'm praying that this truth can reach them
Like a telegram message that was sent through the wire
Or a Pauline Epistle thats divinely inspired
Cause all men need Jesus just like air to your lung
So in order to truly live dawg I dare you to come
Stop trying to do it yourself like McNabb on the run
Cause no man is worthy enough to compare to the Son
Or foot the bill for our sin that no money can pay
So all your good works now are worthless without faith
And, only Jesus Christ can truly free Pimp C
Even if he get up out of prison dawg he still ain't free
So remember without him we're a heartbeat from hell
Confess the name and rep him well before your heartbeat fails

I See The Lord 
(feat. Sho)
[Verse One]
Cast down my crown to worship you in spirit and truth
As I see You on the throne, I see Your train fills the roof
I'm on bended knees, hands extended closed eyes
Holy, Holy, Holy is Lord the Most High
Woe is me, I'm a man with unclean lips
And I live amongst a people whose on the same trip
That when one Seraphim flew to me with coal in his hands
He touch me on my lips, said I was a brand new man
As the foundation shook He's asking, who shall He send
I said, "Send me Lord, I commit to faithful men"
Sometimes Lord, I feel like I don't give you enough
The kind of pure joy to persevere when times get tough
So I keep a concentrated relationship fixed on you
I keep my eyes to the hills so I can have a right view
I stand in awe of You
How You measured the earth with the palm of Your hand
and yet, and still you want to be friends with such an unclean man
So like John I fall prostrate on this island of life
I worship You, recognizing you are power and might
Glory and light, eternal in sight, blameless and right
Creator of life, thief in the night, Jesus the Christ
[Chorus]
I see the Lord, seated on the throne, exalted
And the train of His robe, fills the temple with glory
And the whole earth is filled, and the whole earth is filled
And the whole earth is filled, with His glory
[Verse Two]
The sun suspends in the air
I can feel Your winds everywhere
You care to the grains of my hair
Divine works all around me
I can't get past the evidence
The fact that your invisible, to me, is irrelevant
I know your heaven sent, straight to the virgin birth
Gave me a second chance even after man's curse
A third, a fourth, a fifth, and a sixth
You wore my crown of thorns, you took my licks as they spit
In ya face, off the cross a sinner you embraced
Now I understand whats the meaning of grace
I war against the flesh, can't wait till the day that you come
Cause everday I'm rewriting Psalm 51
From the weak to the dumb
You make us shine like Pearls
Got a new engagement, broke up with that girl named world
The relationship was unfruitful, I was Satan's pupil
They told me you was an unfair God, I believed those lies
I know the truth now, cuz you've been fair since creation
Man fell, and then you gave man emancipation
I know the saying one sin can make man fall
But with one drop of blood, he can save us all
I'm a living sacrifice, I lay my life upon the altar
I pray to have faith that don't forsake you, like a martyr
I have a desire, thats to know you more
I have no choice to live holy cuz I see the Lord
[Chorus]
[Isaiah 6]
For Whole earth is full of his glory
And the foundations of the threshold tremble
At the voice of him who called out
While the temple is filled with smoke
I said to myself Woe is me
For I am ruined
Because I'm a man with unclean lips
And I live amongst a people with unclean lips
For my eyes have seen the king, the Lord of Hosts
Then one seraphim flew to me
With burning coals in his hand
He touched me on my lips
Said my iniquity is taken away, and my sins forgiven
Then I heard the voice of the Lord say
Who shall I send?
Who will go for us
Then I said
Here I am, Send Me

Love Song 
Where would I be if I never met your love
Can't imagine ever gettin up
Without knowin your grace how you placed me in your righteousness
I can't get enough
Unconditional love is what you show me
In a world so cold and lonely
And the life that I'm livin was givin not based on me
But based on the fact you know me
You... interceeded on my behalf
You... gimme everything that I have
You... never leave me alone my sins I been told
Cause you can no longer take on my wrath
You been so true so faithful
For your word I'm so grateful
Your love is true
And not what they showing on cable, and I'm
So in love with your righteousness I fight to just
Keep you in my sight for just
Five seconds of my life since the day I met Christ
Never knew a love quite like this, I'm writin this
With tears on my face you was there for my grace
Cause a father wouldn't hear my case
I was dead in my sins but you bled for my sins
That's the best kind of love anybody can taste
Only your love can save somebody like me
Only your love can truly set the whole world free
And I'm so in love
With everything about you Jesus
Only your love, your love, your love
Only your love, your love, your love
Verse 2 Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm Mmmm
Love me Lord you sho do
I done lied and cheated and cheated and lied
And treated the lies as if they was true but
Metaphorically you broke my legs
Like a sheppard does his sheep when it misbehaves
Not to hurt me but to work me
Into the man that you need me to be today, And it's sweet to say
Even when I'm doin back I'm good
Work for the Lord I'm glad I could
Tell me you would give the son and die for the sins of the world
My daddy would
That's a love like no other
Not my father not my mother not my sister not my brother nope not at all
Forget material things, I got every spiritual blessing in Christ
Eternal life, ya I got it all
Fall deeper in love with u everyday
No longer there so I know you hear me when I pray
And you show me your wisdom in many ways
66 books to keep me amazed
Only your heavenly love can manifest
In the death and resurrection
Your affection is sheer perfection
Divine election, you give me direction
Only your love can save somebody like me
Only your love can truly set the whole world free
And I'm so in love
With everything about you Jesus
Only your love, your love, your love
Only your love, your love, your love
Only your love can save somebody just like me
Was tempted just like me
But never gave in unlike me
I'm blown away
I never understood the kinda love that
Make somebody die for our world
Who doesn't even care that you cry for the world
Who doesn't care that you gave your life for the world
We do you dirty Lord, we not worthy Lord
Of your goodness and your mercy Lord
It hurts me that we remain to flirt with life that we got, to my Christ
So earthy Lord
Your love you know it rains
One day we'll see it plain
That to live as Christ and to die is gain
So keep all the fortune forget the fame man
We need the love of Jesus
Ha, that name Jesus
I could say it all day, I be in a daze
Your love is amazin like man Jesus
Your love's true and sincere
I reference you in fear
And as long as I'm around I'm down
To make sure the peopl hear
Only your love can save somebody like me
Only your love can truly set the whole world free
And I'm so in love with everything about you Jesus
Only your love, your love, your love
Only your love, your love, your love

Streets 
(feat. Lecrae, BJ, Tedashii)
[Chorus]
Hey we bring this to the street
Cause they ain't seen us in the street
But they need this in the street
Cause it's mean up in the street
We're redemmed of the street
That used to clinge to the streets
Till we saw our thirst wasn't quenched
By the scene of the streets
[Verse One]
Hey, this ain't aimed at the church but you might be incouraged
This is for the folks hurt on the block with the word
See ya playing in the dirt, hoping you can get the bird
Steady sippin on your syrup, wit a dutch full of burb
Let me tell ya what's gon happen dawg, this is why I'm rappin dawg
You catch time for the crime and then ya trappin dawg
Oh what's worse, is it could be your hers
6 feet up in the dirt, got yo baby brother hurt
Yea, a worse still when you die, gets real
You eternally separated from God for a trillian
Million, billion eternaty mayne
Ain't no number for it, this should be concerning ya mayne
Look, ya can't sleep cause ya sin so heavy
Ya sweating in ya sheets cause ya sin so heavy
Ready to die, naw, dawg, you ain't ready
You don't truely know what's on the other side young revin
Is sin equals death, so turn from your mess, believe and confess
Christ is God in the flesh, he died for your debt, he did resurrect
A tool and a vest won't really save you from death
[Chorus]
[Verse Two]
They never saw us coming, they had they heads turned
We faced the persecution, we know the led burns
We know them nails hurt, we know them thorns scared
We know our futures bright, but it ain't in the stars
We a new generation, who know the worlds hurts
And though we don't rock suits, we still part of the church
Our souls hurt too, our burdens hurt too
We want the Lord to be gloryfied on the earth too
We wearing dickies, yeah, but we still know the bible
We yelling like David was, ready to start revival
I know some kids in Dallas still in Jr. High
They ain't tryin to pimp girls, push work, or get high
Yea they jeans hangin low, and they keep they hat cop
But they living by the word instead of living by the block
Gettin trained a disciple, they changed all they idols
From juves in the streets to the God of the bible
[Chorus]
[Verse Three]
We done redemmed of the streets that used to clinge to the streets
Till we saw our thirst wasn't quenched by the scene of the streets
So we bring this to the street, they ain't seen us in the street
But they need this in the street, cause it's mean up in the street
Chasin cream up in the street, servin feinds up in the street
And the scream that they see makes them feind what they see
To be the man of the street, that's why we stand in the street
To tell the whole world about the stand of the peace
The god man of the street, slian lamb for the street
That came and died for all the sinfull people in the street
Through him the cycle of the street when man rival in the street
Could be revival in the street, take the bible to the street
Cause his bride should be the street, stop trying to be discret
Why you lunging men and women steady dying in the street
So we pray up in the street, man we stay up in the street
Cause we find our God heart, man it pains for the street

12 Meses Del ALo 
Mi vieja siempre me decia, la vida es como un juego
Los 365 dias del aLo ,los 12 meses, las 8,760 horas
De esos 365 dias un juego de la memoria a diferencia
De los animales de la selva que actuan, trabajan o
Respoden por instinto somos los unicos animales que
Actuamos ,por memoria y es que sin memoria mi hermano
No se puede vivir, anyway cada cual, decide como jugar
El juego de la vida cada cual que bregue con su tiempo
Y con su memoria...
En enero vi a todo el mundo con sus resoluciones sus
SueLos y con sus promesas de cambios vi como una madre
Divorciada tenia 2 empleos para lograr mantener a sus
Hijos y sacarlos a flote tambien a vi como mi pueblo
Poco a poco hiba perdiendo la tradicion de los
3 santos reyes.
En febrero vi como personas celebraban el dia de san
Valentin y se regalaban flores y chocolates cuando
Durante todo el aLo han sido hipocritas los unos con
Los otros.
En marzo, vi como una seLora le dispararon 12 veces
Para rovarle la gua gua, pero tambien vi como un niLo
De 7 aLos salvava a su madre en un accidente
Automovilistico.
En abril vi como confinados de una carcel del pais
Se amotinaron por las malas condiciones y el acinamiento
Y tambien vi como un ser humano se desangro frente a un
Hospital por la falta de empleados y equipo.
En mayo vi como un padre orgulloso por que su hijo
Se graduaba de cuarto aLo con honores habia sido
Admitido a una universidad en el extranjero.
Y Junio y Julio los meses de veranos unque no me crean
Fui a mDs funerales que a festivales playeros y vi a
Madres llorando en la funeraria, coronas y derramando
Lagrimas de cocodrilos...
La calle esta mala mi hermano...
En agosoto vi como las clases comensaron y vi,escuelas
No tenian libros, vi chamaquitos sin uniformes maestros
Descontentos un sistema educativo completamente inselvible.
Yo vi miedo..
En septiembre vi un hombre que acesino a su esposa y se
Suicido dejando a sus hijos huerfanos,
Tambien vi un funcionario del gobierno que era
Encarcelado por cargos de corupcion.
En octubre vi como una familia era desauciada de su casa
Construido en terrenos del gobierno, vi como un vecisno
Mio era despedido de su trabajo por razones politicas,
En noviembre vi como una familia celebraba el dia de
AcciNn de gracias con una oculenta cena cuando
Deverian de dar gracias a Dios son todos los dias
Cuando vi diambulantes no tenian na que comer
Nada por que celebrar y en diciembre cuando algunos
Estaban celebrando vi una madre preocupada por que
No tenia dinero para comprarle regalos a sus hijos
Y vi otra madre llorando por que era la primera navidad
Sin su hijo acesinado y en el fin de aLo mientras
Los petaldos sonaban vi a un niLo en el suelo
Desangrandose por culpa de una bala perdida
Personas preparandose para comensar el nuevo aLo
El mismo cuento distintios dias.
Este fue un leve resumen de los 12 meses de un aLo
De 356 dias y con el pasar de los meses me eh dado
Cuenta que pertenezco a la raza mas violenta del planeta
Y asi como un tigre no mata otro tigre nosotros deveriamos
Tomar el ejemplo y no matarnos los unos a los otros
Asi que lucha comparte y vive en armonia este es
Gallego en los 12 Discipulos.

Censurame Por Ser Rapero 
Yo! Ja!

Tirando la verdad!
Dirigido...
Pa' esa gente de la alta sociedad!
Jaja!
O mejor dicho...
De la alta suciedad!
Je!
E-D-D-I-E!
Muchos me miran como si yo fuera un tipo sin arreglo
Como si nunca antes hubieran visto un negro
Como si fuera un delincuente
Como si con el lapiz y con mi libreta yo matara gente
Y cuando me asomo
Hay un par que lo piensan pa' darme plomo
Pues tengo que joderme pa' que mi noticia sea publicada
Y si mato a alguien, rapido me dan toas' las portadas
Y no me mires mal, cuida tu actitud
Yo solo soy un portavoz de la juventud
Un guerrero ante la adversidad
Y soy mejor que la mitad de la Universidad
Y cuando arranco, no tengo pausa
No importa si me dicen, rebelde sin causa
Firme como piedra
Y confio mas en un tecato de Santurce
Que en un juez de Monte Hiedra
Tal vez mi musica no sea sana
Pero yo no me invente ni el sexo ni la marihuana
Pal carajo los que nos critican
Esta es la musica con que los jovenes se identifican
(Censurarme por ser rapero!)
(Es como censurar un pueblo entero!)
A mi no me importa, si te gusto o si te disgusto
Pues mi diploma de 4to aLo esta firmao' por un corrupto
(Censurarme por ser rapero!)
(Es como censurar un pueblo entero!)
No me hables de lo justo ni de lo injusto
Pues, mi diploma esta firmao' por un corrupto
La gente quiere hacer un issue de una cosa tonta
Sera por eso que tenemos tanta gente en contra
Como los del Senado
Pero es bien facil hablar mierda sentado
En aire acondicionado
Como puLeta vo'a hacer algo positivo?
Si todo lo que veo es negativo
Si hablo mis vivencias
Dicen que promuevo la violencia
Ppor lo visto la democracia es a conveniencia
Nos han puesto un sello, pero
La mayoria de nosotros somos mas gente que ellos
Diganme, a que rapero de esta Isla
Lo han acusao' de las puercas que han acusao' a Misla
Y hay tiraera en mis canciones
Pero no tanto como en la campaLa de las elecciones
Se acusan de corrupto, el otro dice que esta mal
Y total, al final, terminan robando igual
Hacen promesas pa' tu vecindario
Cuando ganan nunca vuelven por tu barrio
Por eso no confio, soy un tipo listo
Mi voto solo se lo doy a Jesucristo
Y esto es pa' los que se pican, los que se agitan
Los que nos utilizan cuando necesitan
Y aunque me salga caro lo que disparo
Voy a seguir enviando el mensaje claro
(Censurarme por ser rapero!)
(Es como censurar un pueblo entero!)
A mi no me importa, si te gusto o si te disgusto
Pues mi diploma de 4to aLo esta firmao' por un corrupto

Enguandome las bolas estuve como una hora pa sacame to'a la sal
Mi lado una muchacha en bikini y borracha k tambien se iba a enguagar
Al notar k yo era wiso tiro la toalla al piso y se dobla sin pensar
Yo me puse a mirarle la nalgota y la chochota y esas dos grandes tetas
Con el frio y con la brisa casi casi me hipnotiza la cabrona taba quebra
Acabo de enguagarme, sacudirme y de secarme y empiezo a caminar
Yo voy rascandome las bolas frente a mi una culona jalandose la colilla
Cansado de la playa algo me jala la toalla no sabia k era
Yo pense que era una palga habia sido que una palma se me habia quedao encajaa
Cambiando el tema vuelvo pa la nena (x4)
Bajate el pantalon subete la mini,
Quiero ver tu g-string o tu bikini
La ke tenga panty e vieja ke lo tire a wipi
Mientra nosotros los maliante nos fumamo un filling
Asi ke cojan el idioma ke mejor dominen

Supuestamente ahora todo es diferente,
Y le venden a la gente,
Que el prejuicio quedo a la izquierda.

Se creen que ganan mucho al aconsejarnos,
Sin saber que ganarJan mucho mas al escucharnos.
Djenme vivir,

Y si en verdad gente quiere que yo cambie no me reproche.
Mejor ore por mJ en las noches.

Yo no me humillo ante los gringos.
Ni me cogieron con setenta kilos en Santo Domingo.
Ni me invente los cigarrillos ni los wisky.
Ni puse a mamar a Monica Lewinsky.
Yo no trato a los pobres como animales.
Ni dejo morir la gente en hospitales.
Yo no mande boricuas pa' donde Husein.
Ni le dije rata a Freddy ValentJn.
Yo no vote por ___.
Ni le dije a los policJas que esnuaran a la menor en la celda.
Yo no le robe la tierra a los tainos.
Ni le niego los papeles a los latinos.
Yo no cerr ni el ___ ni el \"hawaian\".
Ni le presenta la nena a Kobe Bryant.
Yo no mezclo la leche con la magnesia.
Ni manipulo las personas en la iglesia.
Yo nunca he dicho que la juventud esta perdida.
Ni le robe el dinero al instituto del sida.
Yo no caso parejas del mismo sexo.
Ni maltrato las visitas de los presos.
Si de algo soy culpable,
Es de vivir sin importar lo que la gente hable.

Fire In My Eyes 
At this point I've lost control
Falling farther in my hole
It will take, more than, you know
Till this day I'm walking tall
Just cause I know I've lost it all
I am fading away
I find myself looking down
Over my own soul
Will I ever get to know
The better part of me.
Still I don't, know what it's for
Cannot take too many more
Of these pills, they make, me sick
Forever I'll be the same
There is no one else to blame
But myself, 
I am the only one
I find myself looking down
Over my own soul
Will I ever get to know
The better part of me.
And I know I'll find peace today
The fire in my eyes
Will I ever get to say
Go Away
I watch myself
I'm living a lie
I seem to falter
Even though that I try so hard
So with this kiss I walk away
It will be gone today, today
I find myself looking down
Over my own soul
Will I ever get to know
The better part of me.
And I know I'll find peace today
The fire in your eyes
Will I ever get to say
Go Away
I watch myself
I'm living a lie
I seem to falter
Even though that I try so hard
So with this kiss I walk away
It will be gone today, today

Heavy Hearts 
What is in front of you
Yet you still turn away
I call out your name
Everytime you lie
Your fading faster
We want to help you
But you must ask us first
So, please believe, forget everything
That I've, heard before
Cause it's not me(it's not me), I'm not like this
If only, you could see
Falling farther inside
And you've forgotten now
Everything you were before
And do you really even try
To stop yourself from
The death of you
You are wasting away, So
Please believe(please belive), forget everything
That I've, heard before
Cause it's not me(it's not me), I'm not like this
If only, you could see
Look inside the mirror friend and tell me what you find
If you don't see the ugliness than you are blind
Cause you've fallen too far, you won't wake up! 
Shaking, unmoving I hate you for this
Leavin behind, all of us
Selfish, and fucked up you've ruined everything
You have only one chance, So
Please believe(please belive), forget everything
That I've, heard before
Cause it's not me(it's not me), I'm not like that
If only, you could see
All we done(All we done), it's for you
Although, you are gone
Cause you wasted(you wasted), so much
Of everthing
For you, we cry tonight

Who's the next radical
Keep me fed up with the same old get up
What's enough for me is enough for you
And you're leaving town to get a new tattoo
Make it mega bright for you
Future is bright for you
I meant to get away
Dent in history
Religion
To heal the incision
Loud and clear
Your actions speak so loud and clear
Yesterday so fresh and new
You can't decide what is fresh and new
'Cause sarcasm has got the best of me
When the future looks bright for you
See my image on the TV screen
It's actions speak so loud and clear
It'll give you what you want
But what you want is drilled inside your head
Don't listen to me I'm just a hypocrite
A victim of this simple circumstance

lies beneath my toes

that deep in mexico
there's a voice
that's all her own
stolen goods to find
from deep inside my mind invited
breeding ground of shame

Mr. Whipple 
Here's a little story about Mr. Whipple
Thinking about how he'd like to buy a motorcycle
Trying to run down all those fickle people
People squeezing Charmin
Don't be afraid of Mr. Whipple
Then he came across a very fine lady
Goes up to her and says "Hey Hey Hey Baby
Let's go down to the deli
Where I can rub that big old Whipple belly!"
He's got the paper that surely won't grind
When you go to the store he's the one you'll find
When you leave the store he's the one you'll miss
You'll want to give Whipple a big old

I know things deep inside of me 
The excitement that I swallow 
I swallow things that I can't see 
I know you're right behind me 
But I'm too dumb to turn around

Am I the stupidest boy in town

Can you see my mouth open wide 
Lopsided and confused 
The dead weight of my left arm 
And already sold that you will refuse 
Substance dream mechanical failure 
My little lost boy trying to sound

Am I the stupidest boy in town 
Pain is good if I had understood 
Stuck with weight that's hard to hide 
Numbness disappears when you are near 
Nicky, take me for a ride 
Your daddy is smiling at me 
White horses flowing through his veins 
Impossible eyes, forgotten future 
And enough angst-ridden guilt to go insane 
A walk together, a walk that hurt 
A road I didn't know and soon forgot 
I wake with my left arm numb 
He's not with you, will you be with me

Stuck with weight that's hard to hide

sea of tranquility
i've thrown away the key
your secret's safe with me

Hunt Of The Unnamed 
This desert landscape continues forever
Mountains in the distant land
I've continued on this quest for only god knows how long
Hate and love the reasons i go on
Hate for the monsters that did this to me
Love for my family they took away
My only friend teela marches along
Toward their ever-nearing death
On and on we go
'til we catch up with those monsters and the carnage can unfold
On and on we go
Catch up with those fiends
Extract the blood they stole
I only count the day by the grains of sand i see
The night by my chilling memories.
My only hope is that one day this quest will cease
And the pain will leave my body free
That dark night often plays out to me
I hear the screams of my dear family.
The last look that my wife gave to me
So much pain, for this they will pay.
On and on we go
'til we catch up with those monsters and the carnage can unfold
On and on we go
Catch up with those fiends
Extract the blood they stole

3 Leaf Loser 
Biting the hand that feeds you, lying to the voice
Inside, reach out to beg for something this life
Is a lesson, take what you're given feeding on
Self destruction, waiting to explode again, no
Sign of resolution this life is a lesson, take what
You're given
You don't need direction to find your way, don't
You listen to yourself now and again killing
Time, killing you mind over matter, stop and 
Listen to yourself now
Bend me before i breakdown, dying to be free
Within, it's not how you'd like to see it this life 
Is a lesson, take what you're given forcing your
Self solution as you fall into line again, when
Will i find the answers this life is a lesson, take
What you're given
Falling to the ground, left face down as i recall
The mirrors ugly glare

You say you know just who I am
But you can't imagine
What waits for you across the line
You thought you had me
But I'm still here standing
And I'm tired of backing down
And I'm here now feeling the pain
Of a thousand hearts
Been to hell and back again
I won't take this
You try so hard to bring me down
You can't break the broken
You still don't seem to understand
It's your turn to see just
How it feels to be me
How it feels to be knocked down
And you're here now feeling the pain
Of a thousand hearts
You've been to hell and back again
You can't take this
Remember
This feeling
How it feels to be alive
Now you see me through my eyes
And we're here now feeling the beat
Of a thousand hearts
Coming back to life again
We can make it
Remember

Arms Of A Stranger

Couldn't wait to hold you
I've been away for so long
But as I walked through the doorway
My heart was shattered
To find that your not alone
When will I break
Into pieces
It's your mistake
I finally see that
Everything I thought was you was a lie
Now you left love dying
It's in the arms of a stranger
The days just seem so much longer
Now that I'm without you
It never seems to get better
I'll try to hold it together
And I can't wait for
The day that you fade from my memory
When will I break
Into pieces
It's your mistake
I finally see that
Everything I thought was you was a lie
Now you left love dying
It's in the arms of a stranger
In the arms of a stranger
In the arms of a stranger
When will I break

Bitter 
Mother mother can you hear me, i keep trying
Just to find me all i know now, all you s how me,
Endless questions, hopeless ending
This bitter pill is pushing me away and now i feel
Like there's nothing left to say and i pretend to 
Look the other way but in the end will i be okay,
Will i be okay
Father father will you be there as i cry out
Silent again turning colder, frozen deeper,
Numb to this dream sleeing within
Before i face another day, won't you let asleep,
Lost among the dreams that always comfort me
And before i find my feet, won't you show me
What i need, what i need to walk again

Alone again again alone
Patiently waiting by the phone
Hoping that you will call me home
The pain inside my love denied
Hopes and dreams swallowed by pride
Everything I need it lies in you
Cause I'm broken 
I know I need you now
Cause deep inside I'm broken 
You see the way I live
I know I know your heart is broken
When I turn away
I need to be broken
Take the pain away
I question why you chose to die
When you knew your truth I would deny
You look at me
The tears begin to fall
And all in all faith is blind
But I fail time after time
Daily in my sin I take your life
All the hate deep inside
Slowly covering my eyes
All these things I hide
Away from you again
All this fear holding me
My heart is cold and I believe
Nothing's gonna change
Until I'm broken

Time, moves slowly while you're gone
I haven't heard your voice in quite some time
But I still see your face
I cannot erase the things you've done
And all the ways you kept me hangin' on
Now your gone
I've moved on
And I don't feel so sorry
Can't you see I'm bleeding
But I won't bleed anymore
I've held on
For so long
But I had to let you go
At the end of our broken road
I know, it hurts to hear the truth
Well maybe
I was never meant to be with you
And I cannot replace
The tears of disgrace
That run for you
Cause running from the truth is what you do
Now your gone
I've moved on
And I don't feel so sorry
Can't you see I'm bleeding
But I won't bleed anymore

Crash 
As I lie tossing in my bed
Lost in my fears remembering what you said
And I try to hide the truth within
The mask of myself shows its face again
Still I lie time and time again
Will you deny me when we meet again?
And I feel like I'm falling
Farther every day
But I know that you're there
Watching over me
And I feel like I'm drowning
The waves crashing over me
But I know that your love
It will set me free
As I find truth where I found it times before
As I search for your hope
I'm finding so much more
And I try to be more like you
And I deny myself to prove my heart is true
I hear your voice calling
The time has come for me
Inside this life I'm living
There's nothing left for me
My mind is slowly fading
So far away from me
Each time I start crawling
You're there watching me

Far Away 
Something keeps on pulling me down
And I feel like I'm losing ground
Trying just to find my reasons
And losing sense of what is real
Willing to believe in something
Forgetting to believe in me
Will I find my place in your mind
Or will I fall away in time
[Chorus:]
Now I'm feeling so far away
And now I'm hating you every day
Waiting just to see the image
You follow down my road again
Trying just to find your purpose
You're fading faster every day
Willing to believe in something
Forgetting to believe in me
Will I find my place in your mind
Or will I fall away in time
[Chorus]
Now I feel I'm losing time
Yesterday slipped away
When you didn't know
Time and time again you wanted more than I had to give
To leave me with nothing
I'm waiting and dreaming
Yesterday slipped away
When you didn't know
And no more waiting
Let me back

(Now I'm feeling)
So far away

And I'm so scared of all the ways
You take my confidence away
With all the games you play
All the selfish games you play
I don't know why
And I don't know how
I let you control my inner self
As cold as you are
I'm counting the scars
They're proving to me just who you are
Now I know why now I know how
I'm better off without the
Selfish things you say
And I won't waste another day
With all the games you play
All the games you play
And I'm so scared of all the ways you take my confidence away
With all the games you play
All the selfish games you play

Hey Love 
Looking back on everything I've done
I never thought I'd find the one
To share the dreams that only I had seen
Locked in the deepest part of me
I took a chance to lay it on the line
There was nothing left to hide behind
If you never love then you may never lose
And I hope I'll always be with you
Now I'm screaming
Hey love won't you leave your touch
On this heart that's broken
I can't breathe when you're not here
Hey love won't you lift me up
On the wings that fly higher than the stars
That shine above
Thinkin back on everything we've done
We watched the waves drown the sun
We shared a dream that both us had seen
And we made it our reality
We found a way to stand the test of time
All of our doubts were left behind
If you never love, then you may never lose
And I hope I'll always be with you
Well I'm screamin'
Hey love won't you leave your touch
On this heart that's broken
I can't breathe when you're not here
Hey love won't you lift me up
On the wings that fly higher than the stars
That shine above
If darkness should fall upon our hearts
Remember the dreams from the start
Hey love won't you leave your touch
On this heart that's broken
I can't breathe when you're not here
Hey love won't you lift me up
On the wings that fly higher than the stars
That shine above
I can't breathe when you're not here

Home 
In my eyes you see the pain
With each lie I take the blame
With each sigh I slowly fall away
You are there when I need you
You sew me up when I bleed through
The endless cloth of lies surrounding me
Everything that I am you have given me
The lessons that I've learned are bringing me home
It's everything that I need
It's all the truth that I believe
Right where I need to be
Just bring me home
I hide in darkness blind to sense
Chasing a dream with false pretense
Help me find the fracture in this dark sky
Everything that I believe is slowly overtaking me
I'm just trying to find my way back home
Endless days are haunting me
Open eyes and I can't sleep
I need this now rescue me
Just bring me home
You can't bring me down 
Cause I'm going home
It's everything that I need
It's all the truth that I believe
Right where I need to be
Just bring me home
Endless days are haunting me
Open eyes and I can't sleep
I need this now rescue me
Just bring me home

In Closing 
Step back inside the lie again, you'll find you're 
Wearing thin
Killing the sympathy as you take another swing 
At me now
Fighting your inner self again, losing what
You feel
Shielded behind the lies that make you feel real
Now
It's over and i don't feel a thing but you're
Trying to break the scar again your spirit is
Bleeding as you grin but your bridge keeps on
Burning at both ends
In your mind, the ending seems to be so far from
What you need
Take back the memories as you smile to hide the
Pain from me now
Shut down the curiosity that brings you here
Again
No sense of purity as you try to take the life
From me now
Nothing that you ever say could ever possibly
Erase
All the hateful things you did and now i'm
Through with you nothing you could ever say
Nothing you could ever say
Hope you're happy now

In My Head 
I'm reaching out without a sound
My pride falls to the floor again
Inside my mind I search to find
A place just to call my own
Deep inside your eyes 
I am blinded by your love
Still I run so far just to find that
I'm alone again
In my head
I hear you calling me
And I can't run cause there's nothing left for me
When I fall you always follow me deep inside
Deep inside
Deep inside of my head
I just can't last as these feelings pass
Once again I hide the pain inside
The smile wears thin and the lies begin
To bring me down again
When I run I run so far away from you
I hide the pain and all the lies deep inside again
And all my faith I put in you
This time you take it all away 
Inside my head
Deep inside 
My head

It Was You 
It was you
That showed me who I am
And taught me how to stand
For what I know is real
I was sick of all the pain
Tired of all the shame that I felt
But you showed me a way
To never have a doubt
And always to believe in myself
Now I see
It was you
That showed me who I am
And taught me how to stand
For what I know is real
Now I'm breathin for the first time
And I'm leavin, all this behind
I've become, what I am because of you
It was you
I'm so sorry 'bout the ways
ut I can't take away my past
But you love me anyway
And now I wanna do
Everything for you that I can
Even though it won't erase
The foolish things that I've done
Things that blinded me
But now I see
It was you
That showed me who I am
And taught me how to stand
For what I know is real
Now I'm breathin for the first time
And I'm leavin, all this behind
And taught me how to stand
For what I know is real
So how can I make this up to you
I'll fight and I'll push and I'll strive
Can't you see
It was you
That showed me who I am
And taught me how to stand
For what I know is real
Now I'm breathin for the first time
And I'm leavin, all this behind
I've become, what I am because of you
It was you
I can see the writing on the wall
As time begins to crawl away from me
And I've become what I am
Because of you
It was you

Lie To Me 
Our candle burns away
The ashes full of lies
I gave my soul to you
You cut me from behind
Nowhere to run and nowhere to hide
You're scared of the truth, I'm tired of the lies
Cuz who I am, is where you wanna be
Don't act like an angel
You fallen again
You're no super hero
I found in the end
So lie to me once again
And tell me everything will be alright
Lie to me once again
And ask yourself before we say goodbye
Well goodbye
Was it worth it in the end...
You said you were there for me
You wouldn't let me fall
All the times I shared with you
Were you even there at all?
Nowhere to run and no where to hide
You're scared of the truth, I'm tired of the lies
Cuz who I am, is where you wanna be
Don't act like an angel
You fallen again
You're no super hero
I found in the end
So lie to me once again
And tell me everything will be alright
Lie to me once again
And ask yourself before we say goodbye
Well goodbye
Was it worth it in the end
Why'd you have to up and run away
A million miles away
I wanna close my eyes and make believe
That I never found you
Just when I put my guard away
It's the same old story
You left me broken and betrayed
It's the same old story
Don't act like an angel
You fallen again
You're no super hero
I found in the end
So lie to me once again
And tell me everything will be alright
Lie to me once again
And ask yourself before we say goodbye
Well goodbye
Was it worth it in the end...
Lie to me once again
It's the same old story
Lie to me once again
It's the same old story
Was it worth it in the end...

Desperate and waiting, frozen to the core, numb
To this feeling, needing something more all  i 
Keep thinking is where i need to be, all i can hope
For is someone to take me away
Before you go you promise me something, i need
To know will you leave me lifeless leaving me
Lifeless
Will i bow down to this life that i live, will i find
Freedom or lose it all again all i keep thinking is
Where i need to be, all i can hope for is someone
To take me away
Before you go you promise me something, i need

Something again

Open Your Eyes 
When I look into your eyes 
I see a lot of hate
Pushing me away
You're haunted by a past
A past that brings you down
So you throw it all away
Again
Just try to find a place deep within your soul
And don't deny the child living deep inside
Open your eyes and find 
This life's better than you know
It's in your hands now
Just open up your eyes
Deep inside of your mind
You're forced to believe
That nothing's gonna change
So I take you by the hand
And I lead you to a place
A place of happiness

Believe
You fall deep inside again nothing left to see
Weakness fills your heart again you put it to
Rest
Forfeit everything because you were never
Strong enough
Close my eyes again and pray that life will not
Give up
I try to see your face again a photograph for me
Your voice calling out again nothing left for me
You try to find your place again waiting just to
Breathe
Weakness takes your heart again you put it to
Rest....locked inside again
Did you forget about the things i said 
Fight the lies inside your head
Deny those who try to bring you down
Kill the pain and emptiness
Find a love and lose yourself
Without this life you're just a memory...locked

Running Out Of Pain 
As he raises his hand you begin to understand
That no love is worth the hate that you feel
Now you're running out of pain
And all these feelings feel the same
So you close your eyes and wish it all away
And I lie awake and I try to say
Anything I know just to ease your pain
But you hide away where no one can see
And it's only you that can set you free
Now the time has come again
So you reach deep down within 
To find the strength that you have buried there
As you turn to walk away you can still hear him say 
You'll never make it in this world alone
You try to fight (you try to fight)
You hide the pain (you hide the pain)
You walk away (never again)

Every morning as I wake to another day
I bow my head hit my knees and I begin to pray
I search for answers that I wonder if I'll ever find
Running circles in the mazes deep inside my mind
You always take me to a higher level
Show something that's deep inside
You show me things I never knew
You push me you pull me
You set my soul on fire
You take me so much higher
Higher again
Thank you for it all
Everyday living this life not knowing what it means
Consolation from above fulfilling all my dreams
And as I look across the crowd in their eyes I see
All their troubles and their pain staring back at me
You always take me to a higher level
You show me something that's deep inside
You show me things I never knew
You push me you pull me
You always give the best for me
Lift your hands high right where I can see
You always give the best for me
Lift your hands high right where I can see

I'm sorry for needing you to carry me
So simple sometimes when you're standing next
To me
You never change you never stay the same
Like a picture perfect sunrise every time with
One last song to sing
Take it all away from me and tell me how you
Want this to be
I want you i need you
A life without you made me wonder why i'm here
Until i found nothing ever seemed so clear
You never change you never stay the same
Like a picture perfect sunrise every time with
One last song to sing
I lose myself in everything you say i lose myself
In everything
I never knew that i could feel this way i never
Knew that i could feel

The Way I Feel 
Lately I've been wandering
Off the narrow path
You've given me so many things that I've never had
And all in all I know it's you that always pulls me through
If you reach deep inside you'll see my heart is true
Cause I hate the way I feel tonight
And I know I need you in my life
Yes I hate the way I feel inside
And I promise to make the sacrifice 
The world I know is pulling me
More and more each day
I feel like the odd man out as I begin to pray
Spiteful eyes are watching me
With everything I do
In the midst of darkness Lord
My spirit calls for you
(You know sometimes deep inside)
I feel like this

This Dark Day 
I'm flushing the pills
I've lost all my will
This has been haunting me way to long
And I can't rewind
I'm the suffering kind
I've been abusing way to long
I'm breaking
Suffocating
I'll close my eyes and I'll drift away
I'll make it through my darkest day
And I'll sing this song at the top of my lungs
Until this dark day is done
Now I'm trapped in the wake
Of all my mistakes
I've been under for way to long
I sit and I shake
My heart starts to race
The poison lingers in my veins
I'm fading
Suffocating
I'll close my eyes and I'll drift away
I'll make it through my darkest day
And I'll sing this song at the top of my lungs
Until this dark day is done
You said I'd never change
You said I'd never had the strength
To break away
But now I've changed
It's time to turn the page
And walk away
It's time to walk away, it's time to away...
I'll open my eyes and I'll stay awake
I made it through my darkest day
And I'll sing this song at the top of my lungs
Now that this dark day is done
I'll open my eyes and I'll stay awake
I made it through my darkest day
And I'll sing this song at the top of my lungs
Now that this dark day is done
Now that this dark day is done

Waiting For Yesterday 
It's a long way back to reality, she puts another
Brick in the wall of shame she made so long ago
Trying to figure out where things went wrong
Searching through all the lies she told
Somehow she missed out on all the things that
She needed most days spent wondering why this
Life is so cold and nothing ever changes
Screaming for attention, watch the sun steal
Yesterday
Hiding all emotion far away
Trying to find his self confidence, another 
Broken heart behind the painless smile that he
Shows reminded that yesterday is so far gone
And tomorrow is still a miracle somehow he
Missed out on all the things he needed most days
Spent wondering why this life is so cruel and
Nothing ever changes
Tomorrow's still a miracle

World So Cold 
It starts with pain
Followed by hate
Fueled by the endless questions
No one can answer
A stain
Covers your heart
Tears you apart just like a sleeping cancer
Now I don't believe men are born to be killers
I don't believe this world can't be saved
How did you get here and when did it start
An innocent child with a thorn in his heart
What kind of world to we live in
Where love is divided by hate
Losing control of our feelings
We all must be dreaming this life away
In a world so cold
Are you sane? Where's the shame
A moment of time passes by
You cannot rewind
Who's blame and where did it start
Is there a cure for your sickness, have you no heart?
Now I don't believe men are born killers
I don't believe the world can't be saved
How did you get here and when did it start
An innocent child with a thorn in his heart
What kind of world do we live in
Where love is divided by hate
Losing control of our feeling
We're dreaming this life away
What kind of world do we live in
Where love is divided by hate
Selling our souls for no reason
We all must be dreaming this life away
In a world so cold
There's a sickness inside you that wants to escape
It's a feeling you get when you can't find your way
So how many times must you fall to your knees
Never, never, never, never, never do this again
It starts with pain followed by hate
Now I don't believe men are born to be killers
And I don't believe this world can't be saved
What kind of world do we live in
Where love is divided by hate
Losing control of our feelings
We're dreaming this life away
What kind of world do we live in
Where love is divided by hate
Selling our souls for no reason
We all must be dreaming this life away
In a world so cold
In a world so cold

Break Up Letter 
If I told you one day,
That I would never hurt you.
That I would be a promise I can't make
If I told you someday, 
That this could be true love forever.
I'll wipe that smile off your face.
If I made you cry 1000 times
would you still take me back
and I miss you
and I swore to God I would never miss you
if I told you I'm ok
and all my friends are doing great without you here
this letters so impersonal she said
the words just seem to pour right off the page
this is your break up letter
I lied when I told you it's not you that it's me
this is your break up letter
I'll set you on fire just to see the colors you could make
If I left you here for six long years
your washed up you feel used
are you jaded
and I pray to God you don't hate me
if I say I'll be home soon
a broken heart and an empty room is all you'll find
with a letter in the middle of the floor
the words just seem to fall right off the page
I try to scream but somehow I can't breathe
this is your break up letter
I lied when I told you it's not you that it's me
this is your break up letter
I'll set you on fire just to see the colors you could make
So tell me
so tell me what you're thinking
cause I can't read your mind
so tell me
so tell me what you're thinking
it's hard to see things clear
behind your blackened eyes
and I could make things right
if all the stars aligned
a different place a different time
cross my heart and hope you die
the words just seem to fall right off the page
I try to scream but somewhere I can't breathe
I know I made my share of mistakes
but you were the worst one
the worst mistake I ever made

Night To Remember 
This could be a night to remember, but you still give me nightmares I'll never forget. Im sleeping with the lights on tonight so before you go, Ill tell you what Im thinking. Do you really want a one night romance. Are you dreaming of a starlight slow dance. Do you really want a storybook ending, move on lets stop pretending now. Im anticipating, all these phone calls youre desperately making. Im dying from the sound of your voice. Before you go, try to stop the bleeding. Ill leave the lights on so you can find your way back home. When you get here all of these doors they will be locked closed. Do you really want a one night romance. Are you dreaming of a starlight slow dance. Do you really want a storybook ending, move on lets stop pretending. Do you really want a one night romance. Do you really want a starlight slow dance. Do you really want a storybook ending, move on lets stop pretending. You always ask me where we went wrong. It must have been the day that I wrote this song. Get up 
&
 get out, I think it's over. Get up 
&
 get out, I think it's over. Get up 
&
 get out, I think it's over. Life is full of regrets put on your shoulders. Theres a whisper in your left ear loud and clear. A casual conversation. Let me know, are you dialing the phone. Do you really want a one night romance. Are you dreaming of a starlight slow dance. Do you really want a storybook ending, move on lets stop pretending. Do you really want a one night romance. Do you really want a starlight slow dance. Do you really want a storybook ending, move on lets stop pretending. I need you like a hole in the head. Im thinking that Im better off dead than spending one more night with you

Perfect Love Song 
Turn those headlights off and lets not make a sound. Whisper in my ear how much you want me around. If you wanted to tell me how much you would miss me when Im gone. Now would be the time. This could be the perfect love song if I wrote this song for someone else. This could be the perfect love song if I cared how you felt. You say its all my fault that you spend your nights alone, cause every time you called me I was never home. Well maybe Im with your best friend laughing at your imperfections or the stupid things youve said. This could be the perfect love song if I wrote this song for someone else. This could be the perfect love song if I cared how you felt. If you wanted to kill me slowly, tell me youll be mine forever. If you wanted to kill me slowly, we could spend our lives together. Ive been waiting, just kill yourself so I can move on. No more wasting time. Ill cut your throat so you wont sing along. This could be the perfect love song if I wrote this song for someone else. This could be the perfect love song if I cared how you felt

If I had known all these roads had led to you
I would of crashed this car
now I'm leaving you with all this sorrow
and send me your very best

you said that you would die for me
I know it's hard but try the best you can
I'm past the point of telling you I'm sorry
and telling you things will be alright
and I'm past the point of giving you my heart back
a segway to another sleepless night
you said you lie awake
and cry yourself to sleep
while lying in my bed
so I'm asking one question and I'll try to make it brief
do you care if I'm alive or you're dead
you said you would die for me
just wait a while I'm sure you'll get your chance
I'm past the point of telling you I'm sorry
and telling you things will be alright
and I'm past the point of giving you my heart back
a segway to another sleepless night
the wait is over,
say good bye to what you had
and I'll miss you
it's all those quiet things that no one talks about
it's over, it's over
it's so over
always and forever, I'll miss you more than ever
I'm past the point of telling you I'm sorry
and telling you things will be alright

All I really want is to lay gently down beside you
That's the part I miss the most of all 
After she left me
And maybe it's not fair to touch your hair 
&
 think about her
But I know no other way to ease the pain 
&
 heartache
Forget about it...
Hey you wanna hook it up 
You never say enough 
And I can't figure out 
Just what you're all about 
I need to understand 
Am I in your future plans 
Or just a one-night stand 
Come on and let me know   
You wanna hook it up 
You never say enough 
And I can't figure out 
Just what you're all about 
Done everything I can 
To be your superman 
Yeah I'm your biggest fan 
Come on and let me know 
You wanna hook it up 
You never say enough 
And I can't figure out 
Just what you're all about 
Done everything I can 
To be your superman 
Yeah I'm your biggest fan

This Is It 
Eddies got a walking stick
But he doesn't move, to fast
Every time he goes outside
He's taking a ride, with me
And Johnnys got a rocking chair
And all of his hair, I swear
And reading is his favourite way 
To spend his time, all day

Hey
This is it
This is it
This is it
Betty was a movie star 
And I'm on gaurd, tight flicks
And when she tells you all about
You better watch out, that's it
Loretta wet her bed last night
But that's alright, I said
She kissed me as I pulled the shade
But then I waved, goodnight.

Hey
This is it
This is it
This is it
Nonnie fell and broke her hip
It's harder to skip, these days
The sleeping occupies your time
After the wine, settles in
Margies in a produce pile 
Shes been there awhile, all night
She's digging for the perfect plum
With a bottle of rum, that's right
(x4)
Hey
This is it

The ether was wearing off. The acid was long gone. But the mescaline was running strong. Good mescaline comes on slow. First hour's all waiting, and then about halfway through second hour. You start cursing the creep who burned you because nothing's happening. And then...
Come on now, let's all take some mescaline!

Karma 
* [Prolouge]
Karma
What goes around comes around right? (right)
How you treat people is how they treat you back
Disrespect them or knock them
They gonna slap you back (yer)
Sometimes it hurts
And thats bad karma
Watch out for it
[Chorus]
How am I supposed to live in a world of negatives
How am I supposed to love in a world full of push and shove
How am I supposed to breathe in a world full of lust and greed
Well I guess I'll have to live day to day
and pray to god that'll I'll be ok, ay ay
[Verse 1]
These fat raps think they fit like they The Iron Man
I got the iron tounge and the iron hand
I make the final stand
The final showdowns come round and hit ya
As I throw down my gauntlet so switch the picture
If ya, look in the mirror you bound to get a reflection
Like with, every action there is a reaction
with your, dodgy actions you causing negative drama
And if you know gods law you best watch for karma
Now I'm a bomb ya
Running your traps like tacks
You think you floating on the cream
You and your rat pack
While I'm take that thought back now lets dwell
How I should lock you like jail cells so we can exhale
I'm a bull and (you's a matador)
I'm seeing red
(You outta swords)
I'm a target like
(Dartsboards)
You floating in space like astronauts
I started off last but now I'm first while ya shakin I cut off like
umbilicals at birth
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
I look around the city and its all such a pity
everybody trying to be pretty don't care for nitty gritty
I look around the block nobodys playing hopscotch
there to busy on the internet surfing that rap
[Verse 3]
Just converse kind of rude like
(so what you trying to prove mate)
I say, (nothing I'm just trying to build the feeling I live like you)
I got plans to take this city up to senate
As lifes one big race and want all entrys to win it
If your not with it, like quitters then get out of my face
You got no place in my grace with your grimace
Your a disgrace with a desire
You need to recon through your fire and look higher higher! look around!
I got sounds that help you get down so you can get up
But oh boy i'm sick of raps that get me fed up
Yer they make me wanna throw up cause they gotta grow up
But well I'll be feeling a beard and I'll be Sailing like NOAH
[Chorus]
[Interlude 1]
Melbourne.....To Sydney......To Brisbane...Darwin.... To
Perth.....Adelaide.... Tassy
And all Across the OZ..Z..I..E...
[Verse 4]
Picture on the quota its time to roll
I will continue like part two with no to and fro
Aiming at infinity, start a nasty road
had to leave the poor luck souls before they fall so
I got a key to the door and I'm searching for the keyhole
And when I unlock the door I'm bringing love to my people
unlike these Fickle Fanatics that wanna cause death
cut holes flake praying we fall to hells depth
As I watch and see all our progress regress
as what goes up comes down never the less
We're stung by the horror, cold hearts with armour
boomerang effect as we all face our karma
[Chorus]

Bathing In Hate 
I used to care until you showed me how weak I was
I used to care until my eyes filled with hate
I used to think I had the one thing that never died
I found the truth to late
Bathing in hate
Til it wash over me
Bathing in hate
Til it covers me
I used to be so much more than this
I used to be the one with open arms
I used to know who I could trust
Dreams to dust
Bathing in hate
Til it wash over me
Bathing in hate
Til it covers me

Replay Today 
The face I wear today
Will soon fade away
And the dreams I have made
Will die where they lay
Call it cowardice for not seeing it til the end
Show you these open wounds I've got to start to mend
Trust is not my friend
As faith walks out again
Unwilling to bend
The strength I need ascend
Let my weakness carry me I cannot fight alone
Show me every single fault and turn my heart to stone
Replay today
I never wanted to be blind
Replay today
I didn't want to be this kind

State Of Mind 
Look into my eyes and you will see
The way your thoughts should be
Listen to the tone of my voice
And understand you have no choice
This is the way it will be
All your days with me
I don't understand what you hope to gain
You always know it ends in pain
Your eyes open wide
With your back against the wall
Keep your lips shut tight
Like a good little doll
Your state of mind
Will fall in line
Your state of mind
Will fall in line
With time
I've said the same thing since the very start
That we will never be apart
I've held your hand and I have held it tight
Even when it trembled in fright
No one knows the truth like I do
That everything is caused by you
You bring it on yourself so dry those tears
No one hears
Your eyes open wide
With your back against the wall
Keep your lips shut tight
Like a good little doll
Your state of mind
Will fall in line
Your state of mind
Will fall in line
With time
It's you and me until the end
You and me until the end
You and me until the end
It's you and me until the end
Your state of mind
Will fall in line

Strength 
Don't see what you do
And I haven't for so long
Where is this wealth of inner resolve
This foundation you think I stand upon
Where is this strength
You say lives inside of me
So I can lift my eyes once more
And be who I should be
Where's my strength
Jackhammer pounds the mind
You're nothing without me
Hearing these words echo through my head
This twisted, distorted image stands instead
Where is this strength
You say lives inside of me
So I can lift my eyes once more
And be who I should be
Where's my strength
I can't see
What you see in me
So how can I believe
That what you see
Is me

The Lesson 
I heard every word you've said
Even if my eyes were closed
I felt every statement you made
Even when you chose not to speak
Look at what I have become
This pathetic shell youve constructed
I am your living legacy
Broken, battered, bruised, by your love
I've learned my lesson well
I sing it in my sleep
You and me till the end
I've learned my lesson well
I cry it in my sleep
You and me till the end
Why can't you look me in the eyes
Does it frighten you to see yourself
I can see how that would cause you pain
I've felt it everyday myself
All at once it seems so clear
I don't have to be trapped here
I can pick up my pieces and walk away
From this shattered life you've led for me
I've learned my lesson well
I sing it in my sleep
You and me till the end
I've learned my lesson well
I cry it in my sleep
You and me till the end
You're nothing without me
I'm nothing with you
I am who you are
I'm better than that
You have no place to go
Anywhere but here
Who else would hold your hand
Then let me go
Take my pride
Take my faith
Take my trust
Take my dignity
I've learned my lesson well
I sing it in my sleep
You and me till the end
I've learned my lesson well
I cry it in my sleep
You and me till the end

i see the tables turning
they turn with speed
i watch the fire burning
burning to the sea
i heard a holy story
i laughed out loud
a man who chases the wind
never should be proud
they can always find a way
to pull you down
make you feel so small invisible
another sent to take the final part of me
give me my lesson for today, (i can't hear you)
fill me with hope and quickly betray
when i am barely breathing
they come for me
i wish i never saw them
walk all over me
they can always find a way to pull you down
make you feel so small invisible
another sent to take the final part of me
give me my lesson for today, (i can't hear you)
fill me with hope and quickly betray
it's my fault
i should have never trusted
it never fails
to bring me down
so hear me out
always busted
you got yours
guess i got mine
your high score
my waste of time
give me my lesson for today, (i can't hear you)
fill me with hope and quickly betray
give me my lesson for today, (i can't hear you)
fill me with hope and quickly betray

Erase 'em All 
Building the walls around it
Created self with nothing much
Without a cost to find it
Feeling avoid and losing touch
The borrowed taste his novelty
Could be a product of another's humility
Don't worry your loss wil be his gain
He wouldn't hesitate to turn his back on you
And it might be true
Erase 'em all - Don't worry boy
You gotta rise to fall befoer you know the motto
Erase 'em All - Don't worry boy
You gotta rise to fall before you know you gotta
Erase 'em all
The warning's out it's gonna come to an end and I
Hate to see him label me as a friend tonight
Never question my intentions without the right
Showing me another way to turn his back on you
And it might be you
Erase 'em All - Don't worry boy
You gotta rise to fall before you know the motto
Erase 'em All - Don't worry boy
You gotta rise to fall before you know you gotta
Erase 'em all, Erase 'em all, Erase 'am all,
Erase 'em all
Erase 'em all, Erase 'em all, Erase 'am all,
Erase 'em all
You wanna stay you'd better run
When I catch up you better have a gun
I'm so wound up from playin' dumb
This time it's real and real isn't fun
You never saw this side before
Don't test the water for what's in store
I drew the line and I learned a rule
What's good for me isn't good for you
Erase 'em all
Erase 'em All - Don't worry boy
You gotta rise to fall before you know the motto
Erase 'em All - Don't worry boy
You gotta rise to fall before you know you gotta
Erase 'em All - Don't worry boy

Jimmy 
Jimmy
It started out with a few misfortunes
His daddy ran off with some broad from the motown
When momma said we're leavin tomorrow
Jimmy already had his things together
So many days of thinking of the past
The girl he left behind and hangin out in the
free streets
Somehow Jimmy had survived his reflections
The broken glass in his hands, a noose before him
Said he did it before
He's gonna do it again
Give him a fix and a bottle and he won't complain
Until he's blue in the face
Jimmy's the leader of a losin' race
Hey Jimmy did you learn your lesson
You always know what you were missin'
Hey Jimmy did you solve the problem
Just a kid with no direction
Some people say it was fright that drove him
But Jimmy knows who's really scared of difference
The whipping boy won't take his beating
It only left them alone to their thinking
Of how he knew what they could never know
And he would live and learn to be himself
through his mistakes
Watch and laugh, pretend they were okay
Waiting for things to change is just another day
Said he did it before
He's gonna do it again
Give him a fix or a bottle and he won't complain
Until he's blue in the face
Jimmy's the leader of a losing race
Hey Jimmy did you learn your lesson
You always knew what you were missin'
Hey Jimmy did you solve the problem
Just a kid with no direction
Hey Jimmy don't you walk away
We'll look at life according to me
You're my life support auto biography
Hey Jimmy take a look inside
Let's take a chance, enjoy the ride
Impressions don't die
No one knew your story
Hey Jimmy did you learn you lesson
You always knew what you were missin' (Jimmy)
Hey Jimmy did you solve the problem
Just a kid with no direction (Jimmy)
Hey Jimmy did you learn your lesson
You always knew what you were missin' (Jimmy)

Every face sing we had to happen, every
face is you
Every smile that I force on someone sends me
to the edge
Coffee breaks I take because, I need more
time to clear the fuzz
Take me back twenty first street
Troubles times that I find myself in, double
without you
Such a lose that I try to replace sends me
to the edge
Living breaks I take because, I need more
time to get a buzz
Take me back twenty first street
I think I'm losin', losin' my mind
Just anyone means nothin's done just yet
I need my time to heal
Just anyone is next to none without
The reasons I could feel - Just anyone
All the times that we tried to make it
Now those days are through
All the times we were forced to fake it send
me to the edge
Coffee breaks I take because, I need more
time to clear the fuzz
Take me back twenty first street
I think I'm losin', losin' my mind
Just anyone means nothin's done just yet
I need my time to heal
Just anyone is next to none without
The reasons I could feel - Just anyone
Spending hours trting to find myself-
Redemption, wrong direction
No more power to control my - Isolation no solution
Every voice that I know is not the same
Every word taht I read calls out your name
So many days looking for you but in vein
A losin' game and I'm to blame
Just anyone means nothin's done just yet
I need my time to heal
Just anyone is next to none without
The reasons I could feel
Just anyone - Just anyone means that I can't
afford to face the facts
Just anyone - Just anyone means that I can't

Lightshow 
Wish I could stay but I gotta run
I got some miles to go and no destination
And like you've never seen, my light is always green
The ice is melting and the bitch ain't helping
I sink the eight-ball from the cue, before you
know I'm through
With blurred validity I can see you in me
Put in my hand a hundred proof I'm bad
Is this the same wine that Christ permits to dine with
Can't part with
A light show, a shadow, through these eyes
everything looks too clean
I make it to brake it
From the bottom the top will always spit you out
Spit you out
My thoughts aren't set in stone and I'm committed
to go where few have
ever roames, and through the klgiht show I witness
the unknown
Put in my hand a hundred proof I'm bad
Is this the smae wint that Christ permits to dine with
Can't part with
A light show, a shadows, through these eyes
everything looks too clean
I make it to brake it
From the bottom the top will always spit you out
I've been drinking to my health
Gotta get off me, get away from me
I've been sinking to my hell
Gotta get off me, get away from me,
I've been living for myself

Outside Looking In 
Somebody told him that their way was the right way
He never took a chance, her never had a
chance
Cause he was force fed he had to live his
death sentence
See, he was a new face with a nice smile
He got sucked in got spit out
He was the winner by the standars of gold-digger
A success story in six figures
Outside looking in
It was wasted life on the dream
Outside looking in
He was wasted
Turn your back to the world
So then he grew old, he thought he grew wise
He thought he'd know a bad seed in swarm of flies
They couldn't wait to consider him family
Take what they could get and keep walkin'
And on his death bed surrounded by his friends
He saw the faces and no substance, let go
With a smile of serenity, he needed change for enternity
On the outside looking in
It was wasted life on a dream
On the outside looking in
He should of seen their dream as a sin
On the outside looking in
It was wasted life on the dream
On the outside looking in
He was wasted
Turn you back on the world
It's what he didn't know, he didn't know that killed him
It's what he didn't know, he didn't know that killed him
It's what he didn't know, he didn't know that killed him

Pick Your Poison 
Running from yourself like you're stranded
And now you're exactly where
You never thought you would be
In the dark without a light to guide you
What once was a breath
Is now a gasp to survive
You left so much behind
So many questions unanswered
The other side
The crash to the burn
The fingers that picket
For your solid satisfaction
Belong to the hands
Wrapped around your neck so tight
[Chorus]
You live today, Without a care
Tomorrow will come and I'll still be here
I gave myself to you and you left me with lies
And there will come a time when you have so much
But there's so little that you can touch
And still I consider you a friend
For every temporary sucker
That's in place
That you need
Is another cry
For you to return
You've been there
You've been square
But nothing in between
Now it's time to find those
Who are looking for you tonight
[Chorus]
It's hard to accept
But there's people that don't care
In a world so cold
And they seem unfair
But you've got to realise
You have a purpose
And it's not through your nose
That you can see the light
When I was scared
You picked me up
You told me never to forget
That I'll be there by your side
So here I am
We've gone too far
And it's been a long time
Since we've been at peace
We followed a part
But I still know
That behind the mask
Is a familiar face
It's you

You watch and know
Unspoken not forgotten
As one we've grown
And sometimes soft,
So soft could penetrate a rock
You know we
Got to make it

Got to find it, we see in you
The word on the street is not the same as it
used to be
(Will you still know me when I'm gone)
The word on the street is strong and it surrounds me
(Will you still hate me if I'm strong)
And what's in store
Get into character for
Allegiance sworn
A sufface aquisition
Maybe an allusion, together still
Our selfish route together
Not taken by another
No shoes to fill
The steps that we're taken are not to be mistaken and
yah there's fear
but waken to get up to find maybe it's better
to spin the gear
Got to make it, see to it, straight through it
Got to find it, we see in you
The word on the street is not the same as it
used to be
(Will you still hate me when I'm gone)
The word on the street is strong and it surrounds me
(Will you still hate me if I'm strong)
The word on the street is strong, speaks for
itself, belongs to no one else
(WIll you still know me when I'm gone)
And I'm calling on all of you, we've paid our dues

Scared Away 
Somebody once said
Stop when the light turns red
I know the story
But I don't want the glory
Cause when you're shot down
You're gonna hit ground
But they don't feel it
No they won't heal it
I've given everything
I've played the name game
I sent my get well cards
And never got an answer
Don't want my money back
These cards are not stacked
And I don't need it
I won't believe it this time
I won't believe it this time
No I don't need it
I won't believe it
This bridge is your's to burn (this bridge is your's)
No room for more
Can only offer what you've been shaking under me
Fakin till you see what's wrong with me
Can I get close enough
So you can hold me up
And tell me over and over
I went bad again
I'll tell you one thing
Without a promise ring
That I don't need it
I won't believe it
When it's down to this
I get oblivious
I see you looking
But you don't wanna see a thing
Being so scared
Can't get you anywhere
And I don't need it
I won't believe it this time
I won't believe it this time
No I don't need it
I won't believe it
This bridge is your's to burn (this bridge is your's)
No room for more
Can only offer what you've been shakin under me
Fakin till you see what's wrong with me
See what's wrong see what's wrong
See what's wrong with me, what's wrong with me
Me looking at you, you looking away
And I'm wondering how the one I know had changed
Me reaching to touch someone
But you're gone, tired now
Scared away somehow
Scared away somehow
This bridge is your's to burn (this bridge is your's)
No room for more
Can only offer what you've been shakin under me
Fakin till you see what's wrong with me
This bridge is your's to burn (this bridge is your's)
No room for more

And you're drowned in illusions
And you're covered in your shelters

Still you don't work enough to make it yours.
You're tired of this routine
But you don't make a change
You're afraid to make things worse
An now that your life is gone
And you've missed the starting gun
You begin to think about this chance you've lost
Now that the sun is gone
And you can't find it no matter how you try
You begin to believe that your life is done

Irish Song 
Wake up in the morning and have a couple beers
I guess it's how we hide our hurt, that's better than tears
We have our nights of getting rowdy and getting fucking drunk
Going to the bar and putting dead guys in the trunk
Everyone's got an Irish song and now so do we
We just couldn't help it, it was our destiny
Lucky Charms and Guinness, sure sounds good to me
Everyone has an Irish song so why shouldn't we?
Some people tell me Tom, you drink to fucking much
Everytime that you guys play you use liquor as a crutch
Well I say, fuck you!
Don't you worry about me
Gin, whiskey, jagre, beer is how I keep my sanity
Lucky Charms and Guinness sure sounds good to me
Everyone's got an Irish song so now so do we
I'll beat you with my shillelagh
Your neck belongs to me
Everyone's got an Irish song so now so do we

Morning's here again, but I'll just stay in bed
I think I'd rather sleep the day away
Things have been worse before
I guess I can't complain
Just another day of doing what I love to hate
Time is a cruel thing, it never waits for me
The more I think about it, the more my life is pissed away
Cause I've spent most my time, looking for some answers
I should just shut my mouth and take my fucking chances
It's in you, it's in you, it's fucking inside you
And Danny is crying again
Life is a moment, I can't forget today
Waste it all, wishing it was yesterday
Cause when I sing these songs, everything's okay
Jack up that stereo, we'll make it through another day
It's in you, it's in you, it's fucking inside you

Ghostwork 
hour hero yes, had showed you there'd be days like this...
and you find yourself longing for a certain drastic context
a dreadful circumstance that will tack great lengths onto
your dictionary definition
to soothe your leaden understanding of bread, water, and money
now arriving by an alternate route at where the absence
of such things might leave you
mind you, this is not more rich confession of a child actor
and as you would agree completely with a gift cyst as it appeared in your throat
the decision to further limit the pain registrar
and delight your tiny heart a moment with uncontested omnipresence will...
you've had the wind knocked out of you by something life size
and you're afraid to say to your face
you stretch the pen and cheat the sleep
this sort of evening you want to say something your words cannot
note: which leaves your ghost blowing up globes
tying them off with an x axis c-clamp
and setting them down
for 7 days and 7 nights
you've sewn a cloth copy of your nervous system
to a turtle neck and pair tuxedo pants
outside the city's dry all covered in primer
you have lost control of your hair
yesterday you were shot for a magazine cover
fatigue swapped your body build with all urge and by the door
you heard demo's creaking squeezing a squeal from your guilt
against the clinging teeth of their cd-tray
all beneath the inner half of the door knob
hissing at its other head
hung in the sun
you're staring at a quill as the lump sum of its parts
and it's begun to look brutal
4 walls of day: and that alone
no empty hallway for you bearing the
100 bright light blocking doors of luck
and here in the favor of life i will
contrive no device against expectation, only announce
i have learned to respect the color yellow
for one reason or another.
and in the insurmountable non strength of one's weight

Your ghost blowing up globes 
tightening them off with an X-axis esque c-clamp
Then setting them down through the clouds 
onto empty department store shelves.
Where they sit faving all sorts of islands
out toward bead wee-hour isles
has the earth come loose from its galactic neck beneath
you. Let go from the space surround it
cut off above the clouds
dropped down done to the sun syestem's floor
crooked pearl of the one universe
cleaved, tell rolling toward a corner of the cosmos
in the blacked and quiet of some time
"and you are all lamb, for this."
Spring is at your back again
this time rare with your calrity. . .
while patches of you thought whole
had turned up still.
made a tar of your woe
and flesh where in
Have you gone half dead. . . 
yet. . .yet have you to let the worst most be
as if it were atlas to your world of cope.
And no one is out there scared you'd set your eyes off on the ceiling

you on the ledge of all 241 ways to be you...basing guess upon guess
there...where...somewhere between motivated and cold
believing your good friends down to the bile in their beautymarks...
they who found you counting back toward yourself
so haven't dreamt and heavily armed
yet another blues thief told in however and oneday...
and every monday things begin with indiscriminate street noise
more vague and normal alliance of all those with high levels of work
in their blood and clock in their wake
up early shaving damp breakfast skulls with fresh lady's leg razor
so that the oneday the moon might hold a half million nice size
hoods easy
and plenty fast restaurants
by cum and by egg
and laid low into creature
then
cast out in the one cold of all names,
this song is about disabowed sperm
and the mining of human concern
many cells split, many men died in 1998
the year of my strong, fair rap collection
there are foot prints embraced far out on the frozen lake face
depressed and kept from quite some cold ago,
and they look brave, dangerous, man made
the sort of mark one can make on the world
you borrowed the camera from why
and set it up over by the printer and horsehead
obsessed with your pressing record
to indulge in the shadows of both here and immortal
is it god to name things from thin air
to have the wind blow a few hundred dollar bills into your wallet
to have 100 cc's liquid luck supplement
dug into your blood
by needle point and distant star
are you busy losing yourself
in the quiet cell of abandoned old oakland
pants undone, stole eye starting to water
nailing a sign that speaks fear to a bank at the man made lake
you cop you
will you now resort to black umbrellas in the sight blanching sun
or stay indoors taking the pill to your face...
striking that lightning on nothing
attempting to teach yourself the art of cloning at home
in a smock killing single cell sheep for straight weeks
'til you give it all up for photoshop and using your teeth
there in a box with your things, stabbed airholes, and one wing
or white lung, when your well will you stay
since there is a certain modern earth pain only fit for enduring
which one does endure
like returning a foster child twice or
going the distance on songs for somebody else's compilation.
no one's out there scared you'd set your eyes off
all night on the ceiling in the dark
think of a song or maybe breasts
i thought i told you, this is not new...
skinned by the speed of my one life
you have the desperate fair to your eyes
the look of a child who has just swallowed a coin or army man
almost too attuned to the spoils of loved
wishing he'd been born some sort of succulent or larvae
but you're too soft for all that
you like your blood kept in the movies
and your head in a jar or a vase in a van on tour
your guts clumped like dung in a sturdy hatbox
heart slung safely in the stomach of a clean sock or two
here you are a bag of milk to do tricks
and not as a function of pennies
and how you've dreamt
nosdam's skull been predatored

Ti mentirei spudoratamente dicendoti che non ne vorrei almeno a fiumi. 
E se tu mi reputi intelligente sai che tra questa gente oramai 
sei considerato un nullafacente se non hai almeno un conto 
in banca con tanti contanti. 
"E' un mondo difficile. Felicit? a momenti e vita incerta" io vigile su quello che ho, 
perch? ogni giorno 
? incredibile il numero di uomini che farebbero di tutto per fottere me o il prossimo. 
Non resta che diventare pi? rabbini degli altri, pi? scaltri, 
rubare perfino le caramelle ai bambini. 
Dici che sono cinico ma il caso ? clinico, credimi, 
Non basta applicarsi al minimo per restare in bilico, vedimi. 
Questo ? tutto quello che posso dirti lo so, 
ma la fuori non ? rose e fiori ? il manicomio. 
Per questi dannati soldi elicotteri in cielo e carrarmati in terra.

Demoni 
Strofa 1 (Domasan):
Esseri umani mettono anime in vendita
Almeno cos? ? di norma/ siedi e guarda/ c'? da assistere con calma
Potrei immaginarmi che vengano a cercarmi, per leggere il mio karma
Usarlo come arma per minacciarmi
Paranoie per noi/ nate per noia/ per spaventarmi
E poi la pioggia ed il vento/ il fuoco e gli stenti
Il gioco di giudizi, interventi
Preferenze e privilegi che ostenti
Vite intere/ sofferenti alla ricerca del migliore offerente
Il respiro sar? la mia armatura/ resto indifferente
Vedo demoni ed angeli leggere vangeli
Promettere che si va in cielo
Quando l'assenza di sole sulla terra porter? il gelo/ non permettere
Altrimenti ti danno anatemi
Che stendono al suolo e provocano danni
fonemi/ pesanti come atemi
la fuori ? desolazione
attimi in cui si ? costretti a firmare contratti
atti con i quali illuminarmi/ come astri
distratti da illusioni/ catastrofi
ascolto suoni/ stabilisco tempi
uso contrasti per continuare a scrivere testi
sfidando i miei disastri quando prendono forma
metamorfosi di frasi e storie in strofe
non rimane che rimuovere scorie/ fare brillare diamanti
vibrare corpi come navi nella tempesta/ scosse da correnti
ci hanno convinti a stare bene con pasticche di estasi
tenuti seduti con pasti caldi
conditi con sedativi a grandi dosi per curare nervi tesi
crisi d'astinenza crea astio/ bisogna uscirne illesi
non rimare che rimettersi in cammino sull'asfalto
non posso ancora accontentarmi/ ? troppo presto
lo spazio intorno/ troppo vasto
perch? intanto mi tengono in tensione
dietro volti sorridenti leggo l'intenzione
intimidirmi con l'intensit? della loro azione
so come comportarmi/ mantengo l'attenzione
devo controllarmi/ confrontarmi
tengo alto il livello di stamina
contro i nuovi mali del duemila/ formidabile
non rimane che rimare.
Ritornello (Domasan 
&
 Paura):
L'unica cosa che so/ che devo fare il rap
Angeli/ demoni mettono anime all'angolo/ come pugili
L'unica cosa che ho/ le rime che porto con me
Promettono/ mietono vittime/ prendono cuori e vite fragili.
Strofa 2 (Paura):
Non ? certo troppo facile guardarsi indietro, ma alle volte ? necessario, 
quindi quando rendo il vento fermo iberno i fin troppi pensieri neri, 
tagliandoli in tavole e agli angoli del ring sono schierati un angelo e un diavolo. 
Il troppo bene e il troppo male estremizzato e forse ? il mio stato allucinato 
che ha annullato il divario. 
E' normale che in queste condizioni non conviene neanche lontanamente 
prendere in considerazione il risultato. 
Oramai sono abituato a fare l'arbitro con l'abito sporco di sangue 
e rido in faccia ai concorrenti, anche se so che corrono senza freni, senza favole: 
ma la minchia mi scoppia se fanno i sensei. 
Ogni loro alunno cresce deviato come un neonato che ? stato adottato a vita 
da una coppia di gay. 
Oramai non si evita pi?: 
questo millennio forse vedr? la clonazione alla nascita per il ricambio degli organi umani. La legalizzazione di tutte le sostanze stupefacenti, 
e pi? che fattanze vedo veleno su un tavolo. 
Gi? lo senti che certe cibarie sono identiche a droghe sintetiche. 
Quando si confondono l'estate e l'inverno, si propongono soluzioni antitetiche. 
E in eterno noi siamo fottuti da dosi anestetiche. 
Se apri quelle cazzo di palpebre lo vedi che in giro ci sono anche fin troppi uomini strani. 
Alcuni insegnamenti sono studiati per manipolare le menti 
e le mie risposte nascoste tra gli elementi. 
Piani correlati ad anello. 
Demoni di metano e di plastica con tatuata la svastica e falce e martello.
Un monaco tibetano me lo disse che, oltre la facciata, nulla ? pi? considerato un tab?. Vien vien cu'me. Ma soltanto quando, in primis, tu vien vien cu'te. 
Sono fiere materializzate dalle rime sul mio quaderno 
e pi? che Ulisse nell'Odissea, 
mi sento un cavaliere dell'apocalisse che vola sulle ciminiere, 
quando schiere di soldati alieni offuscano il cielo come l'eclisse. 
Non sono le risse ne il governo che decidono adesso al mondo 
chi cazzo detiene il potere. 
Sul teleschermo immagini di guerre in terre straniere, 
ma per lo pi? non credo a quello che viene trasmesso in tv. 
Ho smesso da un bel p? di stare appresso alle cazzate che abbiamo attorno ogni giorno. Orami so che conviene passarci in mezzo indifferente, 
la differenza con prima ? che sono molto pi? diffidente. 
Non mi vedrai mai in compagnia dei comitati a cui ti affidi, 
sono afidi che si attaccano alla tua mente, sfiaccano la tua gente 
e alla fine ti lasciano in ipocondria. 
Avviati alle olimpiadi di chi ama l'anarchia ma sembra adesso uscito 
da un programma di Mtv. 
Mentiti finch? vuoi, se vuoi dimenticami.
Ricami per il tuo identikit oppure vai m?.

Strofa 3 (Paura):
Rimango io l'oblio e la strategia, lento ma prendo progresso che vendo. 
Altro che pariamiento questa ? pura follia,
questo ? l'avvento come il messia, ? un giorno nuovo e m? si dia il via 
all'era del flusso e dalla stratosfera, 
tredici in possesso dei codici d'accesso. 
Ridotto all'osso, inizia la primavera perenne. 
Prima era indenne ma adesso l'hip hop in agonia per me ? un ossesso. 
Lascia la scia del successo e trova armonia. Con me sempre pi? spesso. 
Per te ? tab?. 
L'epidemia inizia dalla grafia mia su un foglio del mio menu. 
Non c'? compromesso, ? poesia. 
Precauzione per la feccia 
ed i cloni coi loro emblemi. 
Sciami di scemi, milioni che si intrecciano come le frecce che sfrecciano 
sui vagoni dei treni. 
E' una magia, le emissioni ? quello che temi. E cos? sia. Soluzioni per i problemi. Inesistenti le proporzioni, tu non ti opponi. 
E tra i perdenti addirittura c'? chi si svia. 
Interi contingenti di contendenti, armati di oggetti contundenti. 
Pane per i tuoi denti. Per me oramai ? una mania. 
Per ogni loro gesto una eresia, e sono in fuga come i conigli. 
Consigli dalla regia, lavori di fantasia ma rimani in balia delle onde 
prima che tocchi le sponde della realt?. 
D'altronde ? la mia fonte d'energia che confonde i motori, li manda in avaria. 
Asfissia e non c'? luce all'orizzonte. 
Pensavi di stare sulle corazzate dei russi? 
Le tue restano cazzate pure se ne smussi gli angoli. Manco li vedi passare i miei flussi. Solo arrestandoli avanzi di categoria. 
E poi testandoli capisci che si tratta gi? di antologia. 
La sacrosanta verit?: tra noi due non ci sar? mai sintonia. 
Non ? l'assenza di gravit? che alza quintali. 
Spinti oltre la sfera dei venti in prevalenza da correnti ascensionali. 
Per gli incompetenti eventi sovrannaturali, noi coerenti a degli ideali. 
In queste cose vai avanti soltanto se vali, validit? a vita, 
i movimenti delle dita dei djs: fuochi artificiali, no replay. 
I breakers fanno danze tribali. 
Mcs stregoni col dilay. Vitalit?. 
Idoneit?, predisposizioni naturali. 
In queste discipline ti imbatti in guerrieri senza rivali, trattasi di imbattibilit?!

Strofa 1 (Callister):
La magia viene da un vicoletto stretto 
dove c'? un ciuccio con il carretto un cioccio a cobretto. 
Come i tiri di Maradona con l'effetto, 
stai fottendo con il mostro finale lo hai detto! 
Come per una mossa speciale rotazione, 
stai fottendo con Callister il ciclone! 
Temperatura a mille la capocchia fa scintille mentalit? 
da macchinista struttura da terrorista 
sgancio missili terra aria fottono lo testa 
i ciocci abbassano la cresta. 
Macchinetta lesta la mia mascin ha la sesta, 
rimani dietro come nesta.
Basta che la storia di merda si tasta 
e la gente di merda ? rimasta!
Strofa 2 (Dj Gruff):
Ma che ne so arriva un tipo e mi fa: 
"vado bene di qua, sto venendo di l?, 
e ho pensato che lei mi potesse indicar 
un piazza provvista di pusher da poter acquistar".
Io lo guardo un bel p? gli faccio capire che: "boh!" 
Lui fa finta di nulla con la mossa di uno che sta malato di hip-hop, 
intrippato di rap, calato di trip,
la faccia di chi ? appena uscito da un bar in cerca di un cespuglio con la spugna. 
Poi si mette a gridar come un pazzo a pazzo agitando le mani sporche di spray, 
si ? sparato un wholecar con lo sfondo di blu, l'outline che lo segue come un'ombra! 
Poi si piazza un throw up e cos? come ? arrivato il tipo se ne va 
Strofa 3 (Paura): 
Vengo da Napoli provincia. 
Ordine del pariamiento con Callister e Cast?, la storia comincia quando 
tu non sapevi neppure cos'era il flow 
oppure facevi ridere e dicevi che stavi ancora imparando. 
La verit? ? che tipi come noi qui non ce n'? 
e non ce n'? mai stato. 
In pista il team pi? potenziato. Tu al massimo puoi fare l'apprendista. 
Sar? un disgraziato a dirtelo, 
ma ho la lista di ogni volta che ti ho distanziato. 
Strofa 4 (Domasan):
Pupazzi/ cuori ingrati/ disintegrati come palazzi
Rumore di vetri in mille pezzi
Tigri in gabbia/ sangue a spruzzi
Mangiatoti di sabbia/ citano la bibbia/ verit? a sprazzi
Stretti ai muri come arazzi/ pensieri folli gi? come foglie
Giudica meglio certi scherzi
Per mancanza di spazi si tramutano in screzi
? un puzzle per pazzi.

Melchiorre in citt?

Solita notte straleso, peniello acceso per strada preso bene, penso: "sto posto ? ostile", per? sto a posto ho stile, tecnica, flow, rime, do merda che ? concime
conci i ciocci con le medicine. 
Rimedi decine di aspetti, decidi i codici, sleghiamoci dai nodi che ci danno! 
Raggi di sole oscuri a prezzi modici, affanno, e tra i palazzi 
fanno di noi mazzi, singoli come cazzi, simboli mai sazi, dispari gli spazi 
colpi bassi ripari agli spari coi sassi. 
Si assiste agli stessi sorpassi. 
Spiragli di merda a spirale i cazzotti che incassi dai pazzi. 
In azione: 
tririce bastard, dj gruff, dj 2phast, dj tay one, ? uno svarione!
Strofa 8 (Joz):
Basta l'appartenenza, up and down per la scena 
questa ? la band testane la presenza e
i diversi versi per silenzi immersi di segni,
sogni divisi da sorsi, verit? nascoste nei silenzi.
La professione di premere il tasto enter sul processore,
professore mi processi una volta e per tutte di dire cazzate, 
lasciando tag nei cessi delle autostrade,
prede allo stato brado,
pietre di fumo su un prato di weeda su carta da parato.
Non mi sono mai parato,
n? nato imparato, mai comprato a rate nella Nato,
passato giornate su giornali,
la notizia non gira in gita in un articolo di un apparente agitato
che vende in edicola coca e cervelli in scatola, 
da un naso che cola che vola a fine rigo 
appena finito una striscia punto a capo
suona sempre bene se si combina in una cabina
con un microfono puntato..

Senza Offesa 
Strofa 1 (Joz):
Senza offesa dell'essenza forse me ne frega,
prega sfrega ma riguardati, stregami ma sappi che non sono in rotta,
anche se la rota torna puntuale,
scappando su tacchi a nasconder fianchi pacchi a chi come fausto fusto,
con giochi sleali nosi macchi ingegni marchi ciocci e vuoi proporti.
Parto per nuovi porti non traffico su marmi in macchine rombanti con pippotti,
amo solo mamm?!
Romantico amore per un mestiere antico come il mondo
zappo con una zeppa in un locale pieno zeppo, 
un fiacco a fianco zuppo, sono tre ore che ti darei fuoco con una zippo.
Ma non mi attizza chi cala come Jerry, 
sono finiti i mon cherry ed hai preso dei rosch al posto dei ferrero roch?, 
andresti nel tre con una stecca di perry,
o con un testo che tocca un tasto scontato, 
un pretesto scemo per abbordare una signorina che si inceppa nell'esprimere concetti,
una mente come cioccolato fondente, pensieri su di un infante
che non ha l'et? come Gigliola Cinguetti, 
e se apre bocca e da chiudergliela con la sgagliola.
Sai che c'? ? un knock out sulla psiche, 
ho un tot di amiche che sanno che non ? la stessa cosa in fondo.
Ho detto scio' ad un orda balorda che balla strisciando addosso una vrenzola 
detta la mecca del mondo,
capitata per caso sotto le mie lenzuola a casa. 
Adesso bevo di meno,
ne cerco una con la testa meno intasata di nome non fa sofisticata in giornata!

Do amore, prendo amore
e tu non punti al sentimento,non sei nata per me
Se sei troppo orgogliosa e dici sempre "io ti chiamer?",
ma ogni giorno sono io a fare il tuo numero.
La vita tua ? fatta a segreti e poi tutte bugie 
e non ? vero che le colpe sono tutte mie.
Tieni sempre qualcosa che ti manca,

esteso alle bucchine, bucchine, punto ai buchi delle bucchine, 
sono super potenziato oltre il confine, 
quando la merda e rovente, 
vengo come Sirio con il colpo segreto del drago nascente, 
danza come Jim sulla strada del serpente il tuo culo sul mio cazzo incandescente.

Bred In The Bone 
Didn't you want to place
Didn't you want to show
No you've got a disease
And it's laid you low
(Laid you low)
If you had it in you
What you had before
You could pick yourself up
Up off of the floor
(Laid you low)
What's come over you
What could it be
Does it have a name
An identity
(Laid you low)
Do you need a doctor
The head of surgery
Do you want a dealer
Who'd give you shit for free

Dirty Little Rat 
(John Critchley)
Dirty little rat, never could get it straight
The man upstairs says he doesn't care
If you live 'til daylight
Dirty little rat
Get your coat, get your hat
We're gonna take a ride tonight
My sweet baby boy, born under circumstance
I'm gonna give you all I got to give you a chance
Sweet baby boy
You're going to understand
Someday you'll be a man
Something inside snapped
I stil ldon't understand
The deal went down, I looked around
I was left holding the bag
Something inside cracked
The deal went down, I looked around
And now here I am

Going Under 
I hear the door slam shut, so I know that you're home
You've been out all night, I've been here alone
And I've been wondering if you're the same person I knew
The bright lights that shine in your eyes, they make me blind
I hear a footstep on the stairs so I know that you're near
You've returned from pursuing your nocturnal career
And I don't ask where you've been, with who, or if they're your friend
'Cause I don't really want to know right now, I don't know when I will again
CHORUS
Going under, drifting down, going under
And I know you've still got a ways to go down before
We can rise back up into the light
We're going under, drifting down...
I hear you coughing in the hall so I know you're all right
It will be morning soon, through the gloom I see daylight
But in this room right now I am alone, I am unsure
I don't know what you feel anymore and it scares me so

Lift You Up

Your mind is all cluttered now
But you drag yourself along somehow
Through dark dreams of that visit you in the night
Obscure fragments with broad daylight
Watch me now
What did you say about what I've done
What do you want to know, why or how come?
Haven't you learned yet that it never ends
Back and forth and around, here it comes again
CHORUS
Watch me now
And I'll lift you up if I can
Watch me now
You're eyes are wild and your nerves exposed
But you haven't lost anything, not by a mile, not yet
Can yo uremember the good times
They can be back soon, better than before

Moment Of Clarity 
(John Critchley)
I remember, one November we had our picnic
At the graveyard down your street
On the bodies under our feet
And the cold grey ancient autumn ships
Looked down without a frown
It laughed down without a sound
While the sun hit her face in disgrace
She doesn't see the competition from the human race
Competition from the human race
And now you're wondering, where's it going to end
And now you're wondering, could we begin again
While the laser of immortality, it burns through
All our memories, it cuts through what we want to see
As we spin on our axes
A moment of clarity is all that's required of me
And all other places and other times, they're
Waving goodbye, goodbye
So send me your autumn pledge and please me
Till winter time and I'll send you a 
Springtime boy

More 
I can feel something inside
And it wants to get out
Growing every day in a different way
I can't put it in words
It could be now or maybe later
It can read my mind
I've pretended not to notice
What's been happening inside
But as the days go drifting buy
I can deny it no more
Ihear a voice, getting louder
It calls my name
And it wants more
Well, once you've learned, once and for all
This is nothing new
The rest is easy, I'm sure that you'll see
It belongs to you
It may be silent or may be too loud
But it's hear to stay
And it wants more

Perpetual motion machine, it came to me in a dream
Let's catch some air, that's if you dare
I'm only sixteen but you're my queen
It's a bright, bright morning, the road stretches far
The corn on the right, the wheat on the left
There's a hill up ahead, let's catch some air
Perpetual motion machine, I picked up a magazine
Poor aimless, poor aimless, poor aimless me
Aimlessly
Now look at the fireball extinguish the sun
My daddy would perish if only he knew
Hundred and forty, air feeds the fire

Saviour 
(John Critchley)
You've got two eyes and pocket
Strange eyes of the visionary
No one knows where your name is
You only live in memory
When you walk down the street
They throw rose petals at your feet
I didn't know you were for real
Until I saw you today on TV
Live at 3
On CBC
They said, 
The saviour has returned today.
They said that you were from heaven
They said that you rule
Well it must all be true
because you look so cool
They said you returned
To wash away the sins of the world
Well, holy fucking shit
Sweet Jesus, won't you touch me please
Set me free
Save me
The saviour has returned today
They said you were from heaven
They said that you ruled
Well it must be true
'Cause you look so cool
Your eyes are like pools
Come on sweet fool
The saviour has returned today

Smoke And Ashes 
Tick-tock went the watch on your wrist
Telling you softly of the minutes you've missed
Kneeling down with your head in the bowl
Telling yourself, there should never be days like this
Just when you thought that you had it down
You woke up dreaming of cocaine and clowns
Everybody knew that you sang the blues
No one could guess that you would sing them like this
CHORUS
Smoke and ashes
Smoke and ashes
A comet burns and then it crashes
Smoke and ashes
You spilled the beans on Friday night
Now Monday's here and there's no one in sight
But, hey, that's the price that you've got to pay
For letting yourself get your own way

(John Critchley)
Time is so hard to find when your occupied
Lost in my own world, I didn't notice what's happening
Last time that I saw you I said things
That I didn't mean and now I wish I could take them back
But that was long ago and now it's today
And it's much too late
Though God knows I would change the past if I could
Weather is changing again, animals are moving in new directions
When you coming home, it's been too long
Don't be such a stranger, I'd love to see you soon
Do you remember me, well I remember you
Won't you come to me
I want to see you so bad
I want to be with you right now

The Golden Age 
So the Golden Age passed away to silver
But that was long ago
There were swimming holes and the Vaudeville
They gave way to this
Bronze turned itself slowly into iron
And here we are today
If what you say has a grain of truth
The age of rust is soon
Please, it's not a thing just to bring you down
It's just a passing phase
But who'll believe your piano played itself
A long forgotten air
CHORUS
The Golden Age, it'll never fade away
Today just don't seem the same
The Golden Age, it'll never fade away
If you were there
There will always be someone telling you
That these are wicked times
Rainy days come down just to make you think
Of all the shades of grey
No one knew that you liked to paint
Until they cleaned your room

Not enough of this, too much that
So many voices tried to speak as one
Whatcha doing right, whatcha doing wrong

You took it hard, you shook it down
But maybe this time, like no ther time
You'll be unbound
When your feet of clay finally hit the ground
At the speed of sound, nothing more was heard
In a flash of fire that left behind no smoke
What was once too bright is now as dark as night
CHORUS
I wish that I could say that I was surprised
When I heard the news tthat you had said goodbye
I hope you're doing well, I hope it's good this time

Sometimes I'm dirty, sometimes I'm clean
Sometime I talk in circles so I don't know what I mean
Although I am uncertain, one thing seems clear
I don't know very much, but I'm still glad to be here
Because I've got a conscience and he's got the same name
When it goes badly he gets the blame
When it goes good I get the acclaim
When I get hit he feels the pain
Weren't you before me or were in the past
You'll have to excuse me, I didn't think that this was going to last
Well, I heard the road that spirals down
Has been paved with the best intentions that can be found
I've got a conscience and he's got a name
When it goes badly he gets the blame
When it goes good I get the acclaim
When I get hit he feels the pain

What If We Don't Get What We Want

We were sitting at the head of a car
And her lips were dry and parched
And we turned to each other
We were listening to 
Suspicious Minds
CHORUS
And we're cracking codes and combinations
And we're thinking
What if we don't get what we want
SWell, you kick away your golden shoes
Counting what you can afford to lose
And I can't treat you casually
We are not fond of misery

On the frozen lake of memory
You were asking me about my dream
And we're turning to each other
And we are so primitive

Dropping, and it weighs a ton
Everything you can convey
It's like you're crawling to me
It's soft and you'd call if fake
Everything that you burn
Everything that you can convey
Your words are made up fact
Everything's crumbling down
Talking shit, you confess all this shit
You'd better die and convert
Because you know your part
Don't play dead sentiments
Don't lie, show something that you

Too bad we could not be like normal friends
Too bad it had to end this way
Be certain I will never forget you

Room with a gun in his mouth
And he smiles suddenly, 
The memories come crashing in
Despite the fact that he's better
Off without her still images cloud
His mind to confusion just to bid farewell.
This space is for you
It can't be yours till it's mine
Just another record
Makes up for what you did
This old face that you
See it makes me sick inside
So pray that this would be another choice to decide
A part of inner collection
A taste of my affection
I try to get this for you
A patience for no one
(I'm waiting, what's taking you so long? )
And if you would just take me now
(Take me now)
I guess it's up to you
(Always has and always will)
A taste of myself
Another way to recite
And it feels so good
Just to know that I'm inside
I destroy myself
So take heed remember
How you were freed
I want to go to this place
Yet I don't know which way it is

Bad Day 
"Bad Day"
Verse
Let me tell you 'bout my day
The things that nearly drove me insane
I'm wilted, withered, bruised, and to blame
But tonight I'm gonna put them to shame
Chorus 1
Sittin driver's seat, slammin' whiskey 'till its time
To stumble through the door, bastard knew that she was mine
Away, I stray
Now I'm flyin' down the street, with busted up glass
Didn't leave a witness, gotta get away fast
Away... Bad day
Verse
I'm tryin' to wipe the blood out of my eyes
Sometimes I don't know why I even try
I will say this they fought one hell of a fight
I guess it's just too bad they had to die
Chorus 2
Sittin' driver's seat, laughing at their flashing lights
I could run forever, but the tanks gettin' dry
Away, I stray
Stalled side of the street, with the busted up glass
Cops are movin' in, they wanna but my ass
Away... Bad day
Chant (2X)
Get back, I won't settle down
The only way to heaven is a long road from hell
Get back, I won't put it down
The only way to heaven is a long road from hell

Trouble here I've found
Goes beyond boots and blood

Until that day she strolled right out of my life
Oh lord, now I'll never be free

I met up with you in a distant coffee shop
Your eyes and your smile made my heart stop
A few months together, then it began to rain
Poured like my whisky down the drain

Now baby, you're gone
Bowline in my belly, thoughts of you make me sick
Now baby, I'm gone

The change I see in you is makin' my head spin
Now my only comforts in a bottle of gin
You came home so late and tried to start a fight
Lay back, I can go all night

Tired of your emptiness and comfort with the pain
My sanity drove you insane

Yours is just my size

Broad played to many games with my head

Left a few of my things out in broad daylight
An empty bottle some messy clothes
Then he hit my head

Shufflin' through all this shit
I found some lyrics and this is what they read
Who am I?
Who am I?

Guns baby Guns
On the center of destruction
But for me it's my mind and my mind I can't let go

High as I once fell

I hunger for the darkness, my only will in life.
Wind blows leaves on the ground,
Autumn surrounds me with it's beauty.
I gather myself where I'm not found,
to gaze into the midnight sky.
I try for once to forget everything in my life.
To be at ease with with my tortured mind.
To hide my sorrow that grows inside.
To be by myself, DEAD TO THE WORLD!
I've hated myself for a long,
I need to let the pain out.
Make my mind subside in the light of the Full Moon.
Burning leaves fill the cold air, wrap myself into me.
I want the night to set my heart free.
Will this night comfort me?
Tears fall down my face,
for something can't be placed.

You decided to leave the misery behind,
take a chance in the dark beyond.
You've just pick up the pieces and dissapear,
the torture forever ate your soul.
You just want it all to fade away,
as you step into a world unknown.
Winds whisper within the dead trees,
leaves flow a upon the ground.
You wrap your arms to keep warm,
within you wonder is this Depression?
LIFE JUST DIDN'T GIVE YOU A BREAK,
YOU GOT DAMNED WITH TORTURE AND PAIN.
If SOMEONE SHOULD JOIN YOU ARE THEY LEAVING,
LEAVING THE SAME MISERY BEHIND?
The emptiness you feel will subside,

Both of you decided to leave the misery behind,

Cold, Dark And Empty 
I've tried to love.
But it ends up breaking.
I've given my heart.
It's gotten stomped upon.
Crucify my emotions
Doing it in front of everyone.
Tears may shed,
But inside I'm forever dead.
Cold, Dark, Empty
You wonder why I am the way I am.
Maybe you are the one to make me this way.
You've tried to seep into me.
Wondering if there's still love inside?
The day is done.
And darkness Falls
As I walk into the night.
I know that I lost you
I know that it is over.
I know it's true,
we're through.
Thinking I'm depressed.
I once was but no more!
No one to give me the attention I needed.
I gained a giant hole.
Sadness for months painted on my face.

Sharing nothing with no one.

A sent of incense in the air,

I walk the beaten paths,

I wonder if they are there,
right beside me as I walk this night?
Wind blows a creepy tune,
Sending chills up my spine.
In the blackest of clothes,
as if I'm in mourning. 
If you look within you'll see a beating heart.
If you ask why I'm always blackend,
I'll say this is me, who I am.
I dwell within the dark to hide from you all.
I cry deep inside for those who are now gone.
I keep those people in my memory.

A bloody holocaust of flesh protects

Antichrist Warzone 
To break the barriers of every man's hope
Just show him: reality
Just give him a glimpse of what's beyond,
The lies of sanity
Just show him the lies spun around
Their so-called "normality"
I'll offer you nothing but the simple truth
Just based upon what your eyes can see
There is no heaven, there is no hell
The only truth as you can see it for yourself
So trust nobody but yourself
For that's the only thing you can know that exists
And die with dignity
Thoughts and memories come toward you
Reminds you of your loss and curse
Loss of past, curse of future
You decide what your life should be like
Stop wasting your time and energy
On those unworthy of your affection
The only thing certain is the presence of your being
And like this it will be till the day you die
A significant life through other eyes who see
As meaningless as there can be for me
Hope replaced by hatred
I've never been closer to the "truth"
I'm truly expressing "gratitude"
True thoughts of an atheist
I'll swear to the one that even darkness fear
With a sharp conscience
Risen through lost faith
I'm every drop of hate!
Asking myself why they fear death
When all I fear is endless pain
Can't find a reason in this mess called life
There's no solution as easy as the one I give you
Just a shot gun with a single blast
Or face reality
And face your own fears
And grow stranger
And die with dignity
This is how I remind you of my presence

Rejection
Self destruction

Beyond The Apocalypse 
An infernal madness sweeps me along
On a mind blowing trip to the utter beyond
Here I render chaos, not as force 
But as state
A state of a consuming and
Conceiving mass
Pouring time into the endless hole 
Of eternity
Letting forever be endless and the
End be forever
A fulfillinh vision of the ultimate
Death machine
Harvesting beings through it's emptiness
And void
Like scattered ghosts from lost dreams 
Filling a blurred fog of nightmares
Entering a state of the final 
Consummation
And swallowing the poison from
The kiss of death
Utter apocalyptic grandeum
Revealing it's majestic power
Manifesting it's true will 
Through demonic slaves
One ruling force which is all
Nonegiving, all corrupting 
Both destructive and creative
A total mayhem of emptiness
To live as an Immortal
You must endure and explode life
And know what secret treasures await
Here..beyond the apocalypse.

Through a maggot coated world
Through a tunnel of knives
Like an angel in a devil's den
Crawling out of the slime

Bound upon the wheel of hell
See your neck upon the blades

Into impurity and hate
Massacre a dark paradise
Blood is the mortar
Forged upon bones of death
Infernal eternal infamy
Blood is the mortar
Lay waste this world in blasphemy
Through hasty pillars of green light
Through clouds of carrion flies
Let the world see me drag you to hell
And your soul wrenched from your body
It fills my heart with fury
Like a storm of brooding doom
To relish in the bloodspill
Worship your own butchers
Rising piles of the dead

Soulbound human heid
Deathmass in necrotic delights
Inhuman ritual tormentors
Rising in full majesty
Thirst for retribution

Missing the blood of human throats
So many years, ages ago

Wanderings out of space
Wandering out of time
A world out of light, death at the end
Only silence can be heard, silence of peoples tears
No one knows my grave

[Music: Archaon, Lyrics: Archaon]
In the end, a new era beckons
Settling the foundation of an infernal dimension of wrath
A revelation strikes with new awareness upon the masses
Veil of darkness unravel, a horrific sphere unfolds
An altering of the senses - to discover
What is behing light, beyond celestial slavery
Entangles the mind in dark waves, fiery 
&
 monotonous
Deep is the well of dark mystery
The enlightenment of madness presents itself
On the soil above a lower world
In everlasting ebony shades of the damned
Choirs of madness chant in agonny, as blood
Flows furiously (through my veins)
Blurred visions - through a smoke-filled sky
With fists clenched, I gaze on through the ugly
The only right path
The surge of deconstruction casts light aside
The summoning at last
Deceiver - pioneer of this insight
Consume what is of joy
Consume what is of joy!
And enless rage until we dance on the hypocrites' grave
Step on the crucifix
Ans speak the tongue of blasphemy
The shivery
Crawling, freezing through the innards 
&
 up the spine
The separating of this shell of flesh
&
 a dark spirituality
Do I believe?
It believes in me

Chaos Within 
Your throats are empty and your words are shallow
You are too weak to understand that the time for revenge has come
I'll see your suffering, it is infernal
I will show you your faults
I will pound you till you fall
Your weakness enslaves you, binds you to your primitive thoughts
Kneel, as a slave before a master, for you the pain has just begun
You disgust me with your base existence
You're just apathetic excuse, not what they call: a man
You're just a soul in a human shell, not a soul with a true existence
I'll liberate you from this cage of flesh
Now is the time to fucking die
Die like a pig, die like a coward
Die like a mindless shell
Die like the rest!
I close my eyes, focus my aggression
Focus my will, reaching out with tendrils of hate
My mind's eye, burns your soul
Sears your flesh, caress you with deadly rage
I open my eyes, your corpse still burns
No match for my fiery hate!
Aggression abating as you wither:

Chasing Dragons 
I am chasing dragons
Seeking the primal state of mind
Filling my veins with venomous lust
Awakening the beast inside
Seeking no meaning only feeling
Entering the shape of the beholder
And get ready to fight
An overwhelming attack of emotionless fury
Seek to trigger the fright inside
Conquer your fears and kill your courage
A mind seeking mission is on stake
Exploration of strength 
In mind, body and heart
An ultimate test of the 
Presence of your being
Not to think 
Only act on instincts while you steer
Into the face of your possible death
Sharpens you to the utter limits 
Of consenus
So close but yet so far in presence
Of this observation
Viewing this fight through primal eyes
Felling neither good nor bad
A state of carelessness is what I am feeling
The pleasure of ultimate pain
Is sending warning light flashes
Of inational behavior not humanly
Accepted
But humanity is no longer an issue
Inational feelings are non-existing
The only reality is the ongoing fight
Coldness and grimness swarms to my blood
Regaining strength to fight on
When all the pain is gone and the wounds are healed
The awakening of a new chase is on for the strong
From beyond I have traveled
And to the end I will see
Enter the dragon
Causing it's will to be mine
Pay the price of immortality and 
Achieve victory to the mind
But the battle rages on..

End Of All 
I have haunted your soul
I have fought your battles
I gave you the answers
I took your pain away
Now is the time to harvest
Now is the time to collect
To see what you have conquered
And to send your soul: to hell!
Burning corpses, the stench of flesh
Scorched field, the cleansing of the earth
Where are your gods?
Your dying prayers as futile as your faith
Every man to himself
Figure out the ways of belief
The existence of denial
I could never be crowned in that pitiful way
Cursed souls, drenched in loss
Defeated by the ineffable force
To live in oblivion or die with pride
Burning lights flashes memories
Can't hold back, can't hold still
As I scream out the message:
No hope, no fear - this is the end of all!
Hear the screams of lost souls
Hear them begging for mercy
They lost the battle
They experienced the pain
Now is the time to harvest
Now is the time to collect
To see what you have conquered
And to send your soul: to hell!
Flayed bodies eyeless skulls
Inhumanity, the awaited fall
Feel the godless wrath
That heralds the end of all
Burning lights flashes memories
Can't hold back, can't hold still
As I scream out the message:
No hope, no fear - this is the end of all!

Evil Oath 
Riding the wings of the unholy wind
To be carried to an eclipsed place of chaos
To be taken far away from holy ground.
Away from the falling christ and his father
As nights and days passes, till we turned to dust
Series of simple gestures make me perish,
As I said farewell to light an god of desillusions
To follow thee into darkness wich i long for
The source of fire, always burning in my heart
I hereby give you ME,
To declare WAR!
I bare no regrets for these actions,
I fulfill them with pride, I worship all that is ours.
Joining the mach of the even fall.
To be at your disposal, the blade when
You release damnation
I fulfill these actions with pride, I worship
All that is ours.
Open the gates, greet me welcome
Independence carried me away from lies and hipocricy
The god of sickness and his sickening angels
To reach a new aeon, wich I seek...
As nights and days passes untill I've turned to dust
My soul is thine to cleanse, to form
To shape like thy signs of yours

From The Deeps 
[Music: Archaon, Lyrics: Seidemann]
Ia! Ia!
The stars are rights!
For aenos they have slumbered
Dead but dreaming
Waiting beneath the waves
Awaken!
Daemon-gods of primeval times
Coming round full circle
Stirring in the deep
Rise! Rise! Rise!
Boiling wasters part
Cyclopean cities emerge
From the deeps
And then...
Insanity and fear
Overwhelm the humans
Outnumbered and inferior
Kraken, Leviathan, Cthulhu
So many names given
To the fear from the deeps...
Awaken! Kraken
Awaken! Leviathan
Awaken! Cthulhu
Rise! Rise! Rise! Rise!
From the deeps...

My icon is the pentagram
The warmth from me
Are pleasures of the flesh
I fill you with ecstasy
My nature is that of excess
Let me out of the circle
And I will burn you
I will burn you!
My icon is the cross of Peter
I turn the aeons
I destroy dead dogmas
And create the paradigms
Of the new order
Of the new order!
Of the new order!
I sparkle with vitality and force
Why,
Fools of fear
Do you want me to burn inside the dead?

I Am Abomination 
[Music: Tjalve, Lyrics: Destroyer (Nocturnal Breed)]
Hellfire!
I have always been here
In all forms in all perversions
I will always be here
In all ways in all times
A question in hidding
A solution in disguise
I know no bounds
Like a locust storm I rise
Leprous hell-world
My world
Night world
Blood coated
World despoiler
The master of a devils march
I have crossed infernal wastedlands
To plant my flag amongst yer' bones
Rising like a broken bone
Throught a sea of flesh
This world is given
Blood coated
World despoiler
The master of a devils march
Rising like a broken bone
Throught a sea of flesh
This world is given
I have got paths yet to trade
I am abomination
Blood coated
World despoiler
The master of a devils march
Rising like a broken bone
Throught a sea of flesh
This world is given
There is a rot whitin us
The flames lick through your veins
The abhorrent mark descending
Abomination crawling near
The absolute inhuman
I bear the abhorrent mark
My touch like hell's fire
I am abomination
I am abomination!

I Breathe Spears 
Falling into a nocturnal vacuum, I call for Satan, the
Keyholder
For his world I shall enter
My call is answered
By force am I taken to realms, darker than death,
To witness the evil glory I have travelled to see
Many are the appearing shapes of Satan
Unfolding in utter grotesque horror
The air is frozen
I can hear the hateful rumbling and pounding in the
Deep
I can see flickering spectres, silouettes blistering with-
Electric coldness
I breathe spears
Unleashing a pulsating storm of steel
Sulphur floats in my veins
My eyes burn with fury
Carbonised into my heart
Far away, a wast bastard cross manifests in
The air
How dare it shine so clear
Here in theese hellish realms?
Oh, did I not know of the impurity...
As the blasphemy becomes unbearable
I behold thousands of claws gripping the
Golden cross from behind
Soon demons crawl like furious ants all over
The profante shape
Screaming in unearthly rage and insanity
The symbol of Nazarene us thirb asunder
Dripping with slime and rot
I shiver in cruel ecstacy
And laugh the madmans laughter
Returning now
With diabolical strength
And a vicious grin in the face

Internal Winter 
Ad Infermum
I was alone
The path lay before me
Illuminated by 
The blood of those 
Who went 
The hard way
Silence appressive
Death imminent
Chaotic evil
Raping the order
Killing the light
Submit to your fears
Obsessed with your faults
Surrender to the darkness within
Initializing Armageddon
End of transmission
Massa di requiem per tellus
Amanged for choir 
&
 flesh
An eldritch chaos of demon cacophony
Such sweet disharmony
Almost sacred
In it's blasphemy
Now..
To rest
To die
Sleep..
Perchance to dream
Of nightmares and coffin-worm
Such sprrow, then
To wake up 
To be alive
Not dreaming
In a corpsecity beneath the waves..
Infernal Winter
No way to recapture the feeling
Cannot reclaim a crumbled throne
Cursed with awareness
Of a time that has died
Detached I sever the bonds
Adoming my shell with crimson threads
Attuning my flesh to my spirit 
Revelling in the agony
My breath is chill
My blood is ice
My embrace the freezing death
Frozen to the core
Subzero emotions
So cold it burns
Let the cold penetrate you
Let the cold penetrate you
Let the cold..all the way..in.

Legion 
Like a ghost I wander
Withdrawn from reality
Becoming a misantrophe
Summonizing spirits to me
Fighting humanity
No need to watch my back
For they are fighting with me
[Chorus]
We match into war slaughtering mankind
If you try to stop us we will give you hell
(from wich we came)
Join us if you dare
Join us if you can
Choose sides,
Or escape to survive
Blood red is the sky
Blood red is the earth
Blood red are the rivers and mountains
That we pass
Black smoke fills the air
From the corpse pyres around
Burning mankind
And have it buried underground
[Chorus]
Their funeral pyres, lighting the earth
Smoke blots out the sun, creating eternal night
Gone is humanity, trampled to the ground
Suffocated by the ashes, utopia of thy design
Lend us your sword
And ours will be yours
Give us your strength
And recieve it thousandtold
The demon army
Marching over forth
Fullfilling the vision:
An untained world
Don't oppose us...resistance is futile
We annhilate all enemy forces
Nobody can stop us now
Defeat of mankind, a victory of misanthropy

Liberation 
As time floats by I'm stuck
On this point of no return
The world, a stage upon wich
A neular play unfolds
Flickering by in shades of grey
Permeated by absurdity
Like a glossy polished reality
Slowly fading into oblivion
Unconcious but aware
Awake, yet dreaming
Alive, still limbonic
Awaiting the libreration
The fallen angel of Doom appears
I behold his fury in fear
Disguised he enters the play
Fullfilling the obscurity
I see the stage crumble
I see the curtains fall
The final act begins
As death reveals it's disguise
Escaping mankind, escaping doom
Outrun (the) fear, outrun Death
Heading for the promised land
To gain immortality
Let the play of liberation begin anew
The circle is ended
A new play begins
No need to witness
Know the end
Let all fears go by
Drift into oblivion

Manifest 
For I have seen beyond the stars
I have felt the strength of chaos
I have reached the point of sanity
And was married by the Chaos star
I welcomed the darkness that filled my soul
I was blessed by the madnessof the Chaos star
This is my destiny
The choices I have made
No hope, no fear
This is Manifest
If you could see through my eyes
You would see the things (of wich) I speak
The point of sanity
And the mark of the Chaos star
I can show you the darkness that fills my soul
I can brand your empty soul with the mark of the Chaos star
This is my destiny
The choices I have made
No hope, no fear
This is Manifest
Do you dare to open your eyes?
And see what is out there?
Do you dare to close them again?
And see it reflected in your mind?
Do you know what to look for?
Or do you see what you want to see?
Is your mind open and free?
Or polluted by Christianity?
Do you speak your own mind?
Or the mind of the masses?
Do you practise what you preach?
Or are you full of shit!
Do you walk your own path?
Or do you follow a leader?

Nathicana 
[Music: Archaon, Lyrics: Seidemann]
Goodbye o creature of folly
The sun still sheds light
On your towers
Of steel and glass
And they will bear silent witness
To the futility of your achivements
And the beasts will roam your streets
Feasting on your cooling flesh
Never again will your like be seen
Such arrogance and folly
The worm has conquered
And you return to dust
Millennia of evolution
Science and religion
Toil and suffering
Still you never learn
Now it is over
And how futile it all was
The dreams on mankind
Rotting away
And thus we all fade
Weep not for your destiny
No-one will be left to mourn

Flesh fresh from the womb
Still warm, still kicking, still life..

Hungering for perfection

Perished In Pain 
I once had a vision
A visionof hell 
A clear blue flame
Burning throughout the universe
A massive force of ultimate evil
A destructive and tormenting flame
Wiping out all reason and sanity
An altering flame
A flame of corruption
So purifying and unholy
A withering maelstrom 
Of endless havoc
Reaping it's way
Throughtout the endless chaos of life
If this is hell
Then hell is not the end
I long to behold the infinity
And to harvest it's secrets
(so) I spit in the eye of fear
And set sail on a sea of fire
Black winds of doom
Bring me to my destined desire
There is nothing
Nothing for a human mind
Only oblivion
And mankind..Destined to Perish..in Pain
An infernal contamination
Of sickness and pestilence
Of this flame chaos is bred
And through this flame it is spread
Chaos lies in it's wake.

Where nothing is as you know it today
A desert of death and destruction
Pray that only the suns make day
To reach this land you must travel far
Into space, beyond time
Leave civilisation behind and prepare for
Survival of the fittest / a world of 3 suns
Behold the desert through nocturnal eyes
The endless day / the night pitch black
Eclipsing the suns from the world
Leaving darkness and fear behind

Cling to the light and trust the strong to survive

Remove Jehova

Walk through the valley of death
Smell the stench of decay
As the war is ending
They will curse this day
On this day Death walks the earth
Reaping all mandkind
As the sky burns we march forward

Hunt down all survivors, living in fear
We ride with death so no one is spared
What once were will never be again

Do you hear them calling from beyong?
As a foulness ye shall know them
As a foulness thou knowest thyself
Freed from the shackles of morality
And long long gone is the need for science
Through the wakening of the beast within
Oh did you not rejoice?
When you felt the power... the power in your mind
No longer confined to nocturnal solitude
Walk among the herd
Mold them as you wish
In images of unearthly bizarrerie
Do you hear them calling from beyong?
Sculptor of flesh
Architect of abomination
Mold the living flesh like clay
Sculptor of flesh
Warp the world
To your linking
And then the sun will set
And no new day will rise on humanity
Will you grieve for them?
Will the lack of their bleating cacophony
Strike a note within?
Rejoice, destroyer, anti-christ
For your deed was long overdue

Singer Of Strange Songs 
I told you about the world
Of how the stuggle for order and peace
And self-important hypocrisy fails
In the face of reality
And how there is no grand scheme
No rest for the living..only death
Chaos and the cold endless void
Is all that awaits..
We are all forgotten
We are all dust
We are all unimportant
We are all dead
No rest for the living..only death
You thought me mad
You wanted me to be like you, 
To see the error of my ways..
So you told me things I knew were wrong
You showed me why I would never fit in
Why then, does what I have become surprise you?
Dreamer,
Prophet,
Singer of strange songs
I went my own twisted way
Mocked by the world
Feared by the righteous
But always where I wanted..
Now that all has changed,
And the night is colder
Now that life has shown it's true colors
And you..
You are forgotten
You are old
You are unimportant
You are dead
Can you face the real truth?
Can you call me a madman anymore?
Do you regret your selfless life?
The things you could never do,
In fear of what others would think?
Do you see why I became a:
Dreamer,

You all shall be none
Crawl back to your nest
Salt this earth with your dying sons
Feverish dreams of a world down in flames
Marching to the downstrokes
Of hells titan pistons
Exquisite execution
In a burning grip
The rotted life - blood drains away
Onto rottendom
Standind in mute judgement
Foul souls in bounds of iron
Harkening to the death watch
Hell is your cross to bear
Hell is your cross to bear!

And you're body and mind are one. 
(You're moving, keep climbimg.) 
Your heart like cool ashes, 
(You're moving, keep climbimg.) 
The life sprays through your nippled eyes 
Like ribbon through your lashes. 
It ripples down with your heart's clear 
you're mixed in two, 
The poisoned ear. 
The love you feel is love you hear. 
You leave! 
Leave! Leave! 
Leave your body behind! 
Leave! Leave! Leave! 
Leave your body behind! 
Remember, Remember, Remember, Remember

Roller Coaster 
Once, somewhere, sometime ago
His eyes were clear to see, 
He put his thoughts into my mind, 
And gave my self to be
He stopped me from living so unsane, 
I could be just what I want to be, 
Things appear as they really are, 
I can see just what I wanted to see
Come on, and let it happen to you
I say, I say come on, and let it happen to you
You gotta open up your mind
And let everything come through... 
Come on yeah! 
Well it starts like a roller coaster ride, 
So real it takes your breath away
It slides you through your point of view, 
You look back to where you thought you'd stayed
Your ride changes outside view, 
While it glides you like a neon ray, 
And you find you don't have to search for words, 
For there's nothing to be said
Come on, you gotta let it happen to you
Hey, come on, and let it happen to you
You gotta open up your mind
And let everything come through... 
After you trip life opens up, 
You start doing what you want to do
And you find out that the world that you once feared, 
Gets what it has from you
No one can ever hurt you
But you know more than you thought you knew
And you're looking at the world
With brand new eyes, 
And no one can ever spoil the view
Come on, and let it happen to you
Hey, hey, hey come on, and let it happen to you
You gotta open up your mind
And let everything come through... 
Open up your mind, 
Let everything come through...

Rose And The Thorn 
A brand new smile on a brand new angel's face.
It won't change, it won't change.
You're here to stay until your last living breath is complete.
It' won't change, it won't change.
Here she comes, my love,
with the earth beneath her feet,
my love she comes.
She cares.
I do not ask her why she cares,
she cares.
And this is not untold, 
within her eyes,
spoken by her soul.
The dawn of truth will rise!
Liberty will find us,
Grown cold, and make him stoned.
The canon stops it's firing,
the unknown soldier will come home.
Faith cannot remain,
wicked words have been confirmed false.
A single drop of the rain,
the rose and and thorn...
The Rise and the Fall!

She Lives In A Time Of Her Own 
She lives, no fear
Doubtless in everything she knows
Through time unchecked,
The sureness of her flows.
She leaves herself inside you when she goes.
She lives in a time of her own...
You have always heard her speaking,
She's always been in your ear.
Her voice sounds a tone within you,
Listen to the words you hear.
Her time has no past or future,
She lives everything she sees.
Her time doesn't spin outside here,
It's in every breath she breaths.
She lives in a time of her own...
Her love whips hard
Like wind and stands in eager pain.
She wins your thoughts
And drives your inner planes.
She clears and shares
A love that never strains.
She lives in a time of her own...
You have always heard her speaking,
She's always been in your ear.
Her voice sounds a tone within you,
Listen to the words you hear.
Her time has no past or future,
She lives everything she sees.
Her time doesn't spin outside here,
It's in every breath she breaths.
She lives in a time of her own...
Her eyes like light reflect the aura of her hair.
She sends, attends, behind an alpha stare.
She seeks the stars and spirals up their stairs.
She lives in a time of her own.
She lives in a time of her own.
she lives in a time of her own.
she lives in a time of her own.

Slip Inside This House 
Bedoin tribes ascending
From the egg into the flower,
Alpha information sending
State within the heaven shower
From disciples the unending
Subtleties of river power
They slip inside this house as they pass by
If your limbs begin dissolving
In the water that you tread
All surroundings are evolving
In the stream that clears your head
Find yourself a caravan
Like Noah must have led
And slip inside this house as you pass by.
Slip inside this house as you pass by.
True conception, knowing why
Brings even more than meets the eye
Slip inside this house as you pass by.
In this dark we call creation
We can be and feel and know
From an effort, comfort station
That's surviving on the go
There's infinite survival in
The high baptismal glow.
Slip inside this house as you pass by.
There is no season when you are grown
You are always risen from the seeds you've sown
There is no reason to rise alone
Other stories given have sages of their own.
Live where your heart can be given
And your life starts to unfold
In the forms you envision
In this dream that's ages old
On the river layer is the only sayer
You receive all you can hold
Like you've been told.
Every day's another dawning
Give the morning winds a chance
Always catch your thunder yawning
Lift your mind into the dance
Sweep the shadows from your awning
Shrink the fourfold circumstance
That lies outside this house don't pass it by.
Higher worlds that you uncover
Light the path you want to roam
You compare there and discover
You won't need a shell of foam
Twice born gypsies care and keep
The nowhere of their former home
They slip inside this house as they pass by.
Slip inside this house as you pass by.
You think you can't, you wish you could
I know you can, I wish you would
Slip inside this house as you pass by.
Four and twenty birds of Maya
Baked into an atom you
Polarized into existence
Magnet heart from red to blue
To such extent the realm of dark
Within the picture it seems true
But slip inside this house and then decide.
All your lightning waits inside you
Travel it along your spine
Seven stars receive your visit
Seven seals remain divine
Seven churches filled with spirit,
Treasure from the angels' mine
Slip inside this house as you pass by.
Slip inside this house as you pass by.
The space you make has your own laws
No longer human gods are cause
The center of this house will never die.
There is no season when you are grown
You are always risen from the seeds you've sown
There is no reason to rise alone
Other stories given have sages of their own.
Draw from the well of unchanging
Its union nourishes on
In the right re-arranging
Till the last confusion is gone
Water-brothers trust in the ultimust
Of the always singing song they pass along.
One-eyed men aren't really reigning
They just march in place until
Two-eyed men with mystery training
Finally feel the power fill
Three-eyed men are not complaining.
They can yo-yo where they will
They slip inside this house as they pass by.
Don't pass it by.

And though it's new, 
your image cuts me like a knife.
And now I'm home.

Thru The Rhythm 
Thru the rhythm of darkened times
Painted black by knowledge crimes
And repetitions pointless mime
Instilling values the sick define
That keeps the fabric that keeps you blind
And ties your hands and cloaks your mind
But on my stilts, I'm above the slime
Come on up if you can make the climb, but who am I?
Who am I? Who am I?
I've smelled the stench from the fumes that rise
From the books that rehash the same old lies
I felt the panic that they disguise
In the forms of laws of every size
I've heard the teachers whine and make me drop out like flies
But you know they teach you nonsense, cause they can't blind your eyes
I've seen the fools gold that they pawn off as their prize
To the average standard the norm supplies, but where am I?
Where am I? Where am I?
You've gobbled all the blessings they caused you to digest
They may be hard to swallow, but they keep your tongue depressed
Your scattered whims were born depressed
So when something slams your chest
You flutter about, you're sleek distressed
And when you stop to ease your breast
A scattered rim leaves you obsessed
While solid thoughts are soon suppressed, but where are you?
Oh, where are you? Hey! Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?

Better Off 
I'm sitting here thinking again, 
just wondering if I'll see you again 
life has been hard like it always has, 
But just like always my problems will pass 
You were the reason my life sucked so hard 
You're so lucky I took up guitar 
You see, if I didn't have music as an escape, 
I would have jumped you one night and beat in your face 
But you see now, i'm not like that anymore 
I have moved on but you'll always be a dirty whore 
I know it sounds harsh, but I just speak the truth 
(Chorus:) You were my friend, my best friend at that 
but we broke apart and you became fat 
You ruined my life and I only wish, 
That I never met you, 
Mich you're a bitch! 
Jr. High was a terrible time and all because of you 
You got pissed because he chose me over you. 
Haha! Now you see you don't always get what you want you selfish little brat! 
So just learn to deal with that. 
It's not that hard, honest, I promise 
but you'll never change, that's too hard for you to do 
(Chorus) 
After all that has happened, 
I'm only happy about one thing 
That being I've rid myself of you 
Now I have no regrets and I don't feel sorry 
At least I know I'm the stronger woman for it, but you! 
You will forever be a child

Brian 
Why is it that every time you fall in love your heart gets broken? 
No matter what you do it always happens 
Just look at me and use me as an example 
I fell in love with a boy, 
he could care less, he was an ass 
I was just weak, 
or ignorant some may say, 
but I knew what went on at the creek that day 
We were a couple and everyone knew 
but you took her down to have some fun, 
forgetting about me 
Chorus: I found out but didn't do a thing 
I loved you too much to confront you 
I knew if I did I might lose you 
I could not stand being alone 
So we went on as if nothing had happened 
Then two months later it happened again 
You took her down to the rocks, 
this time a different girl 
Bored and lonely I then took a walk 
and came to that spot, 
That's when I found you with her on top of you 
And quickly I left and acted as if I never knew 
Chorus 
Then one day I was with your friend 
He told me all but I would still pretend to, 
not know was how I wanted it to be. 
His friend got fed up and he threatened me 
not only me but the relationship, 
I hate him now that little bitch! 
He told my guy that we messed around 
and wouldn't listen at all 
He just walked off, 
head up looking tall 
I went to the room to sit and think, 
but instead I burst into tears 
I loved you but you didn't care 
Two years it has been  
I have seen you with my friend 
I only pray that she 
has the strength that I lacked 
Chorus

Fend For Myself 
VERSE Are you there? Can you listen?
Or will you shut me out
pretend I don't exsist?
As you have
every other time
Am I here? Do you see me?
Or am I once again invisible?
Shoved in the back of your mind
You never understood
You never really cared
You never saw who I was
CHORUS And I sit here, crying
trying to make you see
As I walk out the door
you still don't understand
That I'm never coming back
You chose her over me
Distracted by her spell
You left me to fend for myself
VERSE I wonder if there is a chance
I'd like it to work
but it never will
I'm gone, do you notice?
My spirit and cheer have vanished
but you'll never know
cuz you don't care
Or do you?
Suddenly in this battle
you put up a fight
wanting me all to your own
selfishness glows
love has vanished
you want me just to say you were there
CHORUS REPEAT
BRIDGE I had hoped it would work out
Perhaps your heart would melt
but it's over, be gone
I'm scarred, are you happy?
You'll never see what your missing
Good-bye

You protected me from the evils around me and I consider you a sister, Kelly

Just so I could spend time with you 
We all stayed together and made it through 
I finally grew up and had to leave 
I cried so much I could hardly breathe 
You calmed me down and then I felt relieved knowing that you'd always be there for me 
Chorus 
Just so you know, 
you're a big part of my life and you will never be forgotten

Ode To GC 
Walking down the street, home is my destination 
listening and singing the "Motivation Proclamation" 
Listening to the lyrics, I am blown away 
I remember everything that had happened that day 
It was the day after my birthday and the cd had come out that day 
I saved up my money and rushed out 
I bought the album and took it home 
I put it in my cd player and just fell in love 
The lyrics were hypnotic and the voices so beautiful 
I fell head over heels for the music 
Throughout the album I had laughed and I cried, 
I also giggled and sighed 
To know that you all went through so much, it really did touch me. 
Chorus: Good Charlotte, this is for you 
Listeing to you, I always made it through 
You made me feel so good about myself, so this is for you I met you at the Warped Tour and I sat outside your bus. You came out, signed autographs and took pictures. 
You were even kind ebough to talk to us 
Some sweet things were said, oh how I thank you 
They mean so much, I will alwyas love you 
Just as long as you are always around, I'll be a fan representin' from my little unknown town 
Chorus 
Just remember to stay together 
and we'll meet you on the stage 
lights shining brightly and the music blasting 
We'll see you when we get there.

Punk Like Me 
My kind of guy isn't that ordinary 
He has to have tattoos and piercings 
and be a hardcore punk just like me 
If he doesn't like Rancid and the Casualties 
Then go ahead and say good bye to him for me 
Chorus: If you're a mod, I don't want ya 
If you're a prep, see ya later 
If you're a poser, you're nothing but a loser 
I need a hardcore punk who's just like me 
I want him to be dyed and grungy 
Sportin' bondage and band tees 
He's got to be cool, but also an ass 
That's my kind of guy I want nothing less 
Chorus: 
In the end he's got to be a sweetie 
Not an ass, no not to me 
I need respect, that's not asking much 
If you've got these qualities 
Then you're good for me

Ter um lugar pra morar

O que morre pelo ar
Que brinca pelo ar como coisa natural

Voz do corao deixou oh! oh! oh!
E pergunta sempre onde andar

Seu claro me bate
No  o mesmo
De uma lua, carrossel de prata
Que no esqueci
Seu claro me bate
Me faz de alvo
Mas ficou tarde
E eu a via
Muito mais bonita do que ela 
Parece que a noite
Guardava meus sonhos
No fundo da mata
Num cu de estrelas
No meio das guas
No leito do rio
No brilho das pedras
Debaixo do cho
Onde eu ia me encontrar
No meio da cidade
Seu claro me bate
No  o mesmo
De uma lua, carrossel de prata
Que no esqueci
Seu claro me bate
Mas no consigo
Achar de novo
O rosto amigo
Que eu amava muito
Muito tempo atrs

Nos Bailes Da Vida 
(M. Nascimento - Fernando Brant, 1981)
Foi nos bailes da vida
Ou num bar em troca de po
Que muita gente boa ps o p na profisso
De tocar um instrumento e de cantar
No se importando se quem pagou quis ouvir
Foi assim
Cantar era buscar o caminho que vai dar no sol
Tenho comigo as lembranas do que eu era
Para cantar nada era longe, tudo to bom
'T a estrada de terra na bolia de caminho
Era assim
Com a roupa encharcada e a alma repleta de cho
Todo artista tem de ir aonde o povo est
Se foi assim, assim ser
Cantando me disfaro e no me canso de viver
Nem de cantar

Pedra Bonita 
Leio nas pedras um velho e claro sinal
 Traos da escrita rupestre de algum ancestral
 Linda viagem, visagem, mensagem de amor
 Sol das cavernas, estradas eternas me vou
 Amanheceu, vai alm
 Tem nas mos girassis
 Brinca de ser o que for
 Brilham cem mil faris
 Salta do nada, desata e dana ao redor
 Tocam tambores nas tabas, nas selvas irms
 Sai do silncio, serena, serena cano
 Joga os deuses por terra se tens corao
 Diz sorridente ao cigano que o sonho vingou
 Sai do abandono e ouvirs as estrelas de luz
 Sai do silncio, serena, serena cano
 Brinca de ser o que for
 Tem nas mos girassis
 Gravo a laser histria que ainda no sei
 Riscos da arte capricho da sorte que vem
 Dorme um sono tranqilo na casa da paz
 Risca na pedra bonita o nome do amor

 Busca chegar
 Onde possa se transformar
 Numa brisa
 Pra transportar e guardar

 Os pequenos murmrios
 Folhas tristes do outono
 E o jeito do amor
 Sigo no rumo da manh
 Rindo sozinho
 Dos pensamentos que tenho
 Com festa e vinho
 O ar da noite sopro de vida
 Me lembrando
 O que eu esqueo existir

Se era uma vez
Castelos de papel
Gnomos e cristais
Motivos de canes
Decerto so pequenas maravilhas
Duendes brincalhes
E desanoiteceu
Na saga dos anes
Na luz de cada olhar
Na trilha das formigas
Nas estrelas
Em cada grilo
Quem descobrir tamanha grandeza
Ver a tribo a danar ao rito da chuva
Ser a festa da terra a nova semente
As folhas pelo cho
O branco algodo
As lgrimas de amor
As prolas marfim
Os frutos da suprema natureza
O raio multicor
Um feixe de luar
Lembranas e quintais
E tudo que sonhar
Aviva o pas das maravilhas

Cigarras e flores, contos de fadas
No h um bem maior que a pequena criana

Todo Azul Do Mar 
(F. Venturini - R. Bastos)
Foi assim, como ver o mar
A primeira vez que meus olhos
Se viram no seu olhar
No tive a inteno de me apaixonar
Mera distrao e j era
Momento de se gostar
Quando eu dei por mim
Nem tentei fugir do visgo que me prendeu
Dentro do seu olhar
Quando eu mergulhei no azul do mar
Sabia que era amor
E vinha pra ficar
Daria pra pintar todo o azul do cu
Dava pra encher o universo
Da vida que eu quis pra mim
Tudo que eu fiz foi me confessar
Escravo do seu amor
Livre pra amar
Quando eu mergulhei fundo nesse olhar
Fui dono do mar azul
De todo o azul do mar
Foi assim, como ver o mar
Foi a primeira vez que eu vi o mar
Onda azul, todo o azul do mar
Daria pra beber todo o azul do mar
Foi quando mergulhei no azul do mar...

Old Bitch, New Rock 
My old bitch is new rock, in a sense 
Repetitive and useless like a bad dream 
She nagged away like their shitty guitars 
And her tits were just like their riffs 
(Fucking Terrible) 
The love she gave me was their guitar solo 
It didn't fucking go nowhere 
The love she gave me was their lyrics 
Exaggerated and Meaningless 
Todays rock is like a fucking bitch 
You wanna fuck her, but she says she aint ready 
When the fuck will rock ever be ready? 
How long will we have to put up with this shit? 
I've moved on from my old bitch 
She lied and cheated 
I've moved on from new rock 
Rock has been defeated 
They go hand in hand 
Both driven by money 
They go hand in hand 
Both boring and not funny 
Todays rock is like a fucking bitch 
You wanna fuck her, but she says she aint ready 
When the fuck will rock ever be ready? 
How long will we have to put up with this shit? 
If only new rock were porn 
If only new rock was awesome 
It's true, rock is dead 
We can only wait and hope 
Rock now is like that fucking bitch 
Too fucking tight, taking no risks 
Never wanting to try anything new 
All repetitive shit

The Party That Sucked 
VERSE 1: 
How did I not see the deceit? 
Cruel lies are hidden 
Cruel lies and the truth 
All too well hidden 
VERSE 2: 
You're a liar, you're a cheat, you've destroyed me 
It's time for my revenge 
It is not rape I speak of 
I wouldn't give you the satisfaction 
BRIDGE 1: 
Though they say we all make mistakes 
Lieing, hiding the truth 
In an inward manner 
Is such an unforgivable mistake 
Yet you're surprised that its true 
Obviously you don't know what truth is 
VERSE 3: 
It wouldn't please me more to see you, 
With your throat at the edge of a steel blade 
Your lieing eyes gouging with a sharp fork 
Your entire body being steadily unmade 
CHORUS: 
Pay for the lies with your life 
The lies to me, 
The lies to many 
Pay for your deceit with emotional violence 
No rape at all 
Just realisation 
Defeat 
VERSE 4: 
You lied to me, but I wasn't the only one 
You told me you loved me, but I was just one 
The other deserves the truth, 
The ugly truth that you lie to avoid 
VERSE 5: 
You couldn't find the courage 
You could only steer clear of the iceberg 
An Iceberg of lies, of hidden truths 
You are too cowardly to face it 
CHORUS: 
Pay for the lies with your life 
The lies to me, 
The lies to many 
Pay for your deceit with emotional violence 
No rape at all 
Just realisation 
Defeat 
BRIDGE 2: 
The iceberg will melt one day 
The truth will unravel 
The truth will make you crumble 
You will suffer from your own mistake 
There will be no need for you to be defeated 
You will defeat yourself

As night falls we left Japan 
With half a ton of contraband
Tight black shirts and pink armbands
Don't tell our parents, they wouldn't understand

Or being the first to play
All of Tokyo's latest games
Don't play dumb
You're not ignorant of its happening

Involved in illegal game trafficking
They won't understand

Burried 
I wasted all this time
With you my dear
As you masquerade
and tell yourself a thousand lies
If you say two and one is five
Then you're right
Along those lines just say
That all we ever do is fight
I can't pretend that I don't miss you
I think I will
Take the time to get over it
I think I'll bury it
and I shoulda just said good-bye
Cause you're wasting my time
I'm sick of losing games
Cause you make the rules
I'm never more alone
Then anytime I spent with you
Aren't you so pretty
Pretty what I think it's
Time for you to fill that line
You're right here
But I can't hear your voice right now

About almost everything
Time gets counted out as I forget

Memories don't last forever
I hear you're married now
You won't return my phone calls

Do you think about me

???Cause I adore you.

Just the fact that I'm in this band

If I was a lucky guy, you know I'd be standing there by your side
I wanna hold your hand so tight.
And I would write for you hundreds of love songs

Jeanni please like me
I'll make your life feel so complete
Does the fact that I wrote this song 
Mean you'll be here before too long?
If I was a lucky guy, you know I'd be standing there by your side
I wanna hold your hand so tight.
And I would sing to you all of these dumb love songs.
???Cause I adore you.
In time I know I'll drop the line
I know I'll give you a call to ask you out
And I know the things that you do
will make me feel alright
In time I know I'll drop the line
I know I'll give you a call to ask you out
I know you'll come to the shows 
To watch me sing those songs about you
I know everything will be alright someday
If you would just be my forever
I'll promise I'll say never
Always and I know that you will be there for me
I don't know what else to say for you
If I was a lucky guy, you know I'd be standing there by your side
I wanna hold your hand so tight.

Last Kiss Goodnight 
Stare a million miles from here
It's evident that I'm too scared
To try and forget of the past and move ahead
I'll try again
Scared tryin hard just to forget
And I'll placate thought with self distress
Pleading cases to courts with deafened ears
Over again
Couple mixed drinks couple beers
And I'll forget you're not here
And oh...clear your taste out
There you walked away from here
Wait just one moment I swear
I'll make some sense of this tonight
Just one more time I'll sit alone

space smiles wide on your end
I can't feel right
salt dragging on my insides
Please steal these eyes
no longer watching say good-bye
I'll stay, Here alone
This Direction, Unknown
I'll stay, Here alone
Misdirection
Stare at the sky
I wonder where your eyes are
I can't feel right
Salt dragging on my insides
Please steal these eyes
No longer watching say goodnight
As we separate our lives
Symbolic as the sunrise
As it gets consumed by night
It hasn't been the same
Since missing both our eyes

Out Of Place 
Punctuate destruction
With your chosen circumstance
Things that fall are rebuilt
But they're missing what they had
So I think that I
I will lie face down in the sand
And wait for the tide to come in
Everything here has fallen out of place
And I've grown tired of the taste
There's nothing here
Everything here has fallen out of place
And I've grown tired of the taste
Of my own tears
I'm starting not to care
It's all that's making sense now
Please give me my heart back
Take my pride and keep the change
Every single word said
Was a meaningless extange

Where Are You 
BAND: 16 Bit
Released as a single in 1986.
Written by Luca Anzilotti, later of Snap! From the sleeve notes,
It seems the line "Where are you?" is spoken by Sven Vath...
Where Are You?
Man was not sick
Until he sold out to the Devil.
I know the remedy for your sickness.
Where are you?
Where are you?
I've lost you
If you are a child of God,
If you want to set you free and heal your disease,
Join hands and let us stand up to the Evil.
Where are you?
Where are you?
I've lost you
I've lost you
Even if you're not a believer in the Almighty,
It's never too late to confess your sins.
Come with me I will show you the way!
Where are you?
Where are you?
I've lost you
Do you want to waste the rest of your precious life
With sex and drugs?
Oh no, God have mercy!
Remember you will pay on judgement day.
The time has come to exorcise the Devil
In you!!
Where are you?
Where are you?
I've lost you

Heaven Still Cries 
and by the time, 
the green is gone the air is thick, 
the water's black and what can help us bring it back 
and by the time, 
the damage's done we think about the years to come and wonder 
people ask why? 
when I return in my own home 
I often question the use of things that we all own, 
I guess you will see that what we got, 
we don't need can only lead 2 greed 
people ask why, 
heaven still cries 
people ask why, 
heaven still cries 
there was a time we didn't know 
but things were all natural then, 
and if we take a look at the sky we see it cryin'

Subtle Movements 
The subtle movements of her eyes said it all
Made my thoughts wonder of, couldn't get enough
The perfume of this girl, in front of me, is killin' me
This soultrip rolls along this road
Straight into the unknown is where I wanna go
I'm losing my head, losing my head over her
Spinning round and round so fast
When she touches me and I see her smile
She makes it all worthwhile
Spinning round and round so fast I believe she
Makes me whole, I never felt this much alive
So divine, she's pure, shes beautiful
And on days like this in the autumn winds
I feel that all I am is about her, about her
Spinning round and round so fast
When she touches me and I see her smile
She makes it all worthwhile
Spinning round and round so fast I believe she
Makes me whole, I never felt this much alive
She makes it all worthwhile  (4x)
Spinning round and round so fast
When she touches me and I see her smile
She makes it all worthwhile
Spinning round and round so fast I believe she
Makes me whole, I never felt this much alive
Much alive

I find my self killing thoughts in me
Is all this really meant to be
Is all of this the devil's sympathy
Once I got drunk
And I hit the floor
Head on the ground

Then everything came clear to me
The day that I met you (2x)
The dream that saved me
The day nothing mattered anymore
I feel alive and it's down to you
I could do anything that I want to do
All this was meant to be
I feel lucky now
You're a part of me
The day that I met you (2x)
The dream that saved me
The day nothing mattered anymore
I carved your name in a piece of wood
To make it last, to make it feel good
I carved your name in a piece of wood
To make it last, to make it feel good
I carved your name in a piece of wood
To make it last, to make it feel good

Song: "Bring Me Back"
Album: Life's Interpretation
I remember the times before
When I lived across
You never came out
You always stood right to the window
Watching as the childrens play
Then the years passed, we finally met up, 
Became best friends
Till you moved as I
Got older, looking at the calm outside
It's too quiet and lonely
(Chorus)
Looking back at the times before
A few years gone, it's an endless story
Bring me back to the way I am
Bring me back to what I was inside
Now I see the lonely street
As I drive by each passing light poles
As I fly off land
I see this place looks dark and grim
Falling asleep, thinking back
When I had so much fun
Being with you so I
I won't forget all those times we had
It's in my memories as I... 
(horus)
Now
I have seen the truth
I have made my own mistakes
Can't regret what I've done
(horus 2x)

I have seen the truth
I have made my own mistakes
Can't regret what I've done

Song: "Careless"
Album: Life's Interpretation
You said you're sorry but
It's happening again
You're so unreal, 
So impossible to be a friend
When I needed you, 
You turn your back on me
I cover for you, you won't
Do the same for me
Chorus:
You just stand there watching me
Fall out of my sanity
I've gone one way, strapped to drown
I'll rise again, I wont stay down
Every time I hear a cry, 
It's all in my head
Forget what I'll see, 
I'll wash away all I bled
Your lies left me in
This fallen state of mind
I'd throw it all away, 
I've pushed memories aside
(Chorus)
If I hide my face, you wouldn't know
How much is enough
Your careless thoughts
They left me all dried up

Don't bite the hands (that)
Feeds all of you
You do not feel this
You took for granted
All of the things that
You cannot see
Will eat you up
Will eat you
Don't play the game (that)
You know you'd lose
If you don't want to
Suffer like they do
Then listen to me
Don't pull the trigger
Don't pull the trigger
Don't pull it back
Wounds that won't heal
Shall I pray for
My redemption? 
Shall I spill this? 
Chorus:
I will not fall off
Like them, like them
Take them down
I shall stand aside
With you, with you
We won't fail
Don't lose your way (on)
The path that you chose
It would have led you
To where you want to
Away from here
Away from them
Away from hell
Away from hell
Wounds that won't heal
Shall I pray for
My redemption? 
Shall I spill this?

Go ahead and force your sons to their executions
Go ahead and force your sons, for the money

Go ahead and forget your shame, it's what you want
Go ahead and tell everyone how proud you are
Go ahead and eat your meal, forget why you did
Go ahead and take their lives, you know you want to
Go ahead and cut their tongues, it's not worth it
You know you don't want to, want to listen
Get up, get up tell that to your father
Get up, get up tell that to your mother
Get up, get up tell that to your master
Get up, get up tell that to everyone

Wait a minute! 
He joined the military not because he wanted to, right? 
He joined the military because you forced him into it! 
You wanted to make money off of him, didn't you?! 
You used all your money for your luxuries
What happened to the college fund that you were saving? 
Where is it?! 
You didn't save any college fund! 
What did you do to the money?! 
That's right... you used all your money
For all the affairs you've had! 
How many children do you have?! 
Get up, get up tell that to your father
Get up, get up tell that to your mother
Get up, get up tell that to your master
Get up, get up tell that to everyone
Get up, get up tell that to your father
Get up, get up tell that to your mother
Get up, get up tell that to your master
Get up, get up tell that to everyone
Get up, get up tell that to your father
Get up, get up tell that to your mother
Get up, get up tell that to your master
Get up, get up tell that to everyone
Get up, get up tell that to everyone

Red Glasses 
Left me alone on Sunday
My heart pales for your reason
I cannot carry on now
I bleed for your sympathy
And when you took my love away
You saw what was within my soul
Chorus:
I never would have thought that it would end
Why do I even bother
To try again
Nothing will ever change
What I've felt
Crying on a Monday morning
Up until Tuesday afternoon
I cannot carry on now
I'm faking my own happiness
And when you took my love away
You saw what was within my soul
(Chorus)

Unwelcome 
16 Droenz
Song: "Unwelcome"
Album: Life's Interpretation
Wouldn't you like to know
What this, what this is all about
Doesn't it ever show
That you, that you can't accept the facts
You walked out on me
Now you, now you regret leaving me all alone
You lost all my respect
And you, and you cry by my door
Chorus:
What do you expect me to do now
You wasted all your welcome
I'd like to make you feel how
I felt when you said our love was done
Nothing in the world works your way
Just leave, just leave it alone
Things you left behind
Don't mean, don't mean a thing anymore
You said you never needed me
Why you, why you still here
You lost all my respect
And you, and you cry by my door
(Chorus)
Bridge:
It doesn't really matter anymore
So why don't you just proceed
To the things that you use to do
Cause I don't really look forward to
The times that we used to meet
Please just leave
Cause today all I see
Is another memory
(Chorus 2x)

Where It Ends 
Look at me, I'm not what you need
If you think that I should catch you everytime you fall
I have tried, but there are too many places you hide
I didn't wanna hurt you, 
This is gonna hurt you.
I don't wanna see you fall, 
But I can't be holdin' on
To the same mistakes we always make, 
And here's where it ends.
So tell me that, 
Do you understand? 
There's no way that we could ever be the same.
I didn't wanna hurt you, 
This is gonna hurt you.
I don't wanna see you fall, 
But I can't be holdin' on
To the same mistakes we always make, 
And here's where it ends.
Ohh, ohh
And here's where it ends.
It ends, it ends, 
For you and me.
It ends, it ends, it ends.
So tell me that, 
Do you understand? 
There's no way that we could ever be the same.
And this is gonna hurt you, 
I never meant to hurt you, 
Cause I'm going away.
I don't wanna see you fall
But I can't be holdin' on
To the same mistakes we always make, 
And here's where... 
I don't wana see you fall
But I can't be holdin' on
To the same mistakes we always make, 
And here's where it ends.
Ohh, Ohhh

Don't go 'round tonight

Hope you are quite prepared to die

This is the room, the start of it all
No portrait so fine, only sheets on the wall

And the bodies obtained, the bodies obtained
Where will it end?
These are your friends,
from childhood through youth
Who goaded you on, demanded full proof
Withdrawal pain's hard, it can do you right in
So distorted and thin, distorted and thin
Where will it end?
This is the car at the edge of the road
There's nothing disturbed,
all the windows are closed
I guess you were right, when we talked in the heat
There's no room for the weak,
no room for the weak
Where will it end?

Through childhood, through youth,

Teachers 
(Leonard Cohen)
I met a woman long ago
her hair the black that black can go,
Are you a teacher of the heart?
Soft she answered no.
I met a girl across the sea,
her hair the gold that gold can be,
Are you a teacher of the heart?
Yes, but not for thee.
I met a man who lost his mind
in some lost place I had to find,
follow me the wise man said,
but he walked behind.
I walked into a hospital
where none was sick and none was well,
when at night the nurses left
I could not walk at all.
Morning came and then came noon,
dinner time a scalpel blade
lay beside my silver spoon.
Some girls wander by mistake
into the mess that scalpels make.
Are you the teachers of my heart?
We teach old hearts to break.
One morning I woke up alone,
the hospital and the nurses gone.
Have I carved enough my Lord?
Child, you are a bone.
I ate and ate and ate,
no I did not miss a plate, well
How much do these suppers cost?
We'll take it out in hate.
I spent my hatred everyplace,
on every work on every face,
someone gave me wishes
and I wished for an embrace.
Several girls embraced me, then
I was embraced by men,
Is my passion perfect?
No, do it once again.
I was handsome I was strong,
I knew the words of every song.
Did my singing please you?
No, the words you sang were wrong.
Who is it whom I address,
who takes down what I confess?
Are you the teachers of my heart?
We teach old hearts to rest.
Oh teachers are my lessons done?
I cannot do another one.
They laughed and laughed and said, Well child,
are your lessons done?
are your lessons done?

The Partisan 
(Leonard Cohen)
When they poured across the border
I was cautioned to surrender,
this I could not do;
I took my gun and vanished.
I have changed my name so often,
I've lost my wife and children
but I have many friends,
and some of them are with me.
An old woman gave us shelter,
Kept us hidden in the garret,
then the soldiers came;
she died without a whisper.
There were three of us this morning
I'm the only one this evening
but I must go on;
the frontiers are my prison.
Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing,
through the graves the wind is blowing,
freedom soon will come;
then we'll come from the shadows.
Les Allemands e'taient chez moi,
ils me dirent, 
Rsigne toi,
mais je n'ai pas peur;
j'ai repris mon me.
[The Germans were at my home
They said, 
Sign yourself,
But I am not afraid
I have retaken my soul.]
J'ai change' cent fois de nom,
j'ai perdu femme et enfants
mais j'ai tant d'amis;
j'ai la France entie're.
[I've changed names a hundred times
I have lost wife and children
But I have so many friends
I have all of France]
Un vieil homme dans un grenier
pour la nuit nous a cache',
les Allemands l'ont pris;
il est mort sans surprise.
[An old man, in an attic
Hid us for the night
The Germans captured him
He died without surprise.]

Walking fast
Faces pass and I'm home bound 
Staring blankly ahead 
Just making my way
I'm making my way 
Through the crowd
And I need you
And I miss you 
And now I wonder
If I could fall into the sky 
Do you think time would pass me by
Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles
If I could just see you.... tonight
It's always times like these 
When I think of you 
And wonder if you ever think of me
Cause everything's so wrong 
And I don't belong 
Living in your precious memory
Cause I need you
And I miss you 
And now I wonder
If I could fall into the sky
Do you think time would pass me by 
Cause you know I'd walk a thousand miles 
If I could just see you.... tonight

I remember when, the shock set in, 
and knocked the wind out of me, 
like it was yesterday. 
The look of an empty chair, mom's still there, 
dinner's prepared, the usual, can I be excused? 
Lay me down, and I'll pull you through, 
When I'm underground, I'll mean more to you, 
when you can't sleep at night, I'll make it alright, 
Live your life, as I watch over you. 
And no one understands, the life we live, 
we live to love, then lose it all. Where are you now? 
Why'd I have to go, and lose one of the two things 
I needed most? I'm sick of this. 
Try to get some sleep, numb from head to feet. 
All these restless dreams, lie inside of me. 
A broken lonely boy, with nowhere. 
If I could just go up, but I'll never know. 
I left a note for you, and I got yours too. 
Hopefully it helps what I'm going through. 
And in it what was said right after your dead. 
Was how much of myself I was going to miss

Check Your Life At The Door 
Verse
This is the end of all that's real.
Tell all the angels how you feel,
I'm sorry, I've stolen,
I've cheated, and I'm broken.
Every right will have it's wrong,
Did you leave love to carry on.
I'm faithful, but fading,
I'm wide eyed, and waiting.
Chorus
Mothers and Daughters, Fathers and Others,
I hope you understand.
If love is nothing, nothing is something.
Oh God I hope I'm right.
Cynics and Sinners, Losers and Winners,
Lay down your final hand.
Gamble your chances, crush your defenses.
You'll hope to God I'm right.
Verse
Wasting time's not an option,
So take my precise precaution.
I'm locked up, and keyless,
It's all been, meaningless.
And now that we're all on the same page,
Do you think these prayers will keep you safe?
Their hiding, the truth.

Has the cold thawed your heart again? 
Can it still beat and bleed just like others people can? 
Can emotions be seen in your eyes? 
Is it just another sense in your body, that's burned and died. 
Contagious. 
Chorus 
Everyday was the same she'd come over, 
We'd laugh all day, than we'd kiss, and I'd hold her. 
something's changed on the way, now she's not okay. 
She never talks anymore it frustrates, 
when she does it's complaints and she's angry, 
How many times can I say that I'm sorry. 
Verse 
You're not the same girl that I knew, 
You're jaded, serated, the devil's here, and now he's inside of you. 
And I pray one day you'll come back to me. 
At the sky I stare, with my hand's in the air, wish and believe.

Hey, I'm gonna sweep you away,
Faster than cascade, I'll take your breath away.

And stop, just let it all go.
you're gonna feel somethings, 
From head to toe.
Interlude
Girl you know, I know you want it, just as bad as me.
Come on let's go I swear Ill show you, that these sheets were made for you.
Into the night, this endless fight, that leaves us breathless, bodies still.
And when the sun is rising up, I'll be there right beside you

We Can't Afford Romance 
Like guns and flowers
We're just different people
Waiting for our time to go inside
Wait for the passion to fill
our stricken hearts, that will burn inside
again
Out of everyone, you know me best
The breath from my lungs, the beats from my chest
Out of everyone, you took the time to see
What seemed impossible, 
And all our lives, we have tried
to fill this void, with another hole
like guns and flowers, we're just different people, waiting for our time to go inside
wait for the passion, to fill our stricken hearts that will burn inside again
Is this destiny or just the death of me
Will we figure out a reason to believe
i've lost everything thats gotten close to me
if your not the one, then just let me say
and all our lives, we have tried
to fill this void with another hole
like guns and flowers
we're just different people, waiting for our time to go inside, wait for the passion to fill our stricken hearts that will burn inside again
lets set our hearts on fire
sit back and watch them burn
watch all the blood turn black
wait for the rainfall,breath back all the steam
there still inside of me, let love flow again, life is beginning
life is beginning
like guns and flowers, we're just different people waiting for our time to go inside
wait for the passion to fill our stricken hearts that will burn inside again
like guns and flowers, we're just different people waiting for our time to go inside
wait for the passion to fill our stricken hearts that will burn inside again

A Cloth Like Gauze 
But it got stuck as i'm coming down 
The way the sound moves when i hit the ground 
A low, lower than i've ever been in 
Shot so hard it stung like pins 
The last time i drown my head 
One last time before i go to bed 
Buried underneath and getting farther lost 
Turning this into a cloth like gauze 
A cloth like gauze 
But it got thick as i'm going down 
The way i fall apart when i turn around 
A low, lower than i've ever been 
It came so hard it made me spin 
The last time you burn your friends 
One last time before the burden ends 
Buried underneath and getting farther lost 
Turning this into a cloth like gauze 
A cloth like gauze 
People just let me down 
I'd rather be all alone by myself 
Just the same as every face 
Another hole in the human race

Alkali 
My skin is opaque
Like white seaweed
Shallow and weak
I have no feeling
See through me
(nothing ever makes it through)
See through me
(even though i promised it)
Most worthless shell
Like a ghost in a dream
Cantisending life
Like satin white sheath
Can I ask you something?
Do you see me near you?
Slowly going over it
Alkali
You make it all clear
Nothing makes it better
You make it all clear
Nothing makes it better

And I Find 
One day my head filled up with though
One day I said I would never get caught
One day I explored all the possible ways
One day I swore, I would understand it
Iopen up
I dream awake
I open up,
And I dream
One night my good intentions turned me away
One night I left my hell and found out I'd stayed
One night I became all the people I hate
One night I swore, I would never relate
I open up
I dream awake
I open up,
And I dream
And I find
There is light
There is hope
There is a glow

And I Go 
Its become apparent 
In my head the little machine 
In the light i'm quite transparent 
In the dark, i'm such a dream 
There are two sides to me 
Sometimes i set the evil one free 
Cause i'm in love with the devil 
And she's in love with me 
And i go, and i go away 
Sometimes i lose myself 
Sometimes in a bad way 
It's never ending im going to hell 
As long as you go with me 
When your down you'll only want it more 
Isn't it nature to break somebody's heart 
And I go, and I go away 
I wont treat you wrong 
And i wont treat you bad 
And in my eyes tonight 
And if your all alone 
I will be your only

Darkest Before Dawn 
If I was living to be free, I don't see that anymore 
I was just trying to be me, but the walls and the wars won't let me be 
There's always something, to remind me what to do 
There's always someway, to get back to you 
Just let me know, when you need my faith 
I'll be there to fly away with you, with you 
I know someday we'll make it work, and I know that the rain will clear the way 
I know someday we'll take it home, and I know that the pain will clear the way 
There's always something, to remind me of you 
There's always a way to take me there 
Just let me know, when you need a hand 
I'll be there to be with you, with you 
And it's always darkest, before dawn 
And when the sun comes out, all the rain is gone, it's gone 
I was making my head up, and you know it would fall down 
All the weight of the world has got me on the ground 
'Cause it's always darkest, before dawn 
And when the sun comes on, all the rain is gone, it's gone

Dissarm you and your smile
And cut you like you want me to
Cut that little child
Silently in search of part of you
The letter's burned

What I choose is it my choice?
It's a voice, it comes to you too
It's killing me, it's killing you, my love
To send a smile over to you
Dissarm you and your smile
And leave you like they left me here
To wither in denial
The bitterness of one who's left allone
The leader's burned, the leader's burned
I used to be a little boy, now I'm so old, in my shoes

And i resent you 
I deceive you too 
I reinvent you 
And i believe in you 
And i defend you 
Cause you know what to do

Belief is so untrue 
It wont make it easier it wont make it strong 
You want it forever you want it so wrong 
Your breathing in circles 
Your leaving inside 
Breaking in pieces it wont ever die 
I walk around you 
I am the other side 
Keep things from you 
Wait until it's time 
I move so slowly 
I am the lowly one 
I found in waiting 
The deception won

On dirty knees like dirty needs breed dirty seeds

Everyday Everything 
I walk around looking down almost everyday 
And look at me less the pain left along the way 
Less the pride left aside like a yesterday 
Useless me useless me like a runaway 
Say you fight me everyday 
All your might just burns away 
All your hate becomes a tool 
Blame yourself for what i do 
Use of me use of me use of everything 
Left again left again like a tired stain 
Listen good listen good so it's understood 
Cant forgive can't forgive all the things you did 
I am your everyday everything 
Its in your face as your sentences swim 
I see the demons underneath your skin 
I see the teeth in the cracking of your smile 
I see the black of your eyes in denial 
I see the same thing again and again 
I see the aftermath of letting you in 
I see your evil come without a restraint 
I see the nightmares of being awake 
You try and beat me down every fucking day 
Ive found the way to erase the building pain 
I come to get you with revenge on my breath 
I come to get you with the lesson of death 
I come to get you with the scars and the blood 
I come to get you with the intention of god

Low 
A thousand times ive heard them say 
What good is this to us anyway 
A thousand times i live this day 
I listen to words as they float away 
And that's what this is all about 
A little bit of emptiness put out 
A little bit of tragedy, 
To make it seem deeper than it should be 
Im so low 
Even when i see the way is up 
Im so low 
Even when i lose myself 
Im so low 
Everything is pushing me back down and i know 
Im so low 
A thousand prayers ive had to speak 
A little bit of help to ease the weak 
A thousand steps i never learn 
I end up falling with every turn 
And that's what this is all about

A little bit of tragedy

God is now here
God is nowhere (6x)
I lost my way in the daylight
I flew out with no wings
So find guidance on Sunday
I found mine with the weak
I should be looking for miricles
But all I'm finding out is pain
I should be searching for miricles
But now I'm dying in vain
I've been chosen a healer
Standing faith from the saint
I've been down with the meager
'Cause they can't be explained away
I should be looking for miricles
But all I'm finding out is pain
I should be searching for miricles
But now I'm dying in vain

Shameface 
I will watch you go down with your plastic face laughing all the way 
I will watch you fall down with your plastic heart laughing it all out 
Nothing colder then an old friend betrayal has it's in 
Like with such a trip and a little trick who wouldn't do what you do 
You're not gonna save me 
There's so much I've left here lately 
So unfortunately 
Luck has surely kicked me 
Your nitrous secret seems all this treatment got burnt up in the threes it's nothing to take it apart when you build it at a higher 
Rate than one could ever debate and when we're in the mood for a twisting tale the kind of curves that makes the man's ruin hurt I'm on 
The bottom but I'm looking up just as a broken worth becomes a shattered rut and like a little kill just here and there no one will 
Notice if they're not aware I can tell it's nothing for you to let it all go when your guilt is obsession at the next highest level and 
In your final release there is nothing that sweet the kind that makes the ruin of man repeat now go become your place hide within the 
Walls of yourself this is shameface 
You're not really with me 
There's so much I've been through lately 
So unfortunately 
Luck has surely kicked me you're not gonna save me

The ride takes me so high 
I'm never coming down 
I saw the flood of angels 
Amend the shredded shroud 
Addiction bomb 
Takes over inside 
Twisting my mind 
Looks like I'm falling 
Out of focus 
Wanting pith 
Higher locus 
Bowers of bliss 
This skin 
Burn-out shows he's devoid of control 
Found fettled up into your null 
Out of focus 
Wanting pith 
Higher locus 
Bowers of bliss 
This skin

Slow Wreck 
A break in the system 
A tragedy i'm afraid has struck 
Me not quite unlike a burning kiss 
This death would wreck me 
And she dove in glass biting skin 
While blood cell metal welt blistered sin 
Not quite unlike a twisting shift 
This wreck would get me 
In an eternity just like a dream 
I'm afraid to see not quite unlike 
Deserving fools on a plane of shame 
Hit infinity like a scrap disease 
Forgotten spark wished fuel to bleed 
All pouring out some things we lack 
I'm going back through a slow wreck 
A null line paints the rhythm 
A weary dream i expect to see 
Not too unlike just how you hate me 
So downward thinking this death degrades me 
Into a cloud black motor shroud 
Some sick and proud space in the ground 
Although she sleeps with cells that creep 
I'm on these knees prayers that she keeps down 
Slow wreck does seethe 
Gains more with speed 
Blown all away more than the last time

Something Left 
I can't release you after all the things I put in you 
My pointed edges seem to be always peeking through 
This dead red skin feels nothing like what I make you see 
I gotta hold out something, I gotta hold out something left for me 
Something left 
Something left 
Something left 
Something left 
My angels wings are clipped to keep from getting too high 
I cough up hell and watch it swarm around inside 
It's what I'm about, my favorite inside source is defeat 
I'm on the losing side, I'm on the losing side of the bottom sheet 
Something left 
Something left 
Something left

Is there something left 
There's nothing left

Stitched 
Parasite comes on again 
Given out with nothing left 
Forgiven hurt blood in the veins 
Broken wing the one who waits 
Like an open wound 
I'm in need 
Like forever sewn 
I just can't bleed 
Get with you 
I need more suffering 
Splint for two 
Born to choke up everything 
Shed this hell 
I would give you anything 
Sworn to tell 
I am now the host of hate

Hey you, follow with a force-fed plastic hype. 
Hey you, shallow like the rest of your empty life. 
Hey you, claiming that you're real from back in the day. 
Hey you, everybody knows that you're really just fake. 
Set it off right with a bright light coming through. 
Set it off right with a fist-fight attitude. 
Set it off right with a hate you dicipline. 
Set it off right when we get the truth back again. 
Sinking in the silence, 
Living my life through, 
Running from the inside, 
Suffering you.

The Cut Collector 
Bored out hollow 
This one's the keeper of sorrow 
And one wish with a bullet of lead 
Could end it all with a shot to the head (but she won't) 
Held out, reload, the automatic repro 
And what proof with the threat of death 
She tried to die just by holding her breath 
It all comes out 
She cuts herself to release it 
What a horrible spell 
Its just release 
She's the cut collector 
Worn out shallow 
Design the scars of your self-help 
And one night with the promise of life 
She stole time with the edge of a knife (but she won't) 
It all comes out 
She cuts herself to release it 
What a horrible spell 
Its just release 
She's the cut collector

The Dreams That Rot In Your Heart 
Wrapped in transparent dreams 
The way to the end is the means 
Now you're caught in this web of things you shouldn't have said 
And now it's totally true 
No one is gonna save you 
It's kinda sad how you just sit there trying to find words to say 
I see everything 
And now you're slipping away 
And no one cares what you say 
You're a slave to yourself 
I'm glad you know it so well 
I've got this beautiful view 
Looking right down on you 
It's kinda sad how you just sit there trying to find your own truth 
I see everything 
And I'm thinking of way 
To blow it apart 
Just like all of the dreams 
That rot in your heart 
This shell turns to night 
It shelters the light 
And if fate is so drawn, you'll be left alone without anyone 
Just seeing without anyone 
And if you think I am wrong 
I could take you to a place inside my head where images are gray and red 
I see everything

I've got your picture
Of me and you
You wrote "I love you"
I love you too
I sit there staring and there's nothing else to do
Oh it's in color
Your hair is brown
Your eyes are hazel
And soft as clouds
I often kiss you when there's no one else around
I think I'm turning Japanese
I think I'm turning Japanese
I'm turning Japanese
I really think so
I've got your picture, I've got your picture
I'd like a million of them all over my cell
I want the doctor to take your picture
So I can look at you from inside as well
You've got me turning up and turning down
And turning in and turning 'round
You've got me turning up and turning down
And turning in and turning 'round

No sex, no drugs, no wine, no women
No fun, no sin, no you, no wonder it's dark
Everyone around me is a total stranger
Everyone avoids me like a psyched lone ranger
Everyone
That's why I'm turning Japanese
I think I'm turning Japanese

Call me in the morning just before the breakfast show
We'll watch TV and analyze the weather
Before we go to work, we'll have planned the day ahead
We'll while away the working day together

Work all day or work all night, it's all the same

Some are workers, some are not

There's a party going on that's going
To change the way we live
But how do we know we've even been invited
Now the invitation's waiting, and the table is reserved
So just play it cool and don't get excited
Work all day or work all night, it's all the same

Will we ever change
It's vocation or vacation
Some are workers, some are not
It is time for a party
Syncopation for the nation now
Crushed by the wheels of industry

Breaking in the future just before the week is up
They can do it, but it's going to take some money
Have what you desire if and when you see the fact
They will lead us to the land of milk and honey
Work all day or work all night, it's all the same
If you want the pay
(But do you really want the pain)
Some drive tankers, some are bankers
Some are workers, some are not
It is time for a party
Liberation for the nation now

Sweat my youth away
With the rules we have to play
Speeding through your magazine
Pistol, pavement, no T.V.

No time (nighttime)
Burnt inside, burnt inside, burnt inside
Here comes the daylight, here comes my job
Uptown in the penthouse or downtown with the mob
Here comes the nighttime, here comes my role
Goodbye to the pavement, hello to my soul
Now here comes my job
Credit bleeding with the mob
Dreams become ideals
No one knows the way I feel

Daytime (right time)
All my life, all my life, all my life
Here comes the daylight, here comes my job
Uptown in the penthouse or downtown with the mob
Here comes the nighttime, here comes my role
Goodbye to the pavement, hello to my soul
Goodbye to the pavement, hello to my soul
As you face the wall
God make it this time or never at all
Before your chance has gone
Captain this lead role, and you'll be the one

This time (my time)
Make me free at last
Make me free at last
Make me free at last
Here comes the daylight, here comes my job
Uptown in the penthouse or downtown with the mob
Here comes the nighttime, here comes my role
Goodbye to the pavement, hello to my soul

You don't seem to care about this love that we have
I called you last night but you were not there
I didn't hear from you at all today

I'm just wasting my time
You leave me with no other choice
But to say goodbye
I want to work things out
But what's the point of it if
I have to be in love alone
It's not worth it anymore
It's hard for me to say goodbye
But tears are falling down from my eyes
I'm sorry, Im sorry but we tried
I thought we shared a life that's full of love
But now I realize we shared an empty home
I will cry my last cry before I say bye, bye
I will sing my last love song for you tonight

And one named Ryan too
They all think they are cool
And they wear lots of Fubu
They've got the baggiest jeans
And they never change their clothes
They strut around like a black man would
And their women are slutty ho's!!
Never going to get a job
They will never have any hope
Uneducated, Unliterated
They smoke too much dope!!
They're all skids!!!
Now Jimmy's Grown up
He has a wife and kids
They are just like him
Big fuckin' SKIDS!!!
He's havin' some major problems now,
I feel sorry for his wife
She's got cuts and bruises
From good old Jimmy's Knife!
35 Years old 
Doesn't have a job 
I kinda feel sorry for him
He's such a dirty slob!
He's Jimmy!

No One Can See Your Face 
How does it feel?
To know that you won today.
I wouldn't know,
I haven't played your head games.
The time has come,
To quit being someone else.
And open your eyes,
To see you can be yourself.
I don't ask much
All I want is a little respect
From you
But you can't see
Where I'm comin from here
I don't expect you to
But all I need,
Is a little attention to
Get out of here
Chorus....
You don't know what it's like to be,
In my place,
I wanna get out of here,
But your in my way
Now you know what it's like to be,
In last place
You want to stay inside,
So no one can see your face.
Another day gone,
I have to see you again today at school,
But that's okay,
Cause I know your too cool,
To talk to me,
I think I'll just stay away.
Before you tell me to,
Get out of here
Chorus........

Nothin' Much 
I've heard all that you've been saying
It wasn't very nice
I don't think I deserve
To be called the names that I've been called
I didn't want to do it
This is not my fault
I've been here before
And I don't like the things you said
And I guess I don't have a chance 
Of gettin' back with you
But I don't think I really want to now
You did those things you wanted to.
I don't care if you hate me now
Because you know I don't like you
That is just the childish thing to do
And I don't care what they've been saying
You know that it's not true
All I want is one more chance
To prove myself to you
I don't really care now
If you don't think I'm cool
All I need is one more chat
To show you that you I rule
Chorus....
And I don't really care what I have to do now
Just as long as it doesn't incorporate you
And I don't really care what I have to do now
As long as I get through

Her name is Becky
And she's got spikey hair
She locked herself out from the world
Cause she doesn't care
Chorus....
She's got spikey Hair (4x)
She's anti-society
Anti-everything
She's so hardcore
She looks like Sting

And big long leather boots
She worships the Sex Pistols
She thinks Sid Vicious is cute

Second Guess 
Sitting around in my room today.
I don't think that I'm going to stay.
I'm thinking about moving out pretty soon.
I wanna be gone just before noon.
My parents are yelling 
They don't understand me
They think that I'm some sort of freak
I try to explain that 
It's not all my fault
But I just end up losing more sleep.
Chorus....
Now don't you go blaming this whole mess on me,
Cause you are to blame none the less.
But if you leave here crying, unhappy, and faceless
Then you just failed one of life's tests.
My mind isn't settled 
I Still can't think clearly
And i know that i'm needing you less.
If you still think i'm worthless
And i'm not worth keeping 
There is no use for a second guess.

Selfish 
Think,  About the years that are coming
About the times when I won't 
Have to say to myself
That I'm a waste of bones
I'm still afraid, Of what I haven't been through yet
And I'm not quite prepared
For things that I've never met
And I'm still in content
You don't know
What I've been looking for
And you'll never find out
Because I'm too Selfish!!!
Look!! There is still plenty of time
To get things straihgtened out
And put ourselves back on our feet
To make things nice and smooth

Stolen Car 
I went to a party on Saturday Night
I stole a car and I was looking to fight
I know that you were looking for me
But I was too scared to let myself free
I stole a car and I am the coolest kid at tonights party
But when I bring the car back no one will even know who I am anymore
Later on,  I brought the car back home
I walked the streets by myself the whole way home
I passed some girls,  I didn't know who they were
I couldn't find out cause I didn't have my car

There is no way for you
To make this one up to me
I have given you many hints
And still you cannot see
That you are dull
And you are blind
Who really cares if I can't tell time?
I sure don't 
neither should you
That's just one thing I can't do.
I guess I'm just dumb!
So how about a movie
On Wednesday afternoon
I'll be there early cause 
I want to see you soon
But I know
That you don't care
As long as you have 
Time to do your hair
It's 12 o'clock
I'm still alone
Why won't you pick up the phone?
I'm too tired
To wait Anymore
Listen for  a knock at your front door

Get up,  Stand up,
Walk out on those idiots
They don't like you anymore
You've been,  Here for
Several Weeks and yet still they
Hate you anyway
What is left to say? 
Turn over a brand new leaf,
And walk out on them . 
It doesnt matter anymore . 
If you want to be you 
Then stand up for yourself and 
Let them be!!!
This is,  not what you want
But I guess, you have no choice
Listen, you're too good for them
Just pack all your bags and leave
Get up,  Stand up
Walk out on those idiots

Hate you anyway

Is this what they've been telling you to tell all of your friends tonight
That I'm a jerk and I only like your body not your mind.
Don't listen,  They are wrong,  It is not that way at all
I am going to take you out tonite at 9
And it is not going to affect anything at all
And I know you have been wondering why I haven't decided to call
You won't pick up the phone because you haven't talked to me all day
But I am sure that you will get over it.
And I know,  That its time,  to get ourselves back home.
And you Have been wonderin where we have been for these past three months.
And I know,  that its time,  to put an end to this legal crime
Call me tomorrow and I'll figure out how long it is until you start to cry

Valley Girl 
She claims she's pregnant
She said this for some time
But she knows that she's full of shit
And dirty skankin' lies
Now that her glory
Is gone!
She doesn't get the credit that
She did have for so long
She doesn't want to get involved with
Boys and girls that don't understand 
That pregnancy's a pain in the ass
All she wants is freedom now
To LEAVE!

She's full of lies
She claims she's pregnant

I thought you should know that I can't take this life away,
I can't get a hold on you.
But then you should know that I'll always be scared to go there with you.
I thought you should know...
Feel it like I would,
Forget about the whole world.
It's only right if you can stay here with me.
I thought you should know that I'll always be scared of why you left the way you did.
I thought you should know...
Stay here like I would,
Forget about the whole world.
It's only right if you can stay
Here with me.
You could have chosen less and I accept that I'll never know your choice, your life or what it feels like.
Taking over...
Tell me of the choice, your life and what if feels like.
Running over me completely.
Now the knife's in me it's over.
The will has gone and I can't breathe.
There's only time to take one breath,
And I don't even want what's left.
You have chosen this is it.
It's over.
Hold on said I.
It's like seeing you but I feel no love inside.
Take a hold, don't you ever let go.

You wonder why I spend so much time flying high.
The world below has nothing new to inspire you.
I get over her then you cut me in two.
It only gets worse, as you descend to the earth.
I've nothing left to lift me high but Firefly.
And now that I find, here I am ??
Next in line for a piece of the world I can't hold - just watch it fold.
If there's nothing more then I can't be sure I can go on much longer.
But if there is higher ground to be found,
Why can't you just me there now, save time?
Coz I'm so sick of this.
Every day is so hit and miss in this life.
Pass the fire down.
You can't decide your life is fine by flying high.
Can't you look past the world that's been put in front of you?
See it ending?
Rise with me.
But it only gets worse, as you descend back to earth.
Pass the fire down.
Pass the burn.
You never felt the fire you just cried yourself to sleep.
What means more?
To die or never have lived before.
When you see your
Life pass by did you ever soar?

You don't wanna know what I'm thinking.

Tooth and nail grind to dust, she said.
Back down coz there's nowhere else to go.
I'm never wrong when I'm looking through this red shroud you pulled down over my eyes.
Say you're wrong.
Take back all that you've said and done.
Why can't you stop?
She told me, don't ever hurt yourself like i want to.
What it is to see you.
What it is to feel you coming on - so beautiful.
I never want to hurt you.
Back down coz I feel the pressure on
Back down coz I can't let go.
You are a fire inside me.
Back down.
Don't walk away.
Take this one from me to you
As you looked up at me,
What was it you said again?
Tooth and nail grinds down ??
Not on your forgiving skin.
Why'd you take me there again?
- The brink of ruining everything.
Still you hold, unyielding.

It's her, Just her.
Too often now I look at you and I see just a shadow of what you used to be.
(I'm) Struggling now to see something in you that I can respect,
coz you're so hollow, just a shadow.
I'm thinking months ago,
It burned inside of you ??
A need to have someone to control you,
To take everything you are and mould you into somebody else
It's all about her.
It's all about everything she wants from you ??
Not the real you.
You walk on all fours and bow down to her without a care for the real you.
Shut up and break it.
You hate it but can't live without it.
You need it to feed on you, suck the life out of you.
Why are you so scared to stand up and take on the fight?
She's a parasite...
She'll devour you...
It's all about her.
It's all about everything she wants from you ?? 
Not the real you.
You walk on all fours and bow down to her without a care for what you are.
You're just something for her to mould into something new.
Where's the real you?

Are You Happy 
Hip hip hooray
You got what you wanted
A year and a day and my memory's still haunted by you
And it's such a shame you don't feel the same way
Everybody knows you go where the wind blows
Put a hole in my heart you could walk right through
Do what you gotta do
I don't sleep until the party is over
And then I spend my day in bed
But I can't shake this question from my head
Yeah I gotta know!
Are you happy? 
Are you happy? Yeah I gotta know! 
Are you happy now, now, now?
Are you happy now?
Hip hip hooray
Now I see it clearly
Anyone's a fool who would take words sincerely from you
I try to smile, and you try to fake it
Now every word you said is stuck in my head
And I can't take it anymore
And you walk out the door
Now I don't sleep until the party's over
And then I spend my day in bed
But I can't shake this question from my head
Yeah I gotta know!
Are you happy? 
Are you happy? Yeah I gotta know! 
Are you happy now, now, now? Yeah I gotta know! 
Are you happy? Yeah I gotta know! 
Are you happy? Yeah I gotta know! 
Are you happy now, now, now, now?
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
It's not about what's right or wrong
C'mon I'm trying to make you see
You can to talk to me
C'mom, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I don't care what side you're on
I turn around and you were gone
Why did you have to go?
Yeah I gotta know!
Are you happy now, now, now?
I hope to God you're happy!
Are you happy? 
Are you happy?
Yeah I gotta know!
Are you happy now, now, now, now?
Yeah I gotta know that it's done
Know that you're gone
I'll take the blame for what went wrong
Forget the tears, forget the fights
Well I can't take these sleepless nights
But there's one thing you should know
I hope you're happy now

Broken 
I don't need to call the FBI
I don't have to call the CIA
My friends all saw you with another guy
Now you're standing here with nothing to say
Once again you're on some shaky ground
With all the sorry friends you hang around
It seems the higher that I build you up
The more you bring me down
Well I'm through
I'm done with you
Before my heart is broken
Broken guitar
It's got broken strings
It's always the same shit
Always the same thing
First she loves me
Then she leaves
It's always the same shit
Always the same old thing
And I'm glad your ass is leaving baby
I really am - and here's another thing
Don't go waiting for your phone to ring
And don't go thinking that I miss you
When you listen to me sing
About a girl
Who's all alone
And her heart is broken
You didn't have to sneak behind my back
*oooh*
And your apologies they don't mean jack
*oooh*
So I think you'd better take your sorry ass and move it on down the line
Before there's time
To change my mind
Before your heart is broken
Broken guitar
It's got broken strings
It's always the same shit
Always the same thing
You say you love me
And then you leave
It's always the same shit
Always the same old thing
One girl drops by as another girl leaves
And it's always the same shit
Always the same old thing
It's always the same old thing

Happens All Over The World 
I brought you flowers, I tried to treat you nice
Like pink champagne, you left me bottled up on ice
I'll never be famous or make a hundred grand
I'll never be a superhero but I could be your man
I would love to make you feel all right
But you keep me going all through the night
New York to LA
Motor City every day
Even down in FLA
All across the U.S.A.
It happens all over the world
Your doctor and your school teacher
Housewife and soul preacher
Got to do the twist and twirl
Every boy and every girl
It happens all over the world
I sent you letters and sealed them with a kiss
Nothing new to say, it's just a workout for my lips
You never answer
You just pretend that you're not home
I'll never be your superhero if you don't pick up the phone
I would love to take you for a ride
But you keep me going in overdrive
New York to LA
Motor City every day
Even down in FLA

Rabies 
Baby sits down in my favorite chair
I sit on the ground and play with her hair
Who knows what I'd be without her
I never want to find out
Walking her dog on the 4th of July
Waxing her car and flying a kite
She's my everything
My everything
Bit by bit I'm gone
Ive been bit by puppy love
Mothin is foaming my baby gave me, Baby gave me
Rabies that hit like bricks
Save me I think I'm sick
Shoot me I think I'm starting to care
Looking around for the rest of my life
The part with my friends and the rest of the guys
Got to the ring and I started to swing
Who knew what I was fighting for
She called me by name and said would you please
Put down the gloves and drop to your knees
Be my everything
My everything
Bit by bit I'm gone
Ive been bit by puppy love
Mothin is foaming my baby gave me, Baby gave me
Rabies that hit like bricks
Save me I think I'm sick
Shoot me I think I'm starting to care
Rabies I need a shot
To save me from what I've caught 
Shoot me I think I'm starting to care
So if she asks for me I'm gone
Tell her I said she can carry on
And that she has to let me go
That is all she needs to know
Bit by bit Im gone
Ive been bit by puppy love
Mothin is foaming my baby gave me, Baby gave me
Rabies that hit like bricks
Save me I think I'm sick
Shoot me I think I'm starting to care
Rabies I need a shot

So Cool 
Got our first gig at the local bar
And it wasn't paying
Hauled in beat up amps and cheap guitars
Plugged 'em in and started playing

We got tattoos and a rental van
With my girlfriend's money
Now she wants it back 'cause she hates the band
We think that's funny
You think I'm so cool
You think I'm so cool
We're in it for money
Guitars and tattoos
You fell for it honey
Oh yeah
Don't you think that's cool?
You bought my CD and a video
With your daddy's money
Now you can't afford to make the show
Don't you find that funny?

Tv Queen 
In a town that's all tinsel and teeth
It's getting hard to compete
You don't need brains or glasses
To see it in their face
Or feel it in their asses
She checks her face on the Sunset Strip
Lights a cigarette, exhales the hit
And now a word from our sponsor
Every once in a while do you have trouble getting it up
Up from the couch and the show she's been watching
Where her eyes do the listening
Her box does the talking
You have no idea I'm even alive
*TV Queen*
And if I couldn't ever see you again you'd say "well that's fine"
*TV Queen*
But you fail to see what you've done to me
And how you've come to be my TV, my TV Queen
My TV Queen
My TV Queen
Yeah
Mr. Johnson, I've got really bad news
Your girlfriend's an alien, twelve months due
Due to the smog in California
Every once in a while I have trouble getting it up
Up to the level that I know I'm missing
My eyes can't see the lips I'm kissing
You have no idea I'm even alive

And if I couldn't ever see you again you'd say "well that's fine"

A Conversation 
People and their ways, filling up their days
but then what am I doing?
sharing the same days, looking for new ways
but then what are they doing?
lost underneath what I think I should be
I bet you feel the same weight 
or maybe not
all I can do is make a guess after all
so I guess the right answer 
and fit the peg into the right slot for me
and I guess you're unfulfilled and frustrated with your TV
looking deeper into the screen
seeing only shallow reflections of your life going by
looking back at you
and I guess you're telling yourself about a great tomorrow
pushing off what you want
until you can just get X, Y, and Z out of the way
the sun will rise just the same tomrorow
but will you?
time takes its toll
and i guess you say its not that bad
the day is over, home awaits anxiously
sitting right next to home friday finds itself on your door step again
has it already been a week?
hold your breath some more, keep waiting
i've giving up on trying to understand
i guess you're not that different from me
but we're worlds apart

Can't Change Everything 
Just because i can't change everything,
doesn't mean i can't change anything. 
Dance on the ashes of what was and fall head first in what could be. 
Beyond the barricade...is there a world you long to see? 
To envision a world without chains but recognize that we, 
as individuals, can only chip away at the links. 
One at a time, day by day. 
To have the ability to wage quiet wars in our everyday lives, 
and recognize the subtle victories when they happen....
An opinion changed by something you said. 
A lifestyle adjusted by what you suggested. 
A brighter path taken with directions you gave. 
A world revealed by what you did. 
One brick today is one less for tomorrow.

Control 
Control what comes in to control what comes out. 
Absorbing their versions of what life's about. 
Spoon fed the world through a filter that caters to money,
and fills us with doubt....
and there's so much more to see than the world through TV. 
Numb from the boredom you can't feel the whip across your back. 
Always look through the same window of course you'll have the same view. 
It's lights, camera, action, take us and tell us what to do. 
What to see what to think what to wear what to do with our lives. 
Millions of channels to fashion reigns out of our eyes. 
To walk back and forth in a box and bind myself with golden chains (is not freedom).

Fall 
Your heart filled with hate vacuums the smile off my face. 
It makes a bad day pass slower 
--your backward ideas-- 
stumbling and falling instead of reaching... 
I don't want to. 
I dont want to look at the stars with you 
until you can look at strangers with me 
(and smile instead of smirk) a sneer across your face, 
everything is ugly to you 
and beauty can't exist in anything, in anyone at all...) 
are not here 
your body is a shadow a memory of what used to be 
we can say hello but you're dead to me. 
I don't want to look at the stars with you 
until you can look at strangers with me and smile.

For Sale 
Don't admire the colors today, let it be black and white for a while. 
Put off your dreams for another day, you're too busy to hope right now. 
Prices falling, standards gone--your price has fallen, you're life's been bought. 
You don't need to enjoy this moment when there's vacation to hope for. 
You don't live life for excitement, you just live to get by. 
Sell your life for nothing in return, 
there's no money you can earn to rebuild bridges that you've burned. 
You can own it, you can own it all. 
Possess everything but yourself. 
Send away for tomorrow, then open your mail that's never there. 
A life that breaks more than it builds, and leaves you bored and unfulfilled. 
A life that takes more than it gives. 
A life that i don't want to live. 
A life that thinks it knows it all, as it drives itself into a wall. 
You can't sustain/maintain this life...

Go 
Where'd you go? 
Everyone's got everywhere to go, but no time to show they really care. 
Keeping track of time, all the time...underneath that schedule nothing's there.
Unfulfilling days winding through a maze, looking back to see that no one's there. 
Losing track of time. 
Each breath interrupted by schedules..electronic screams to move you on. 
Moments lost to the schedules. 
Moments lost to the rush. 
Wasted time is a crime and i'm guilty. 
Moments filtered through the hourglass. 
Don't go.

Quote 
Said he doesn't remember anything about a wall, 
"There's nothing there," he told me. "Nothing at all." 
Said she only remembers pictures on the floor. 
"There's nothing there," she told me. "At least not anymore." 
And now the air is thick with lies and broken trust, 
"but i don't mind," he told me, under blankets of dust. 
Familiar faces read like a tombstone for a grave, 
"but that's okay," they told me. "There's nothing to save." 
And things are changing for the worse a little more each day. 
Say the same things. Say them over and over. 
Say the same things. Say them over and over. 
And now every bridge is gone. There's only ruins where they belong. 
And still everything feels wrong as i turn the page.

Throw 
Throw your uniform away now and burn the flag above your head. 
Toss your medals to the wind now before you're victoriously dead. 
Turn your tanks around. Use the metal to build a playground.

Made to kill, launched at will, bombs fall.

Voice 
A voice is heard. 
The sound draws you to yourself above the clatter of a world so cold. 
From every direction, every other voice, 
we're told what to think and what to believe. 
Why do you leave my mind alone? 
I can see what you're doing, no i'm not that naive. 
Don't abuse my mind just 'cause you've ruined your own. 
I wont let emptiness fill my heart. 
A scream, a voice has strength that shatters lies. 
A truth so simple, so often overlooked. 
And when it is we way how we feel, 
it is our voice that gives us strength that fills our hearts. 
Listen to your voice.

You're Wrong 
Open your eyes. 
You're not blind. 
I know you wont like what you find. 
See the looks on their faces. 
See the looks in their eyes. 
Don't know the truth. 
Don't look for proof. 
Now we've got our war, 
to sacrifice for. 
And you don't give a shit, 
just consume and submit. 
Believe all you're told, 
you're minds are controlled. 
It's "our way of life," 
overflowing with strife. 
Regurgitate lies, 
WITH BLOOD IN YOUR EYES. 
YOU'RE WRONG.

You won a prize for that, for telling lies like that so
well that I believed it. 
I never felt cheated. 
You were the chosen one, the pure eyes of Noah's

Choir boys and angles stole your lips and your halo. 
In your reckless mind, you act as if you've got more

In your reckless eyes, you only have time and your
love of danger--to it your no stranger. 
In that August breeze of those forgotten trees, your

In your reckless eyes, it's never too late for a

Very, so very wise.

And there'll be flowers baby, for you and me  
 just wait and see, and everyone is gonna come  
 and there be sunshine baby, in every room

 When we get married (When we get married)  
 When we get married (When we get married) When we get married  
 And there'll be church bells ringing everywhere  
 and this I swear it's gonna be for you and me  
 and in the chapel baby you wear my ring

 when we are standing side by side  
 and when your daddy gives his little girl away  
 your mamma gonna break right down and cry

Compulsory Hero 
Remember the times when we were kids
Playing war games in your yard
Everybody had to be a hero
and get one in the heart
Night would fall and we'd call a truce
And all go home
Years went by we were average guys
playing life by the rule of thumb
Till a man came on the TV
Talking 'bout war like he wanted one
He said "Everybody put your backs to the wall
till your numbers called"
You've gotta go and be a hero
I've got a new game for all you boys
Its war without a choice
Compulsory hero
Just try and make it home
Grandpa heard the call to all
For a war to end all wars
And your dad went off to do his bit
and he had to go one more
You've really got no say in it
You have to fight 
And thats the law
You've gotta go and be a hero
They made a law you had to go fight
One more crazy war 
Compulsory hero
Just try and make it home
So all that had to be heroes 
Went off to do their chores
None of them really wouldn't of known 
How far a bloody war goes
they're dying to make it home
Then I think back on all those times
Playing war games in your yard
Everybody had to be a hero
Back then that wasn't hard
Night would fall on the battle zone
And we could all go home
You had to go and be a hero
They made a law that you had to go and fight
One more crazy war
compulsory hero
Just try and make it home 
Just try and make it home
But whose gonna make it home

If I Could 
If I could paint
I'd paint a portrait of you
The sunlight in your eyes a masterpiece of truth
And a single tear like a silent prayer
That's shining so much brighter than a diamond ever dared
If I could do anything at all, I'd do it for you
If I could write
I'd write a book for you
A tale of hidden treasures with an I.O.U
And a million words wouldn't say a thing
That won't be said in three words
Where love's the central theme
If I could do anything at all, I'd do it for you
Chorus
Darling can't you see
What you mean to me
Anything that I can do I'll do it for you
And darling don't you know
Just how far I'd go
Anything that I can do, I'd do it for you
Sometimes I feel so second-rate
Seems loving you was my greatest mistake
I know I'm insecure
And love don't keep score
But I wish I could give you more
If I could play
I'd play up a storm for you
A raging sea of passion that you never knew
Every whispered sound would touch your heart
And maybe for a moment I could be your favourite star
If I could do anything at all
If I could, I'd give you more
If I could do anything at all..I'd do it for you
Chorus
And darling can't you see
You mean the world to me
Anything that I can do I'll do it for you
And darling don't you know
Just how far I'd go
Anything that I can do I'll do it, I'll do it for you
I'll do it, do it for you

That's When I Think Of You 
When I'm lost in a strange place
Scared and alone
When I'm wishing for home
That's when I think of you
When the load gets to heavy
Too much to bear
When I'm going nowhere
There's no one there
And I'm feeling like a fool
Chorus
That's when i think of you 
It's all that I can do
I'd go mad if it wasn't for you
When I'm caught in the crossfire 
Of wrongs making right
When I wake in the night
That's when i think of you
When I'm halfway to heaven
With three parts of hell
And its all just as well
That I can't even tell 
And I'm lost without a clue
Chorus
If not for the thought of you
The promise of dreams come true
I'd go mad if it wasn't for you
When I'm a long way from loving
So far from home
When it feels like I'm in the twilight zone
And I just cant make it thru
Chorus
If not for the thought of you
The promise of dreams come true
I'd go mad if it wasn't for you
I'm always thinking of you 
It's all that I can do
I'd go mad not being with you
If not for the thought of
Promise of dreams come true
I'd go mad not being with you

You'll Never Know 
Thinking about you oh so much,
Im losing peace of mind
Scared there'd be a treasure lost all of the time
Whispering voices deep inside,
Crying to be heard
Telling me to take the risk of love until it hurts
And baby
CHORUS
You'll never know 
Know which choice to make
Take or break a hold
Which way to go
Say what you will
What your willing to give
Give or take control 
Will we ever know
Standing on a corner 
Like a victim of a crime
You nearly passed me by
Then you said you'd had your share of lies 
And make believe
Now all you want from me is some kind of guarantee
Chorus
You'll never know for sure
You spend all your life keeping score
Still never know

Save A Place 
When the cloud over your mind
Finally breaks and rains to remind
You of me covering you
That's when the light comes crashing through
So I'll keep away and save a place for you
And I'll only make the same mistakes as you
When you stop hitting the wall
It's not the plaster that ruined this hall
When all the blood all over your fingers is dried up
The pain will still linger
So I'll keep away and save a place for you
And I'll only make the same mistakes as you
Scream until you smile
But I'm the only one who hears
When you wake up to the sound
Of a thousand voices around
Can you hear the rattle of words
That only takes a heart to be heard

And you'll break your heart almost every time.

You get back up.

Enough Is Enough 
Tear the roof off my life
And gut out my insides
Hold me closer, hold me closer
Tear the roof off my life
And gut out my insides
Hold me closer, hold me closer
In your arms
It's alright
I should have let you know
In your eyes
I still fall
I shouldn't have let you go
I can't believe that someone's taken my place
You'll see me burning bright as I walk away
Doesn't matter it's only a matter of time
Understand at the very least I tried
To find the cure for my own infatuous words
Still singing I'll never let you go from my heart
Like you were the only one
In your arms
It's alright
I should have let you know
In your eyes
I still fall
I shouldn't have let you go
I kiss the bottle now that it's my only love
I am the smile I am the thing that you needed for a while
Doesn't matter it's only a matter of time
Understand that at the very least I tried
To find the cure for my own infatuous words
Still singing I'll never let you go from my heart
Like you were the only one
In your arms
It's alright
I should have let you know
In your eyes
I still fall
Forgive me baby
Forgive away
For taking up your time and forsaking everything
Find me gone someday it's closer than you know
So what's to frame in light goodbye at dawn, so long goodnight
My time is wasted feeling chased
I'm running far away to you again
In your arms
It's alright
I should have let you know
In your eyes
I still fall

Grace 
Tell me,
Tell me why,
The snow is white,
But I can't wash it all away. (away)
You left last spring.
You went to find something.
You could see,
But could never speak.
West wings will wash you away.
Love will lift you off the ground,
Don't be afraid.
Grace will fly you home again.
My hearts crying for a change,
For the road to bend,
To be home again.
And grace is where I end and you begin.
My love, my friend.
To be your light,
My eyes have seen no light.
The sunset was the last thing on my mind.
I feel your hands,
You shake my face,
And tell me,
It's okay to believe.
West wings will wash you away.
Love will lift you off the ground,
Don't be afraid.
Grace will fly you home again.
My hearts crying for a change,
For the road to bend,
To be home again.
And grace is where I end and you begin.
My love, my friend.
Grace is all around you.
The sky is white.
I'm ready to be better.
You're all around me.
Yea
All around me.
Yea, yea, yea
Grace will fly you home again.
Where your standing in the doorway,
Singing songs to my old poetry.
Grace will fly you home again.
My hearts crying for a change,
For the road to bend,
To be home again.
And grace is where I end and begin

In Your Car 
Does she kiss you like i did?
And do your hearts beat in unison?
The chords are ringing out,
My fingertips are pouring rain upon the rooftop
Because inside this house
There's nothing left, nothing left to say
This won't break me
Because i'm not the drugs
I am not the pain you feel inside
When you're lying there awake
It's just the absence of blood in your veins
Drown the pain of this one to the sound of my guitar
This song becomes our anthem as we sing it in your car
I'm an itch beneath your skin
That alcohol that you have been drowning in
Well, it aches for a century
The one who wastes your year
The fool that you call love
Drown the pain of this one to the sound of my guitar
This song becomes our anthem as we sing it in your car
The radio's on tonight
So sing it if you're still alive
You're still alive
You bare it all (x2)
Drown the pain of this one to the sound of my guitar
This song becomes our anthem as we sing it in your car (x2)

I said, "You look like poetry, baby"
I am quite low
And far too high
Every time we fight, they know

You are not the man you were before
(Couldn't take it with the questions I have now)

This crown is not holy

Tennessee Song 
There's a sadness in the air
On the train to Tennessee
And I know there's no angel watching over me
All I have to hold
Is this atlas and a note that reads
If ever you are ready to come home again
I'll be waiting up
But please don't be too long
You know I never meant to make you lonesome
But I got my own plans
And if you love me, understand
I've got to take this road to find out who I really am
So tonight, I'll take the long way home
And drink until I can't remember you
Or why I ever started
If I can't hold you
Gonna fold you like a note and keep you here
With me
Thought about your smile
On the car ride up to Madison
Are you still letting go?
Are you still letting go?
Cause I've been trying to move on
But I'm feeling so damn lost
Without your love
Without your love
Tonight, I'll take the long way home
And drink until I can't remember you
Or why I ever started
If I can't hold you
Gonna fold you like a note and keep you here
With me
I want you here
With me
Tonight I'll take the long way home
Won't you drink with me until the sun comes up?
Look at what we started
If I can't hold you
I'm gonna fold you like a note and keep you here
With me

The Roads You Can Take 
We drove through the rain
Past the evergreen trees
And we rolled just like the water
Along the veins of it's leaves
And we traced our memories
Into the shape of a map
Inside the palms of our hands
Bearing the secrets unkept
And i don't think i could ever feel this way again
You should be an actress because your so good at lying
You bring my to my feet and then you leave me here crying
If the feelings are gone, then what am i left with
Its true that we're young
But love is said to be ageless
The same is said of pain and desire and depression
Would it make it easier if i made you hate me
I only wanna see you happy
I only wanna see you smile
Ill take these pills and shove em down my throat to keep the words "i love you" from escaping my lips
To keep me sleeping and keep me quiet, still
"i love you" is the only thing i know for sure
If it's time you need my love, I'll give it to you
Ill give you my love if you say that it's time
Ill tear down the walls youve built up in our lives
As the barrier breaks between your heart and mine
You would die to forget, but i will live to remind you

Water's Edge 
I'm at the water's edge
And I'm gearing closer
This is where I will be
Where you can find me
My shadows kissing secrets
My heart's in agony
I never meant to make you cry
Love come back to me
Troubled boy i'll kiss you one
Last time and then say goodnight forever
Little girl, i'm not feeling well
These nights are long enough 
Without you
Who sends letters through the mail
Stop it keep calling my name
I'm fine left a lone
Change the lies you took the pictures of the wall
Stringing along like a beautiful love song
Carolina, carolina, carolina, carolina
Now that i have you may i use you as a muse
And keep you up all night with trading stories of whispering love
All i want, all i need
All i want, is to be oohh
Dodododododododododododododododo
Ohh
I'm sending letters through the mail
Accepting cherries at the table
Change the locks
Took the pictures of the wall
Stringing along like a beautiful love song

A Year 
It's been a year, and i'm in love
I just can't get enough
I made my choice, my choice is now
Stand up straight don't look, no cannot turn around

I spent a week down South
Reflecting back on how
The last year has gone
And you and me could reach the stars
(I know who i've become today)
We've only got 1 life
So let's make it our best
You've been here for a year
Will you be there for the rest?
We've gone so far since VALENTINE
Make a wish look at the time
I made a wish, my wish was you
And it looks like came true

We've only got 1 life

Both Our Souls 
I am moved by the sun
Cause everyone before me has seen the same one
And I can't wait to see the moon
Cause I know that it's the same one 
You'll see inside your room
Maybe it'll be alright
When my mouth is moving faster than my mind
Cause if I could change a life
Well then maybe both our souls will shine
Both our souls
Both our souls 
Will shine
And so I sing the first thing that comes to mind
Tell me what comes next
The answer comes in time
And I am slave to the sound
Which ever they may bring the world it will spin round
Maybe it'll be alright
When my mouth is moving faster than my mind
Cause if I could change a life
Then maybe both our souls will shine
Both our souls
Both our souls 
Will shine
Cause I remember when I was younger
A boy full of wonder
And I don't recall what made us grow old
I am moved by the sun

If you have got to let me go
Then maybe you should know

Things for only me
This is the last thing that I'll say
I'll say to you today
Forever for that sake
Redemption for the days
Where I would bite my tongue
Who said you were the one?
Won't you look into my eyes
Here's to us, here's your surprise
Can I have my life today?
The one you threw away
I'll swallow my pride someday

More 
So I'm asking you to stay
To throw all your old things away
I realize these games and I'm sorry 
But you need them more and more each day
If you would ever start
To see us fall apart
To feel the way I feel
I pray here in the dark
If there's a sign of feelings
Of any kind, you'll let me know
If there's a sign of another
Of any kind, you'll let me know
Could he give you more
Could he
Please believe me when I
Want to steal your breathe, well I try
Can't put to words
Try to capture your beauty, but I cry
(In your eyes)
I find a new
A place with a thousand emotions, yet just a few
To barely leave a mark
There's so much more for me to do
Will he give you more
Will he
If I could open my eyes, and realize
That you are right next to me
There is no mask, no cover
There is no other
No other in her eyes
I could give you more
I could 
I could give you more

Running through the trees
And as the years go by
There in front of me
And don't you feel it now

Maybe I'm just a little bit older

My feelings towards you
Rays of light destroy the night
You'll be there when I call
And there's a new voice
I took my time, I noticed how
I'll be there when you call
Got to get away now

I'm lost and so alone
All I want are my dreams back
All I want is a song
Cause at night when sleeping
And my thoughts have their way
My body lay still
But i still hear you say
You have always been my everything
But life's too short so we went separate ways
And thats when I wake up
Life slaps me in the face 
Can somebody please take me
To the place I was before
Before I knew the life
That lived behind those doors
Well this times different
And everything has changed
I may not be listening 
But i can still hear you say
You have always been my everything
But life's too short so we went separate ways (2x)

She Saves Me 
Fall to the ground, my life is found
A pretty boy in the saddest part of town
We drove for miles and we turned around
To the hospital to make sure you're safe and sound
She'd come over late at night
A beautiful girl, beautiful eyes
The timing was just right
Its a shame you were never mine (and she said)
It's crazy
Sure ain't what it seems
It saves me
Can you tell me what you mean?
I realize what I have to do
I close my eyes pretending what's not true
As dusk approaches without you
Laying in a field with the everwhite moon (while she said)
It's crazy
Sure ain't what it seems
It saves me

There's nothing left to say (oh no)
Even if the stars don't fall tomorrow
Even if the sun don't fade away
After all I still love you
After all is stripped away
As the light begins to shine down
I become more alive
Further than expected
Cause it'll be worth it, worth it in the end
Even if the stars don't fall tomorrow
Even if the sun don't fade away
After all I still love you
After all is stripped away
Even if the stars don't fall
If the sun dont fade

but the fear in ya heart, when you see the gift

Yo, everytime I rest, I put it all on the line
yo money never slept
that's why I barely get blessed
that's why I rarely go out, unless it's love at the club
time is bread, that's what I'm about
and all my peoples got cloud

the game is to be sold not told
I tropping heavingly, world connected got the livest crew
we infinite, dropping gems but no clue
[Chorus]
[Alchemist]
Every dollar I spend on wax , I turn it back into cash
Jetting back to the lab, I'm getting back on my job
I'm fully backed by the Mobb, I keep my back to the wall
keep the blacks to my wall
I'm trying to stack till I ball
untill they cashing em all
I wanna stack till this tall
ain't gonna rap for to long
gonna have to move on
I'm gonna stash till I'm gone
green grass on my longue 
fuck a bank account, I need extreme cash in my palm
smoke blur in ya vision, 
you don't know who ya dissin'
I don't learning no lesson
I just hold my position
I don't go with a pistol
they just know I'm official
shit, all I gotta do is start blowing a whistle
my name is ringing
my chain is swinging
right now I'm speaking, but these beats are what I'm famous for fleaking
[Twin Gambino]
It's like rolling dice, we taking the bank tonight
cut your face with a knife, now your scared for life
all I want is ice, a car, a girl and a crib
tired of doing biz, I just wanna live
take care of my kids, fuck all that stress
never wore a vest, only holding tecs
[Chorus]
[Evidence]
We sold out every store in L.A.
It's loyalty where I stay, but ain't promised today
I keep my headlights on for 9-1-1
and on July 4th I might shoot one at the sun
independent regardless of the fact I'm a signed artist
fuck a deal it matters who comes hardest
when I entertain, It's like I took Sedrick for his name
hunger is just a different form of pain
I'm ready to eat, ready to hear my name spread on the street
to the point where I don't talk, my trackrecord speaks
to the point where I do a joint, that night it leaks
to the point where Alchemist is a hundred grand a week
bringing the heat, so clear you understand me
raise the stakes, up the antique
the better place, yo we land on winds
Dilated, Evidence, Alchemist, Big Twins
- Check it out

New York, New York, The Empire State
I live hell nigga this the belly of the beast
I step foot out the crib, no shit
Gotta bring that hammer cause the drama don't quit
Everybody want to be king, they ain't fit
Look how I disrespect their team, cause they ain't shit
They got good talk, but that's about as far as it go
When it's time for that murder...they don't show
When it's time for that fighting niggas is ghost
All you hear is straight crickets, niggas is bitches
I learn you niggas how to handle your business
That's word to everything I love and God my witness
Bring that shit, I'll show you how to work them millimeters
Bet my heater will smoke like reefer
All I wanna do is get my money and re-up
Take a steps to all sovereignly for my freedom
Not trying to get caught up in global court
Fucked up trying to fight the case by global laws
Out in the Netherlands I got a better plan
I murder the powers and let Chuck fight them

Don't make me have to body some(thing) (f'real thun , word)

The Midnight Creep 
(feat. Havoc, Twin)
[Havoc]
I give 'em to 'em gutter, straight gutter
Ain't no other way to spit it, my nizzy, just fall easy
Niggaz want a peace treaty, wanna bring the calm
But when it's on, ain't a thing that can stop the pound
Tear a fella a ass, a new ass at that
Glad to clap, never that, we had to clap
Nigga do it to they self, when they force the hand
Make me blast, how you trynna play me man
Like niggaz over here, don't get down for theirs
I need some man time, who got the fuckin' jack in here
Where, ever I leave, my head's my home
And if possible, always take my gat where I roam
These slugs'll take the bass outta niggaz voice quick
But, once we gangsta, now moist the shit
Scramble, he hit, how you like the scenery bitch
Keep ya eyes on my hands, fuck who you seeing me with
[Chorus x2: Havoc]
Yo, I don't know you, you don't know me
Just mind your own business, everything'll be sweet
We don't talk over here, we just speak with the heat
You don't wanna see a nigga, on that midnight creep
[Twin Gambino]
And that chains over here, I'm just still bustin' my gun
Still rippin' on your shorties, wildin' out with my dunns
On the grind, don't do nothing dumb, just hold ya head
Cuz the rest of my soldiers, stressed out in jail
With on bail, facing the rest of they life
We got to get it right and keep it tight, and stay on the low
For them assholes, clockin' our dough, love when I flow
Keep doing that shit, they gots to go
Infamous Mobb gots to blow, pounds of dro'
Makin' all the shorties, gettin' down on the floor
From that Murda Muzik shit, that'll make ya flip
And dump a clip, in a nigga that be talkin' shit
We think sick, check the credits, we get busy
And grimey, and gritty, when we livin' in the city
It's haters, traders, fake ass playas
Come to QBC, and nobody could save ya
[Chorus x2]
[Havoc]
Of course we keep it gangsta, straight gangsta
Niggaz know it, I don't have to prove it, or show it
The gun bark, and the bite is a mutha, a killa
A playa, lay it down, a four pounder
The calm downer, when niggaz act a little too active
Smack kids into next week, little bastards
Ya'll cats think I'm playin' with this rap shit
I'm here to take it to the top, you fuckin' faggots
[Chorus x2]

Always Wanna Be With You 
Chorus: I don't ever wanna lose you baby
I always wanna be with you
All you gotta do is learn to trust me
And I promise that I will stay true
I don't ever wanna lose you baby
Always wanna be with you
All you gotta do is learn to trust me
I promise that I will stay true
I know that it's been hard on you
And I know that I'm not always with you
But you need to know that I do love you
And forever that's the way it will stay
And I know it's hard to trust me
When I'm always out with all my boys
It's my job and I will never be broken
When I go home, it's with you Ill stay
I try too hard to keep this going
And I will as long as you do too
Plus I love you and I will always will do
I only wanna be with you
I wish I had the time to show you
You mean the world to me and that's the truth
I don't wanna be with no one else, boy
I only be with you
Chorus
I don't ever wanna lose you baby
Always wanna be with you
Do is learn to trust me
I promise that I will stay true
Trust me cause I love you
I say I love you cause I really mean it
I never felt this way before
Look at pictures of me when I'm gone, boy
I'll be the one you breath
Oh, wait you're the air I breath
Inspiration, you're the song I sing
I don't ever wanna lose you baby
Always wanna be with you

Baby I Love You 
Baby I love you and I'll never let you go
But if I have to boy I think that you should know
All the love we made can never be erased
And I promise you that you will never be replaced
I love you, yes I do
I'll be with you as long as you want me to
Until the end of time
From the day I met you I knew we'd be together
And now I know I wanna be with you forever
I wanna marry you and I wanna have your kids
nothing could ever compared to the feeling of your kisses
I can say I'm truly happy to this day
You make me thank god i live my life everyday
There's never been a doubt in my mind 
That I regret ever having you by my side
But if the day comes that I have to let you go 
I think there's somthin' I should probably let you know
That I enjoyed each day I spend with you
And I will miss you but I'm happy that I had you at all
Baby I love you and I'll never let you go
But if I have to boy I think that you should know
All the love we made can never be erased
And I promise you that you will never be replaced(2X)
I love you ohh yes I do
I'll be with you as long as you want me to
Until the end of time

Burn (Female Version) 
I dont understand
Why?
See its burning me to hold onto this
I know there's something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm trying to say is 
That I....love you, I just
I dont know
Its just coming to an end
Then it's better for me, to let go now
Then to hold on, and let it hurt
I gotta let it burn
It's gonna burn for me to say this
It's coming from the hurt
It's been a long time coming
But we've been and fell apart
I really wanna work this out
But I dont think it's gonna change
You do but I dont
I think it's best we go our separate ways
I'm the one who's been hurt in this relationship
I ain't happy baby, always lonely baby
Cause there's so many other things you gotta deal with
I think that we should let it burn
When you feeling aint the same and your body just dont want to
But you know you gotta let it go
Cause the party aint jumping like it use to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn
Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thoughts of a man with someone else
But you know thats its over
We know that its true
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn
Sending pages I aint suppose to
Got somebody here but I want you
Cause the feeling ain the same
Find myself, cal-ling your name
Fellas tell me do you understand?
And all my ladies do you feel my pain?
It's the way that I feel
I know it's too late
Gotta do what is the best
I can't go running back
What I gotta do now
To get my baby back?
OooOooOooh
I just dont know how I'm gonna do without my Boohoo
You've been gone for too long
It's been eleve days, umm-teen hours
I'mma be burning till you return
When you feeling aint the same and your body just dont want to
But you know you gotta let it go
Cause the party aint jumping like it use to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn
Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thoughts of a man with someone else
But you know thats its over
We know that its true
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn
I'm twisted cause one side of me is telling me that I need to let it go
On the other side I wanna break down and cry
OOoooh
I'm twisted cause one side of me is telling me that I need to let it go
On the other side I wanna break down and cry, cry
Ooo Oo Oo
Oo Oo Ooo
Ooo Ooo Ooo
Can you feel me burning?
Ooo Ooo Ooo
Ooooo OoooOoh
So many days, so many hours 
I'm still burning til you return
When you feeling aint the same and your body just dont want to
But you know you gotta let it go
Cause the party aint jumping like it use to
Even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn
Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thoughts of a man with someone else
But you know thats its over
We know that its true
Let it burn
Let it burn
Gotta let it burn

Can't Go On 
I cant go on, living, without you
I cant go on, without seeing you smiling baby
I cant go on, living, without you
I cant go on, without holding you in my arms
Sometimes people make mistakes in their lives
Why we have to end things this way
I guess im trying to say
That i really miss your lovin
And i really miss your huggin
Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday
I sit awake everynight, wonder if i'll ever find
I know that we fight
But then i try to see myself, with someone else
But i always see myself, running back to you baby baby
Cant go on living without you
All the times i said that i doubt you
Be there, i swear
It doesnt mean a thing and you mean everything, to me when your close to me
I get chills cos it feels so real
I cant resist boy i need your kiss
I just cant go on like this
Im trying to fight my tears 
Im holding back after all these years
I'll lose myself if you walk away from me again
Coz i gave you my heart
And not just a piece of it
I loved you from the very start
And that love can never go away
Im missin you everyday your gone
Since you went away, i've been lost
And when my phone rings
I hope its your call
But i'll just keep wishing things that just dont come true
and all of it just makes me sad
It dont help and then i end up getting mad at myself
Tell me baby why you wanna make me feel like that
Cant go on living without you
All the times that i said that i doubt you
Be there, i swear
It doesnt mean a thing, and you mean everything, to me when your close to me
I get chills coz it feels so real
I cant resist boy i need your kiss
I just cant go on like this
After all this time that passed
I still want you in my life
You were my first love and i want you to be my last
I still remember all of the mornings
we made a bed together and laughed
I wish that would last forever
Until you come back to me
All i have are old memories
Days of you and me
Still i wish you'd just come back to me
Im cryin every second your gone and i sit alone every night
Writing these stupid love songs
Baby come back to me
I know that things have changed
And i know that your in a different place now
But im willing to change to keep my place
Your the only man i've ever loved
How can you walk away and never look back
Never look back
Cant go on, living without you
All the times that i said that i doubt you
Be there, i swear
It doesnt mean a thing and you mean everything to me when your close to me
I get chills coz it feels so real
I cant resist boy i need your kiss
I just cant go on like this
I cant go on living without you
I cant go on without seeing you smiling
I cant go on living without you
I cant go on without seeing you smilin baby
Cant go on living without you
All the times i said that i doubt you
Be there, i swear
It doesnt mean a thing and you mean everything to me when your close to me
I get chills coz it feels so real
I cant resist boy i need your kiss
I just cant go on like this

Baby I just can't take it
I dont enjoy being hurt
I know I smelled that perfume, the make-up on that shirt
I don't believe his stories
I know that they're all lies
Bad as you are,you stick around and I just don't know why
If you  was ya man (baby you)
Never worry bout (what I do)
I'd be coming home (back to you)
Every night, doin' you right
I'm are the type of woman (deserves good thangs)
Fistful of diamonds (hand full of rings)
Baby I'm a star (I just want to show you,you are)
[Chorus:]
I know that you love me
Let you kiss and hug me
Baby you're the one I want and need
Baby good love and proctection
Make you my selection
Show me the way love's supposed to be
Baby I know that you love me, kiss me, hug me
Love me
[Verse 2:]
Your true beauty's description looks so good that it hurts
You're a dime plus ninety-nine and it's a shame
Don't even know what you're worth
Everywhere you go they stop and stare
Cause you're bad and it shows
From your head to your toes, Out of control, baby you know
If I was ya man (baby you)
Never worry bout (what I do)
I'd be coming home (back to you)
Every night doin' you right
You're the type of woman (deserves good thangs)
Wrist full of diamonds (hand full of rings)
Baby you're a star (I just want to show you, you are)
[Chorus:]
You should let me love you
Let me be the one to give you everything you want and need
Ooh Baby good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be
Baby you should let me....
[Bridge:]
Baby
You deserve better (you know you deserve better)

We should be together girl (baby)
With me and you it's whatever girl, hey!
So can we make this thing ours?

Missing You 
Things will never be the same without you  
What did I do to deserve this
I didn't even get one last kiss 
From you  oh baby
God took your love from me
He needed an angel so it seems
I need to feel your hands all over me
I need to feel you kissin me
I need to feel you holdin me
I need to feel your touch
Cuz I miss your love so much
And I can't keep on living this way
I need you here with me
Why would he take you away... from me
(Chorus:)
It's hard for me to tell you I love you
As I'm standing over your grave
And I'll know I'll never hear your voice again
Why did you leave me
Why couldn't you just stay
Because my world is nothing, without you
Now I don't know what to do with myself
I would've given you anything
Just to make you happy
Just to hear you say that you love me one last time
I'd go to heaven back over and over again
Just to prove to you, how much I need you here
There is nothing that I wouldn't do
I cry for you I lied for you
And there's no doubt that if I could take your place from heaven
I would die for you yes I would
I would rather give up my life
Then to see tears in your eyes
I can't stand to see you cry
(Chorus)
I just don't know what to do with myself 
I can't stop looking at those pictures on my shelf 
Knowing it was just one week ago, stood there and took that picture 
There just one thing that I want to know 
Why would god want to hurt me so bad 
Does he know how much it hurts to be missing you 
Baby, I'm missing you baby Im missing you
I love you ooh god damnit I love you
Why did he did he take you away,
Love mebecause I love you so
I miss you so much baby I just can't go on baby

Thinking never compare to the feelings of your kisses
I can say I'm truly happy to this day
You make me think that I could live my life like this everyday
There's never been a doubt in my mind
That I regret ever having you by my side
But if the day comes that I have to let you go
I think there's something I should probably let you know
Thet everyday that I spend with you
I will miss you cuz I'm happy that I had you at all
Baby i love you and I'll never let you go
But if I have to, boy I think that you should know 
All the love we've made will never be erased
And I promise you that you will never be replaced
Baby i love you and I'll never let you go
But if I have to, boy I think that you should know 
All the love we've made will never be erased
And I promise you that you will never be replaced
I love you, yes I do
I'll be with you as long as you want me to
until the end (the end) of time (of time)

One Life, One Love 
1st Verse (MC Epikz - Khmer): 
I remember the first the day, me and you first laid, 
Eyes on each other made me feel so special 
Like I had a angel holding me and wouldn't let go 
So as I let go my heart, the one you had from the start 
The one I know you wont tare apart, or leave in the dark 
Your like a spark, you seem to light up my days 
Everytime you smile I know there's happiness heading my way 
At night I lay in bed and I stare at the stars 
See the similarity in your eyes, and wonder where you are 
But then I know the place you'll always be is my heart 
Which you'll never ever part, since you made your mark 
If I could I'd give the world only to you 
Because the feelings I have are so true, so boo 
Coress my life with your heart, mind, and soul 
Promise me that you'll never let go, once you get a hold 
Cuz I wont I'm telling you this now 
That I'm yours forever and I'll always be around 
When your down, when you frown, bong solang da moi 
( I only love one and that's you ) 
Rol jewit bong joi owne sabai jet so owne gom proi 
( and all my life, I'll help you be happy so baby don't worry ) 
2nd Verse: MC Ryuu - Viet 
Understand, I wanna call you my baby/ 
Cuz I wanna look at you, girl u make my mind crazy/ 
I wanna make you mine ta love as my wife/ 
Cuz you're worth givin' my one love in a life/ 
You can ask anything of me, I'll be glad to/ 
And there's no heaven on Earth if it don't have you/ 
Epitome of da perfect girl, I wanna hug you/ 
A role model for my kids ta look up to/ 
Cuz with all my heart, u know that I love you/ 
And nothing in my life could ever stand above you/ 
We could take da world in a life/ 
I only like one type of girl, and you're the only girl in that type/ 
Cong em, Tinh yeu cho Em, Em khong biet may/ 
(And you girl, My love for you, you don't know) 
Nghi den em moi ngay, voi la hom nay/

3rd verse: (1st Half) MCRyuu 
And if you hold me tight, things will not get rough/

One Life, One Love (Remix) 
[Intro]
Milez: One Life, One Love.
FlipBoy: This one goes out to two special girls out there stole our hearts. I Love Julie...
Milez: I love you Roxanne. FlipBoy 
&
 Milez.
FlipBoy: Milez, show her how you love her.
[Verse 1: Milez]
Where do I begin? I was living a life where I was fighting to win,
I saw you then I started to spin,
You got me dizzy but it kept my mind busy,
After all it was only a stare didn't think Id really care,
Till I saw what it could turn out to be,
Girl don't get me started,
I felt feelings that I hearted,
I left a note on your locker, I feel retarded,
But I was shy and I didn't know why,
I'm just that type of guy,
When it comes to you,
You're one of a kind,
When I thought I knew you I was really blind,
You turned out better than I expected,
Just want you happy girl and feel respected.
[Chorus]
[Verse 2: FlipBoy]
The first time I saw you, I didn't think you liked me,
That was in french class where you sat beside me,
When we finally started to talk, we laughed and smiled,
I cherished every moment, it was so worthwhile,
Then I invited you over on a saturday night,
When you left I realized I needed you in my life,
The day I told you that I loved you,
You said it right back and it felt good too,
I promised you that I'd never hurt your heart,
Never take advantage of it or rip it apart,
Nor look you straight in the eyes and tell a lie,
I just want to be true to you, I have no alibi,
It's only been a few months but it feels like a year,
I'm so happy to be with you, I could shed a tear,
When I'm not with you, I feel you so lonely,
I just want you in my arms, tight as you hold me,
When I wake up in the morning you're on my mind,
And also in my thoughts when I go to bed at night,
My biggest fear in life is losing you,
I don't know what I'd do, I'd be a confuse fool.
[Chorus]
[Verse 3: Milez]
So this how it started, it started with a stare,
My eyes caught yours and created a glare,
I fell in love with your heart before your eyes,
You can talk to me girl don't have to tell me no lies,
Even when its hard to and makes you wanna cry,
I'm here for you till the day I die,
So why be so shy I want to help you get through,
That what I do so give me a chance,
I am starting to feel the romance,
That we got going on,
Be happy and forget all the wrong,
Got to do like me and move along,
Like a melody in song and forget the pass and live the present to the best,
I want you Roxanne, not the rest,
Everyday, every night,
Every way your right,
Some day, you might,
Stand out, shine bright,
Life is short you got choices to make,
I want you happy girl, not have a smile to fake,
It's a promise Im willing to take,
Not ready to break,
You should come see me sometime and stay a while,
You know I would run for miles,
Just to see you smile!
[Chorus]
[Verse 4: FlipBoy]
Anyways, this is my way of expressing how I feel,
And if you're still listening, you know I'm being real,
The first week together in front of that lake,
I let you know that to be together I'd do whatever it takes,
Movie after movie with you in my arms,
You feel completely safe 'cause you'd never be harmed,
My plan right now is to complete your world,
So don't be afraid to let me know you're a happy girl,
Its definite our love's infinite,
You've got the key to my heart and you've locked yourself in it,
I don't need to say I love you 'cause you already know it,
And there's nothing else to prove 'cause my heart already shows it.
[Chorus]
[Outro]
FlipBoy: You know I love you Julie. I never wanna lose you. I love infinite, now how much more do you love me? hehe.
Milez: You only got one life, one love. Don't hesitate no more. You got something to say, say it girl. I have something to say; I love you Roxanne. You always on my mind. Now it's you, tell me how you feel.

Pass Me By 
I no it's hard for me to tell u my heart 
To let u no exactly how I felt inside 
But if you were here right now, 
I'd pour out my soul 
I really wish you were here 
Time is going by very slow 
U were here with me jus a day ago
didn't I mean everything to u 
Or am I being selfish 
I know I don't ask for much, just to feel your touch and here you say I loved you 
Every now and then find a close friend, now you're gone 
Now it's hard at the end of the day coming home to an empty house 
I try to find the words to say but they jus won't come out baby 
How could you throw this away baby? 
How could you not be here today? 
I thought we had everything, u left me all alone 
Please come back home, I need your love 
I can still picture the look on your face, when I told you I needed some space 
I tried to work it out, make everything better baby I made a mistake 
I never meant to cause you pain 
I never meant to tell you to leave 
I'll try to change for you if you change for me 
I want ya back now come Back to me 
I no I told you couldn't take it any more 
But if your now here I cant go on 
How could you throw this away my baby? 
How could you not be here today? 
I thought we had everything, u left me here alone 
Please come back home 
25 hours have passed me by (Me by) 
25 hours have passed me by (They passed me by) 
25 hours have passed me by and I all I could think of was you 
26 hours ago I was laying right next to you 
Missing you and I need you in my life 
How could you just let me go? 
Ill be your best friend and your wife baby 
I'm gonna try to make it up baby 
So I can see you once again 
oh baby, my baby, I need you

Take A Chance With Me 
Everytime he let me down
You were always there for me
Telling me that he ain good enough for me
You were always on the phone
When I was all alone
And he was never home (no)
Should've taken your advice
But I thought it was love
And I never thought twice
Now I see that I was wrong
So I wrote this song, for you
To tell you that we belong together
[Chorus:]
Though you never thought about me this way
But I'm here to say today
That I love ya, I love you
He did me wrong,
But you were always there for me
But now I see, the only one wrong was me
How many years went by that I never realized
That you were there in front of my eyes
I never even noticed the way you looked at me
When I was getting ready to go out with him
Why did it take so long to see that I need you
Why did you take so long to open your heart
I wish that I knew now
What I didn't know then
Coz I would've been a little more smart
I'd have your heart
[Chorus:]
Though you never thought about me this way
But i'm here to say today
That I love ya, I love you
He did me wrong
But you were always there me
But now I see, the only one wrong was me
Take a chance with me
Take a chance with me
Baby
Take a chance with me
Baby take a chance with me
Coz I love you, I love you, I love you
Yes I do [ooh]
Baby coz I love you oh oh

Time 
Hmmmmm hmmmmm 
Oh I'm missin' you 
Baby I'm missin' you 
Mmm eyyy hmmm 
Baby I'm missing you 
Things'll never be the same without you... 
What did I do to deserve this 
I didn't even get one last kiss, from you 
Oh baby God took your love from me 
He needed an angel so it seems 
I need to feel your hands all over me 
I need to feel you kissing me 
I need to feel you holding me 
I need to feel your touch 
Cause I miss your love so much 
And I can't keep on living this way 
I need you here with me 
Why could he take you away, from me 
It's hard for me to tell you I love you 
As I'm standing over your grave 
And I know I'll never hear your voice again 
Why did you leave me 
Why couldn't you just stay 
Because my world is nothin', without you 
Now I don't know what to do, with myself 
I would've given you anything 
Just to make you happy 
Just to hear you say, that you love me one last time 
I'd go to hell and back over and over again 
Just to prove to you how much I need you here 
There is nothing that I wouldn't do 
I'd cry for you 
I'd lie for you 
And there's no doubt that if I could take your place in heaven 
I would die for you, yes I will 
I would rather give up my life 
Than to see tears in your eyes 
I can't stand to see you cry 
Cause it's hard for me to tell you I love you 
As I'm standing over your grave 
And I know I'll never hear your voice again 
Why did you leave me 
Why couldn't you just stay babe 
Because my world is nothin', without you 
Now I don't know what to do, with myself 
I just don't know what to do with myself 
I cant stand looking at those pictures on my shelf 
Knowing it was just one week ago, that i stood there and took that picture 
There just one thing that I want to know 
Why would God want to hurt me so bad, 
Does He know how much it hurts to be missing you 
Baby Im missing you 
Baby Im missing you 
I love you 
ooohh God damn it I love you 
Why did he did he take you away from... me 
Cause I love you so... 
I miss you so much baby I just can't go on baby 
Ohhhh oh

Cry (Traducao) 
Why do I feel so teary all of a sudden?
Who would know my sad heart..
Why do I feel so teary all of a sudden?
Who would know my sad heart..
Its one in the morning, the intoxicated rain is falling
Its a sleepless night..
Sometimes exhausted, bruised and painful heart
I try to remember everything
But all of them are just past memories
They're just traces of my faded laughter
The only thing that comes out are my deep sighs
I believed everything was forever.
I was stupid back then
One by one, they are al leaving me
I didnt hold onto everything yet, I wanted to forget you but
For the remaining time, I miss you
[Chorus]
I want to cry, I want to cry, this heart
Love goes.. Friends go.. everything goes...
You left me after you gave me a whole bunch of scars
You left me after you made me a dumb idiot
After I heard that my ex girlfriend was getting married,
I pretended to to calm but when I was alone, I was hurt
Girls these days dont want guys
They just want a lot of money and fast cars
So guys have to make a lot of money to love
As I get older, little by little, I get farther away from my friends
And once in a while I'd come across them, but it'd just be akward
I dont know if its you who has changed
Or if its me who has changed over time
[repeat Chorus]
You'll know when they all leave
You'd probably know...
You'll know when they all leave
You'd probably know...
Yo, this is my life story as it goes on day by day
I wonder if the skies are sometimes sad like me
I wonder how you are right now, listening to this song
I tell myself that I gotta smile, but I still shed akward tears
But I still have to smile
My throat gets tight and my heart is in pain, I want to cry
[repeat Chorus]

Danny's Interlude (English) 
I was looking for what I longed for 
I ran down the long road 
Everyday I wandered here and there, there and here 
Wandering around looking for you 
When you left me 
I reached out to hold your hand 
In the clear air 
In the deep blue sky 
The sun shines in our eyes

Everyday And Night (English) 
In this large world, there's only one, 
The gift that the heavens gave to me, 
My beautiful future wife... 
Everytime I see her, I can't breath
It feels like I'm looking at a picture, I fly across the sky
When I'm feeling on ya booty I gets high 
The scent of her brown hair, 
Please wake me up to voice that's better to listen to than any song
That's my shorty (Oh) 
The moment that you entered my life, all my pain was washed away
Who will block us now? I will protect you by your side you know? 
Everyday I fall in love with you 
Over and over, over and over baby 
Everynight I wanna make love to you 
Over and over, over and over baby baby 
You brighten up my exhausted soul.
You brighten up my past
We are still young so lets be together forever yeahh
I miss you even when I'm looking at you
I want to give to you even when I am giving to you
Girl let me take you to the top of the world 
I'm not jealous of anyone in this world. 
Day by day, night by night, I will dance for you
I want to give all my everything and put it in you
In your deep sea of your heart yeahh
Everyday I fall in love with you 
Over and over, over and over baby 
Everynight I wanna make love to you 
Over and over, over and over baby baby 
I wonder if you know how I feel
I woner if you feel the way that I do
Baby yeah always yes 
You're warmer than the sun filled with stars
(uh~) So your heart wont be scarred, 
So your eyes wont be filled with tears, 
I will be with you so your two hands will not be worn out
I will always run to you, I don't expect anything else
I'll be good without any regrets
I will tell you confidently, I will live as I forever love you
Everyday I fall in love with you 
Over and over, over and over baby 
Everynight I wanna make love to you 
Over and over, over and over baby baby

Feeling Hot (Hot Ddugo) (Ingles) 
(Verse 1) 
You don't need to be a man to see what we look like 
In our music there is oviously rap and tunes 
If we can keep this up forever 
Sometimes we'll just talk,and sometimes shake our heads to the beat 
(Feel Good) 
It all makes our blood run hotter 
Our music (Feels so Hot, Feels so Hot Hot ) 
Jeans which hang low 
And chains which reach as low as my bare belly button 
A hat which is so big it covers my face 
Shoes which are often scuffed up 
Afro corn Roll like a Doorag under my hood 
I am Hip Hop, that's my style from head to toe 
(Feels so Hot, Feels so Hot Hot ) 
(HOOK) 
(Feels so Hot, Feels so Hot Hot ) 
I won't rest as my heart 
(Feels so Hot, Feels so Hot Hot ) 
My red-hot youth 
(Feels so Hot, Feels so Hot Hot ) 
The MIC which I'm holding here in my hand 
(Feels so Hot, Feels so Hot Hot ) * 2 
(Verse 2) 
So many pretty young ladies 
I fall in love with them all today too and chackout their figures 
Is that nose real? Or is it the result of surgery? 
In the past in this world it was the country girl that came out on top 
That smile makes me laugh 
(Feels so Hot, Feels so Hot Hot ) 
You all, you all act so rash all the time 
I'm a knock out, take care 
In your head, your mind it is so hot you'll erupt like a volcano 
If you ask I'll give it to you Dirty Dirty 
I can't sleep 
Like a gentle lion I stroke your hair and ask to go to your house 
Its so much a part of the Korean man's nature 
(Feels so Hot, Feels so Hot Hot ) 
Listen to me, we made this place 
Now listen to my rap too 
This song here feels so Hot 
(HOOK * 2) 
(Verse 3) 
yo! I am the perfect illustration of youth 
Saturday night always feels so Hot, feels so Hot 
High up in the sky the sun feels so, so, so Hot 
The stage is full of heat 
Feels so Hot, Teed 
Feels so Hot, Danny feels so Hot 
I'm living and breathing and I can't stop 
My dreams feel so, so Hot

How Many Times (English) 
[HOOK] 
How many times, are you going to leave and then come back? 
How many days, do I have to wait without a word from you? 
I don't have the strength to hold you back anymore 
I must be getting weary 
The words, love changes, must be true 
I guess I have to let you go this way 
[TEDDY] 
Will you listen to me just for today, baby girl 
Understand, these are words that were hidden by sighs 
From the start, we didn't get along 
Our love wore out during out small and big fights 
Suddenly you'll say its over, and tell me I wont see you even if I die 
One day, one month, there weren't any calls from you 
Anyone can see you're a drama queen inside a movie 
I'm just a manikin without any expressions 
The love you talk about is childish 
I don't feel anything when your relentless tears fall 
How many times are you gonna cry? 
How many times are you gonna lie? 
How many times are you gonna say good bye? 
How many times

How many times, are you going to leave and then come back? 
How many days, do I have to wait without a word from you? 
I don't have the strength to hold you back anymore 
I must be getting weary 
The words, love changes, must be true 
I guess I have to let you go this way 
U just don't understand, U need another man. 
It's not the way I planned for you and me No No. 
[JINHWAN] 
Your voice, every night you're drunk 
Your face, tells me I'm not enough for you 
You keep pushing our love away 
I've never bought up anything with you 
With good bye, I'll bring this up 
[BAEKKYOUNG] 
This crooked love is too tough for me 
I will forget this weary form of mine 
My broken heart will be okay without you 
I don't like being without confidence, this part of me is a fool 
[JINHWAN] 
Our meaningless, endless fights 
Has left pain that hurts me deep inside 
How many times are you gonna cry? 
How many times are you gonna lie? 
How many times are you gonna say good bye? 
How many times 
[HOOK] 
How many times, are you going to leave and then come back? 
How many days, do I have to wait without a word from you? 
I don't have the strength to hold you back anymore

The words, love changes, must be true 
I guess I have to let you go this way 
You just don't understand, you need another man. 
It's not the way I planned for you and me No No. 
[Bridge] 
Without a change, I was alone from the beginning 
Why didn't you take in someone who only cared about you? 
Even if you try to go back, it's too late 
My mind is already trying to erase you 
[HOOK] 
How many times, are you going to leave and then come back?

One Love (English) 
The first time I met you, it was a cold winter day 
It was a lonely and hard day 
With you white smile, you gave me confidence 
I was so happy to fly away. I remember it like it was yesterday 
That time you said so many times, and a few hundred times 
Even the words make you tired, I'm not going to regret 
Even though everything doesn't go you way, don't forget 
I'm always here for you 
Wipe you tears now 
I'll give you comfort 
I'll give everything to you 
I'll prepare for your love 
I can see my happiness in your eyes 
When I see you far away, I feel happy 
It is so important for me to feel you being there 
You are rain in a dry land 
You are the sunlight in darkness 
You smile at me when I am tired 
My love is growing in you 
I close my eyes and think about you 
You are always mine 
Everything looks so happy 
I love you under the sky 
I'll watch you forever 
Even though everything changes in the world, I will always remember 
Forever 
Danny: Do you ever think about me? Remember when we're together? 
You know it..... You know it..... 
You are the love in my life 
You are the love in my life 
Wipe you tears now (I'll watch you forever) 
I'll give you comfort (Even though everything changes, I'll cherish it) 
I'll give everything to you (I'll watch you forever) 
I'll prepare for your love (Even though everything changes, I'll cherish it) 
My love....... My love....... My love.......

Without You (Traducao) 
Sem seu cheiro eu nao consigo descansar 
Sem seu ar eu nao consigo mais durmir
Sem seus lindos olhos eu no consigo enxergar o meu eu mesmo 
Sem dizer nada..voc se afastou de mim assim to de repente
Se voc estendesse a sua mo e me ajudasse eu faria tudo isso de novo
Se voc pelo menos disesse uma nica palavra..eu no choraria mais..
se voc me beijasse de novo talvez eu acordaria de novo
Mais se voc me deixar nunca mais poderei te ter..
Eu odeio pensar que voc pode estar com outro homem
mais eu ainda continuo te esperando,acreditando que voc voltar para mim
(1tym:)Refro
Voc ainda  nica para mim (nica para mim)
Eu morreria sem voc( sem voc )
Eu no quero deixar voc ir 
me diga porque,porque baby
Eu no tenho muito oque te dar...(o que te dar?)
desde que voc esteja do meu lado 
Eu apenas no quero que voc me deixe
me diga porque
porque eu apenas no consigo viver sem voc... 
Voc e eu ficavamos todas as noites juntos
e voc sempre escrevia suas msicas de amor para mim..
sorrindo nas fotos do nosso lbum..sempre feliz..
e agora eu me sinto to vazio..sem voc.
Aquelas canes de amor que eu sempre quis que voc cantasse comigo
Aquelas estrelas l no cu que ns sempre viamos juntos
Voc realmente no quer mais voltar para o meu corao?
Se tudo isso acabou realmente..eu terei que te esqueer..
e mesmo assim ainda continuo te esperando aqui..
Refro repete*
Rapper (teddy:)
E em meu corao ainda consigo ouvir sua respirao
e preenche o vazio no meu corao que voc deixou
Porque voc me deixou de repente sem dizer nada?
As vezes esse sentimentos doi em minha mente
Eu no te odeio,eu odeio te amar..
Meu futuro era estar com o seu
estou certo de que voc ainda voltar para mim 
Eu sei eu sou um idiota por ainda acredito nisso 
mais  o meu corao que no aceita
Eu estou certo no jeito em que eu penso
quando voc me deixou 
as nuvens brancas um dia cubriro o cu
se um dia eu consigir fazer voc entender que eu
sempre estarei esperando por voc 
mesmo que demore muito tempo
mais eu no me importo mesmo que estiver cansado de te esperar
Meu amor por voc nunca ter um fim
para sempre,at em outra vida...
refro repete..* 2(x)
Viver sem voc
viver sem voc
Acho que vou ter que aprender a viver sem voc...

Everytime You Go Away 
Everytime you go, you take a peace of my heart (Hahah)
(yes yes ya, and you dont stop) You dont stop(yes yes ya, and you dont stop) Rock on
(yes yes ya, and you dont stop) Everytime you go (you dont stop)
(yes yes ya, and you dont stop)
Rap 1:
My eyes adore you, you must be having said I get a chill like a child,
When I think of the times we spent in eachothers arms
We can take on the world, and noone can harm my loveJust cryes out like a dove, to be above all the pain, and yet to remain was a game
That I cant explain, I wish youd open your heart and let your mind do the same
But now youve run away, couldnt stay another day,
To many problems in your head, just wouldnt fade away
You was the first to tell me right from wrong, Im cold and alone
And plus noone to share my song
When Im with you, birds over feather, Since you gone in a nice stormy weather
I pray to God each and every day, that youll stay and never run away, cause
Chorus:
Everytime you go away, you take a peace of me with you
Everytime you go away, away, you take a peace of me with you
Bridge:
Everytime you go, you take a peace of me with you, with you
Yes yes ya, and you dont stop
Yes yes ya, and you dont stop
Rap 2:
Back to the matter of hand, here comes the masterplan, to be replace by another
You betreat her like a step and stone and move on,and then you tried to get even and find another lover
Why must we get burn just to learn?
And in the game of life, each love is a lesson
I take my feathers and touch them to my back, so when I blow on the outside
You know what Im stressin, I never knew a love like this I confest
No matter what I say or do, I regret
Inside my heart you made a brighter day
So please never take your lve away
Chorus:
Everytime you go away, (everytime) you take a peace of me with you (you go)
Everytime you go away, (everytime) away, you take a peace of me with you
Bridge:
Everytime you go, you take a peace of me with you, with you (you take a peacwe of my heart)
Everytime you go (thats right) , you take a peace of me with you (so alone every day),with you (so much pain when you go away, uh cmon)

Lean On Me 
Sometimes in our live, we all have pain
We all have sorrows, but if we are wise
We know that theres always tomorrow
Lean on me (can you hear me now) 2-4 Family
Lean on me (depend on me)
I thought I heard you saying
That youve got hard times
If you feel that way
Why dont you drop me a line
`Cause Ill be there
To lend you a shoulder to cry on
Im true blue the type of family member
That you can rely on
Fly on and hold up your head
Open up your ears and listen up
To what the dread said
Dead is the only way youre hopeless
Youre still alive
So you need to take the time to scope this
Chorus:
Lean on me, when youre not strong
And Ill be your friend
Ill help you carry on
(Ill be your friend to the very end)
For it wont be long
Till Im gonna need somebody
To lean on (can you hear me now)
If thereis a load, you have to bear
That you cant carry
Im right up the road
I share your load, if you just call me
What ya going through, think
I wouldnt understand
Was there for you when you lost your man
Paid the costs for your faults
Paved the way to save the day
So whos the friend and whos the foe
In the end it always shows
And even though, I gave you doe
When you was dead broke
A place to rest you head
When you had nowhere to go
Never asked for a penny in return so
When its cold, zero below
Ill be your hero
Chorus
Ooh ooh (help you carry on)
(Ill be your friend to the very end)
(Can you hear me now)
(Two to the four)
So just call on me brother
When you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem, that youd understand
We all need somebody to lean on

Fabe
?a y est j'suis l?, 17h45, le stylo dans la main
Faut qu'jtrouve l'inspiration, le studio c'est demain 
24 heures, un micro branch?
Une fa?on d'approcher le rap ? mes principes accroch?s
Befa l'impertinent ou comme tu veux j'suis pas compliqu?
J'ai eu la th?orie, j'viens pour appliquer
Pour ?a qu'jai d? rappliquer, jur? j'vais m'appliquer
Si y'a un roi des cons, j'suis venu au monde pour le faire abdiquer
Pol?miquer, envahisseur dans un pays fliqu?
Si David Vincent vote FN, on va tous le niquer
Parce que nos voix prennent de l'importance
Parce que la vie n'est qu'une instance
Quand j'prends le micro j'm'en sers comme r?sistance
Juste avant qu'?a p?te
Quand un fr?re pleure, nos coeurs saignent
C'est m?me pas la peine demande ? Eben
Eben
Gravez mon nom dans vos t?tes, Eben
Comme ma voix sur sillon
Au mic comme un larso tourn? pour tuer
J'lache mes potions sinon comme d'hab
Un peu d'conscience dans un monde de fl?tes
Moi j'taf en stud avec Befa pendant qu'tous les ados chahutent
Mais j'ai pas le choix pour blesser
Il me faut un max d'?coute pour soit ?couter partout
ou c'est tout comme Kassav dans les crises de zouk
Mon C.V. aussi large que le nombre d'MC's dans l'hexagone
Mais si un film fa?on probl?me de la France c'est domtom
Eben toujours aussi droit, des convictions en b?ton
Des lyrics en b?ton et tant que j'y crois je laisserais pas b?ton
Constate beaucoup te pompent et aiment dans ton razzo tous les m?mes
Y'en a beaucoup qui savent voler mais ne s'appellent pas superman
2 Neg' c'est pas une love parade mais du pera bien crade
Refl?tant une poign?e de survivant qui ne se mettront jamais ? table
Premi?re Classe ce n'est pas la chance aux chansons ni d?barquer en chaud
C'est des gens comme toi et moi qui vont faire exploser leurs ?ditions
Ouais ouais, attends l? que je chauffe ma voix
Vas-y, vas-y parce que tu vois apr?s il y a Moko
Eben, tu peux prendre ton temps
Ouais ouais, ok bon, 
On fait quoi Jeff moi c'est bon j'enregistre, alors on y va
C'est bon pour moi on peut y aller

Poser dans 24 heures, 24 mesures sur un 24 pistes
24 raisons de me tracasser mes potes antiracistes
Prenons en main maintenant, l'arme du crime
Se presser d'?crire de la merde en se faisant des feintes non
Qu'au son du temps qu'il me reste j'ai id?e de ce que je dirais
De peu on s'aimera de moins en moins on s'aimera ca s'sent
On cr?e des gouffres qu'il est parfois dur de dompter
On chifonne, on se bat on se bouffe pour ce con de bl?
Dans ce monde o? on avance ment-douce
Les gens se talonnent, ne se lachent pas d'un pouce 
S'font pas fiance-con, qu'on se balonne de l'ambition 
Pour rien on se taponne le reste on temponne
On se fout de la tournure que les ?v?nements prennent 
Tirailler les m?chants trop de chaises, l'orgueuil pr?vaut
Je parle raide ? ceux qui r?vent de r?vo
M?me si les gens se devancent, le vent bourpe
Ceux qui avancent restent en groupe, grimpent
Et trempent pour les temps qui se trempent
on barbote pas dans le bon bain
Une chance pour les bambins
Les gosses sont de plus en plus pr?cosement lambin
Premi?re Classe, Eben, Fabe, Mokodaf 2

Donc je flingue et n'attends pas que cela se passe
Laisse la place, 2Neg et 2 Bal 3 x + efficace
J'arrive encore, kill au mic , kiloma?tre kill
G:kill kill ceux qui font de l'ombre a mon deal
Je suis blas? (blas?), blas? (lass?)
Ton bla-bla-bla j'l'ai cern?
C'est "fra"pour le hip-hop qui jump-up au top
Tandis que mes potes niquent la pop et la smoke non-stop
Yo bla-bla ! j'avance et tire dans le tas
Ma bouche crache des balles contre l'ennemi qui se dresse devant moi
C'est a ton tour, j'avance sur ce beat lourd
Mon intelligence d?crit les vices du syst?me qui m'entoure
Ecarte-toi gars, j'arrive et crache le feu
Je br?le tous mes ennemis les plus haineux
Tu es dans l'embarras le 3 a m?nag? son escadron
Ma 2 neg escadrille aujourd'huit poursuit son ascension
Notre album est sortit et le larron tr?passe
A l'heure qu'il est tu sais qui est 3 x + coriace
Rien qu'du v?cu , j'repr?sente ma famille et ceux de la rue
Boussif et tous ses fr?res qui sont tous pleins d'impr?vus
Toujours dingue, dingue, dingue, yo est ce qu'on flingue ?
Le 3 --est sorti et les wacks baltringuent
J'reste tenace, j'suis un las(car), j'veux du cash , des liasses
Laisse-moi te conter l'histoire du "3 x plus efficace" 
Refrain
Yeah !! 1 fois, 2 fois, 3 fois 
2 B.A.L niggets shoot pour le MA3
Ca s'passe, nous restons "3 fois plus efficace"
les pompeurs tentent mais nos attitudes restent de glace (bis) 
Entrez-bien dans les profondeurs de votre coeur
Entendez chanter les vibes de la vie
Y? ! Y? ! Yes !Une existence te tente...
J'casse l'atmosph?re de glace, change le climat de place
Sortie du "3e Underground" bonne ?cole, bonne instruction
Champion sound , maintenant mets ton corps en action 
Sucker die, sucker die, la technique reste au 3
J'enseigne, parce que le peuple est pour tous ceux qui pensent "3"
Crache et arrache ce putain de dialecte de ma bouche
Krokmitten est a tes c?t?s quand tu te shootes
Noire est la secte, le top de la select intellect
Perfect, directe s?che est la loi des n?gres ma?tres
"Bounty" c'est la f?te, v'la qu'les 2 bal viennent correct
G. and D. come from da black gang intellect 
Je ferai comprendre fermement ? l'ennemi sa disgr?ce
Car je renifle l'odeur de la mort, et cette odeur est tenace 
Refrain
J'entends crier (souffrir) le peuple affol?
Le diable a jet? une cataracte de n?gativit?
Y'a de bon gars et des malfrats mais Dieu seul jugera
Tous mes meilleurs soldats ? l'int?rieur de mon cheval de Troie (3x)
3 x + rapace, coriace
Tant d'ann?es de combativit? pour rev?tir la place
Oh certains pensent que le rap ne vaut pas une charade
Explicite, noir et sinc?re au rythme d'un coeur battant la chamade
Emulation parfois bidonnes fatigu?es par des rumeurs connes
Une ar?te articule dans la gorge des consonnes
Youth hortical don dans la fishbone sonne
S'incruster sur un skeud suscite parfois des menaces au phone !
(carri?res du rap) combien sont-ils ? avoir quitter l'?quipage??
Des barbares hagards prennent mon vaisseau ? l'abordage
Mais... beaucoup tombent a l'eau, se noient
Puis se referment les tentacules du m?nage ? 3

Comme Un Oiseau Qui S'envole 
Refrain
Je voudrais loin d'ici si javais des ailes
Mes fr?res et moi dans les airs pr?s de l'?ternel
Planer aupres du soleil mettre son esprit sur veille
Croyez moi que la vie ne sera plus pareille
Avoir des ailes pour voler tout voir tout d?cripter
Toutes ces choses cod?es survoler mes mauvaises pens?es
Les gens me reprochent d'avoir une ?toffe 
De pas ?tre assez proche de mes proches
Mais quand t'as perdu ta m?re ? lage de 15 ans
L'insensibilit?e tu las payes cash content
D?stabilis? au niveau familial
La l'unit? jai appris avec des cannibals
Je pose veto fais vite dans un ghetto trop chaud
Finir super h?ros derri?re les barreaux
J'esp?re menvoler comme un oiseau la haut tout haut
Que mon fils n'est point un fardeau sur son dos
Une des choses que la rue elle m?me m'as appris
C'est que le macadam ? force sauto d?truit
Voil? pourquoi j'esp?re que grace ? ma mentalit?
Ma vitalit? je m'envolerais comme un f?nidr?
Refrain
Au vent je ne tourne pas le dos ce n'est pas un sketch
Je desside de prendre les mots de vitesse miss gaffe ? ton ketch
Les pieds coll? au sol j'aimerais prendre mon envol
J'?tudie tout les aspects de la vie depuis que jai stopp? l?cole
Comme une oiseau qui s'envole non pas comme un pigeon
J'ai acc?s sur tout ce qui ce passe dehors ou m?me en prison
Je continue mes d?lire de Sh?tane et autres sorte de pirouette
Sur la voiture de l'harlouch je balan?ais de crottes de mouettes
Comme un oiseau qui s'envole mes d?sirs saccrois
Mettre propre ma mille-fa MA3 en forme de croix
Gagner le jackpot comme au casino
Arrete pour chacun de mes potes que de la maille en lot
C'est trop pour certains et pas assez pour dautres
Je prends mon courrage ? deux mains pour que demain ce soit un autre
Jouant du micro je veux que tout le hip hop d?colle
Pour fuir comme un oiseau qui s'envole

Confiance 
Confiance, confiance, beaucoup te mettent en confiance,
Ma 3?me science ? moi, c'est la m?fiance,
D'apr?s moi, si t'a du bon sens, tu ne peux laisser ta chance,
? quelqu'un d'autre que toi de juger de tes comp?tences,
J'avance, la seule chose qui m'importe, c'est mon existence,
Avant tout, je pr?f?re ?tre seul, seul dans mes manigances
La prudence fait de moi l'homme que je suis, pour moi c'est une chance,
C'est une tactique technique que j'applique avec aisance,
Avec aisance, on a voulu me berner, mais patience,
Ma vengeance sera br?lante et tr?s intense,
La tra?trise s?vit dans tous les recoins sous forme de balance,
Ils sont jamais de taille, fausse racaille, ils m?ritent sentence,
Pas de confiance, non, la vie est intense,
Il n'y a qu'en enfance que l'innocence fait jouir d'inconscience,
H? gars ! s'il y a une chose que je peux te dire et que je pense,
C'est que je me m?fie de l'homme, comme je me m?fie de sa science.
Refrain
Yo ! Je navigue sur un champ min?,
O? amis ennemis sont durs ? distinguer,
Yo ! Conseil de fr?re, n'ai confiance en personne,
La confiance n'a plus aucun sens pour plus personne.
Je navigue sur un champ min?,
O? amis ennemis sont durs ? distinguer,
Je n'ai jamais enti?rement confiance,
Surtout quand tu vis dans un pays tel que la France,
Les boils d'un c?t?, les mul?tres de l'autre,
Les bicots en unit? et les re-nois qui se vautrent,
Trop de larrons s'introduisent dans mon G.A.N.G.,
Kill ? d?cid? d'?tre leur pire ennemi,
C'est comme une ?pid?mie, de quoi ces gens se nourrissent,
Ils veulent avoir ma confiance ou que je sois leur nourrice,
Malheureusement c'est le reflet d'la nature humaine,
Les flemmards s'en foutent, les fonctionnaires taffent pour la haine,
Toi, tu ne peux pas pleurer ? ma place,
Il n'y a que moi qui peux savoir ce qui se passe,
Plusieurs passe-passe, plusieurs coups fourr?s
L'un des deux s'est fait p?-cho, il est en train de morfler,
On est loin de penser qu'il va balancer,
Tout le monde ? confiance en celui qui s'est fait serrer,
? toi de distinguer tes vrais amis de tes ennemis,
? toi de savoir ? qui tu donne une partie de ta vie,
Conseil de fr?re, n'aies confiance en personne,
La confiance n'a plus aucun sens pour plus personne,
Apr?s tant d'?preuves, j'ai appris qu'il fallait faire confiance,
Qu'a soi-m?me pour ?viter les dilemmes,
La confiance se gagne ensuite elle se g?te,
Comme un dealer gratte en dollars ou Deutsch Marks,
Mais perd tout en quelques secondes,
Je sonde le coeur du monde quand il s'inonde,
Je t'invite ? ?viter cette ronde,
Une honte qui suit mon peuple depuis un centenaire,
Quand pourrions-nous laisser g?rer nos affaires,
Par des fr?res sans que ?a flaire,
Oh, yeah ! n'ai fois qu'en toi, m?fie toi des saligauds,
Trop de faux amigos jouent les beaux, se prennent pour tes pincos,
Imagine qu'un jours tes meilleurs potes deviennent riches,
T'aideront-ils ? ?tre riche ou ta situation, ils s'en ficheront,
Il ne faut pas avoir d'amis pour avoir des amis,
Vaut mieux rester en famille, cela ?vite les ennuis,
Oui surtout quand ta femme est belle, cela cr?er des ?tincelles,
Querelles mystiques juste ? cause d'elle,
Met la h?te quand t'a pas confiance en ces tchouopes,
Cela ?vite les carottes, que les maladies sales, tu choppes.

Toute la nuit sans qu'on ait peur de quoi que se soit
Laisse moi te guider ?te le haut tendrement et ensuite le bas
Je te murmurerai des mots qui te mettront hors de toi
Moi je donnerais tout pour que le jour ne se montre pas
Baby donne moi du sexe toute la nuit je veux du sexe
Refrain
Donne moi sexe baby
Toute la nuit j'ai envie de sexe
Darling jusqu'au petit jour sans que le jour ne se montre pas
Je veux ton corps en gage d'amour
J'aime le parfum de ta peau que tu laisses sur mes draps
La douceur de tes l?vres oh me font perdre mon sang froid
Je donnerais tout pour que le jour ne se montre pas
Baby donne moi du sexe toute la nuit je veux du sexe

Sexe sexe sexe ch?rie vas y fait le geste
Rassure toi en latex il faudra penser au next
Ah J'lache des rimes pour toi ? celles qui s'en cachent pas
A toutes les saintes n'y touches qui des que tu touches te font nada
Alors c'est ?a d?s lors t'y crois l'amour sans A
Fid?lit? une vie rang?e et tout son tralala
Le love bluff tes yeux et peine le dos tourn?
La m?me sainte s'esquinte ? force d'avoir trop tourn?e
Dur dur de " ber-tom " sur la bonne c'est s?r
Ouah ! car de b?ton sur un pouf ?a m'rendait ouf c'est s?r
Plus qu'une histoire de cul j'veux ton Q.I. aussi
J'renie pas la pratique mais je veux aussi de la th?orie
L'?me s?ur tant que je n'ai pas trouv? je brandirai ma flamme
Et si tu n'me crois pas j'aimerais toujours ta femme
Approche c'est dans l'approche B.B.

L?-bas pas un coup ? ferrer
Ouais, j'suis un cond? recal?
De chez les pompiers

J'fais plut?t dans la lessive
Sur le terrain on m'appelle " Tavares l'esquive ".

Vous me reconnaissez ?
Non. Ben, c'est pas grave

Mon cuir ? P?cho ? un tox dans un cave
Mon vice ? Foutre la merde dans les raves.

On va se placer chez Pernod !

Dans mon quartier on m'appelle Harrissa
En r?ference ? l'inspecteur Harry

Me parle que de l'Afrique
Je crois bien que cette catin veut se barrer avec notre fric
On se la flanque sur ?coute t?l?phonique ?
D'j? fait ! Je lui ai mise ? la Derrick
Et ta Binta ?
Sans papelard, mais son clit is good
J'crame un p?tard et elle m'appelle son Clint Eastwood
Elle skie dans la poudre,
Elle croit au coup de foudre
Gomes, elle sent m?me plus mes coups de coudes !
Et mate, mate, mate, mate

Il balance tellement, au central, lui ? son bureau
" J'ai un gros biz de Pok?mon ! "
Gomes faut qu'on aille raffler l'oseille des m?mes
En plus, il a des puces pour t?l?phone.

La Main Tendue 
H? j'ai bac plus deux, mais aujourd'hui, dis moi, ?a sauve de quoi ?
Je vois des gars dans la rue, je me dis que ?a poirrais ?tre moi,
Rien de bien, seul perdu dans un coin,
Regard bris?, en qu?te de l'aide d'un de mes prochains.
Vois la vie de rue, c'est pisses de chiens, c'est d?tritus,
La paume des mains tendue, tu peux pleurer, personne n'y croit plus.
Sans domicile, les r?sidents du monde ext?rieur
Profitent de la chaleur d'un quai de m?tro pour de meilleures heures.
Non c'est pas de ?a que je veux comme destin,
Ce que je veux pour demain,
C'est plein de choses bien pour moi et les miens.
Je suis t?moin du mal, j'ai peur de voir ce que sera demain,
Pour moi, les miens et cuez qui vivent en tendant la main,
Victime du regard des autres, jug?s en une seconde
De part l'apparence, de part l'odeur naus?abonde.
? grande vitesse, c'est ici que ta vie peut atterir.
Je d?die ce texte ? ceux qui le vivent et souffrent le martyr.
Refrain
? ceux qui vivent la main tendue, ce texte je d?die.
? ceux qui vivent le stress, ce texte je d?die.
T?moin du mal, je vois ceux qui n'ont pas droit ? la vie,
Ceux qui meurent sous nos yeux, qui s'?teignent et qu'on oublie.
Dehors le froid, c'est chaud, pas de couverture, ni matelas,
Les keufs tournent et peu de plans quand l'hiver s'abat sur toi.
Un r?ve de lit, r?ve de vie qui r?ve de lui,
Faire une tr?ve aussi ainsi pour contrer cette maladie.
La bouf c'est dead, en plus, pas de tune dans ses poches,
Son ventre vide, quand des gens bouffent,
C'est vrai que c'est moche mais il s'accroche.
Il oublie le futur, mais pense au temps qui passe,
Penser au pass?, ? pr?sent, c'est l? que son sang se glace.
Manger, c'est clair, pour lui, devient une n?cessit?,
Car le mois s'annonce comme un ramadan, impos? mais non forc?.
En vrai, la volont? de s'en sortir le maintient au contact,
?vite le cons sans tact ou les regards qui se braquent.
Et comme tout le monde, c'est fini, son impact, l'infini,
La poisse a sign? un pacte avec le diable, sans demander son avis.
Seul et mal entour? de tours, eh !
De gens remplis de conseils, et, parfois mal renseign?s.
La nuit, c'est le jour, la jour, la nuit, c'est du pareil au m?me,
Le vrai soleil, c'est sa survie avant que les lumi?res s'?teignent.
Des amis, il en a de tou-par, mais sont remplis de remparts,
? part ceux qui ont v?cu la m?me histoire, m?me si c'est rare.
Genre, imagine-toi ? sa place, confront? ? tout, la vingtaine pass?e
Et je suis s?r que c'est arriv? pr?s de chez vous.
Une fin sans fin, en in de compte plus d'histoire sans fin,
Pour tous ceux qui sont dans la rue, baisser les bras n'apporte rien.

Le Prix Requis 
Je suis le pr?dateur, le coeur de pierre par pudeur.
Quoique tu fasses, rien ne me raisonne, je garde ma rancoeur.
Quand l'heure est ? l'affrontement, aux r?glements de comptes.
La violence est une tentation telle que je succombe.
J'affronte quiconque me fait de l'ombre
Et puis je ne m'encombre surtout pas de sentiments.
Sur moi Satan est influent, j'ai pas le temps de t'?couter,mec,
Ta morale est veine. La haine a sem? sa graine,
Gangr?n? mes g?nes, j'ass?ne les coups.
Je laisse rien passer, j'enfonce le clou.
Je fais tout pour envenimer les choses, mon cerveau bout.
Le tout est qu'on me craigne.
Je suis en rogne, faut que je cogne et que ?a saigne.
Que tout le quartier sache que je suis une putain de teigne.
Et tant mieux s'il y a du monde autour j'accentuerai ma hargne.
Je ferai encore plus de bruit pour que le bruit coure.
Lourd est le parcours d'un enfant mat? par une vie pav?e 
D'emb?ches ?triqu?e par le passisisme traqu?.
C'est la r?gle, tu as le choix, tu es la proie ou tu es l'aigle.
Ici y a pas d'exutoires, c'est la bagarre, pas de rem?de
Au malaise qui p?se sur mes ?paules, abaisse mon esprit.
Laisse place aux mesquineries de la rue.
L?, je me rue sur la seule arme que j'ai sans regrets.
Ici, c'est le prix requis pour le respect. 
Refrain
Attention aux descendants, qui un jour me descendront.
Le respect, je l'ai acquis sans demander pardon.
Attention aux descendants, qui un jour me descendront.
Le respect, je l'ai acquis. J'en ai fait ma cloison. 
H?, yo! Mate le boug gars, son nom me reviens comme une boomerang.
J'entends parler de lui, de Fleury jusqu'? Zoneland.
Merde, mais pourquoi tout le monde me parle de lui.
De ses violences gratuites, faits et gestes qui ont pourri des vies.
Ainsi, pour obtenir le respect faut se comporter comme Sh?tan.
Blasph?mer des ?mes, avoir des fans, ne jamais rester calme.
Au fond, jem'en fous de ce que tout le monde pense, c'est moi le boss.
Je suis le boss, il ne peut qu'en rester qu'un, je survivrai car je suis le plus f?roce.
Le craindre, c'est marquer des points dans sa r?putaion.
Le renier, m?me si tout le monde a peur, cr?era son amputation.
Tout le monde se bat, la rue, une ar?ne dans une jungle.
Flingue cach? pour obtenir le troph?e, est-ce bien lui le plus dingue ?
J'en ai connu d'autres qui se sont vautr?s par exc?s de confiance.
Trop s?rs d'eux, un mauvais pas a fait basculer la balance.
Comme lui, je viens d'un ghetto touch? par la maladie.
Deviens marginal dans un syst?me qui m'a ?cart? et pourri.
L'esprit foutu un coeur aigri qu'on parle de moi et sans r?pit.
Si la rue est mon territoire, que je d?truise tous ses interdits.
L?, je me rue sur la seule arme que j'aie sans regrets.
Ici, c'est le prix requis pour acqu?rir du respect. 
Refrain 
J'avance ? grand pas mais je surveille mes arri?res.
Ainsi j'esquive tes coups bas, j'?vite la civi?re. 
Pas ? pas, mon nom prends du poids, ? ri-Pa je prends mes rep?res.
Pour ne pas finir au fond d'une rivi?re. 
Aujourd'hui, c'est moi, mais attention aux pr?tendants, ? mes descendants.
Qui une fois plus grands me descendront.
Je romprai pas les ponts avec la cit?, c'est pas possible.
Plut?t qu'une vie de mendiant, je pr?f?re ?tre cible. 
Dans la ligne de mire, c'est la merde, mon empire les emmerde.
Et le pire, c'est que c'est raide de garder sa place sans faire du surplace.
Ne jamais couler, car c'est ? la surface qu'on me rend des pi?ges fa?on crevasse.
Juste pour qu'on m'efface. 
Faut pas que je me pr?lasse, la voie que j'ai choisie, h?las.
N'est pas des plus communes, mais j'assume. 
Dans le bitume, j'ai grav? mon nom et acquis ma place.
Accrois mon volume, faut que je terrasse pour sortir de la brume.

L'impact Des Mots 
G-Kill
Avec un mot, une phrase, un texte j'peux crever des tympans,
Pousser les jeunes ? nek le syst?me 
Vas-y guette un peu, l'impulsion qu'ont les mots quand j'mets la tension,
Faut qu'il tue l'son et qu'les jeunes aux paroles fassent attention,
Attention si tu parles faux l'addition sera sal?e,
Bonne diction faut qu'ils comprennent qu'hardcore la vie c'a l'est,
Ma parole faut donner baffes aux trop jeunes insens?s,
Incendier les bafs avec des paroles trop sens?es,
Termine ta sensi, l'impact des mots est d?moniaque,
C'est comme si ? ta ptite soeur de 10 piges tu lui disais d'fumer une gnack,
Faut prendre conscience qu'on sensibilise trop d'jeunes,
Dans l'rap faut en avoir dans l'froc pas dire des trucs shuns,
Le rap un gun poser sur la tempe des petits fr?res,
Si tu trembles leur t?te explose sans qu'tu puisses rien y faire,
On s'rend pas compte de l'impact des mots,
On oublie qu'dans l'public y'a des mamans et des m?mes. 
Refrain (x2)
D'apr?s toi on fait pas attention ? c'qu'on dit
On sait qu'il y a des gens qui se prennent la t?te
Et que tu dis les textes qu'on ?crit attention ? ce qu'on dit
T'as compris ces paroles sont pour les grands comme les petits
Rohff
Fier de moi tonton flingeur d'conscience,
Tel un coup d'feu sursaute sur la phrase des qu't'as compris l'sens,
Y'a des propos qu'j'peux plus tenir m?me si crapuleusement ca dechire,
On s'donne l'avocat du diable, premier ? m'applaudir 
J'peux plus dire la m?cr?ance prosthasie,
Plus d'alcool moins d'fume nique la coke et l'ecstasy,
A l'image d'nos predeceseurs, pour la note des sucesseurs,
Aie ta propre personnalit? j'aime pas les suceurs,
Nique les phantaisies mensonges qui engrainent 
Moi j'songe ? t'eloigner d'ses illusions qui t'bouffe la vie comme la gangrene,
Au risque que mes disques ne fassent pas d'bonne vente,
J'suis pas d'ceux qui s'vante ou qui suce ou qu'invente,
J'chante la v?rite crue voir gore m?me ?pouvante,
Le coeur anesthesi? a force de douleurs ?prouvantes,
Rod?e par des histoires inhumaines ? vous faire mal au ventre,
Avec mon ?criture fait vivre une ambiance ?mouvante,
Au studio en voiture ou ? la baraque,
C'est pas l'poste qui fait l'son non c'est rohff qui casse la baraque.

Ma Vision Du Monde 
9-7, une page se tourne et les m?mes tours de b?ton m'entourent,
m?me vie, m?me vision, m?me parcours, que j'affronte chaque jour,
trop lourd, grisaille pas de maille, b?ton en toile de fond,
trouble vision, ? l'horizon, gar?on rien de bon.
Tension, pression, un vie o? tests et baston abondent,
la seule vie qui corresponde et rime ? ma vision du monde.
A chaque seconde, les yeux ouverts sur mon univers,
je vois que mon paradis n'est qu'un enfer de b?ton sur terre,
une poudri?re, o? moi et les miens vivont les m?mes gal?res.
Rien de bien ? faire au quotidien, non rien ? faire, fr?re,
je viens de ce coin du monde o? on habite les uns sur les autres,
l? o? le quotidien n'est autre que des jeunes qui se vautrent,
de mon c?t? du globe, c'est des tours de b?ton arm?,
des voitures cass?es, immeubles d?labr?s, vies d?glingu?es,
tu sais que c'est vra, si la vie dehors tu connais,
j'?cris ce que je vis et retranscris la r?alit?.
Refrain
Par mes yeux observe ma vision du monde,
la vision d'un monde o? enfer et?ton se confondent.
J'habite la grisaille, le tours de b?ton arm?.
Je viens de ce coin du monde aux tours ?lev?es, cit?s d?vast?es.
En haut, mate le ciel plus souvent gris que bleu,
garde les pieds sur terre, reste conscient, ouvre les yeux et, mieux,
constate qu'autour de moi rien ne va plus, c'est cause perdue,
le regard froid, l?s?, d??u, ? esp?rer je suis promu,
le monde, c?t? malsain, a son mal et son bien,
son histoire sans fin, des gens qui mangent mal et d'autres qui mangent bien,
l'impression de louper la coche, c'est vrai, que c'est moche,
poches vides, c'est la deum, prie que ?a arrive pas ? un de tes proches.
P?re, ma vision est ? perte, faut pas que je perde la foi,
faut tenir le bon bout, m?me si certains ont les foies et des fois
je vois, pense, critique, parle un peu trop fort,
?tant pi?g? en quarantaine dans leur chateau fort.
Dehors, le froid touche mais personne s'en pr?occupe,
la pauvret? reste une cible pour tous ces fils de...
2 N E G fig?s, vision du monde r?dig?e,
pour mieux se diriger contre eux voil? 2 N E G.
Refrain
Cit? d?vast?, ?lign?e, cit? oubli?e,
c'est la m?me tu le sais, et je le sais dans les m?mes ghettos fran?ais,
la m?me fa?on de penser, m?me vision fauss?e,
m?me quartier fonce-d?.
Partout m?me pression exerc?e, fatigu?, lass?,
de vivre entre cafards et vide-ordures,
plus cette vie dure, les murs de ma cit? se fracturent.
Mes yeux sont ouverts et dirig?s vers l'envers
du d?cor et persiste, p?re, op?re pour mes fr?res, dehors.
D'ailleurs un accord c'est dead, bien plus mort que mort.
Je r?ve plus de rien, puis tape pour ?viter leur mise ? mort.

et plus c'est consistant plus les 2 Neg' sont r?sistants.

Meilleurs Voeux

Que seulent les sages interpr?tent nos messages
Signe de mauvais pr?sage la rage sur les visages

Violence en avalanche ma rime d?range parce que franche elle est

Je doute que le P?re No?l puisse exaucer mes voeux
car je souhaite moins de sang d'oppression
et d'?go?sme  d'incompr?hension abouttisant au racisme 
et que le P?re No?l n'oublie pas ceux du ghetto fran?ais 
qui entre violence et souffrance sont forc?s de danser

Noir Et Blanc 
Je vis au jour le jour, la nuit comme la nuit
Vis ma vie sans r?pit, en d?pit de certains MC
Noir ou blanc, tant que je ne tache pas tous mes principes
Je m'en ouf. Le pe-ra souffle l'antipathique qui trippe, flippe
Un babtou qui rape mieux qu'un noir, ?a d?range
Je pr?f?re voir un blanc chez nous,
Qu'un noir dans la techno se disant aux anges.
O? sont les vrais ? Ou dites moi qui sont les faux ?
Dites-moi qui sont les mauvais,
Ou les vrais conditionn?s par les mots ?
Rap positionn?. L'extr?me pousse la position.
Ciste-ra par le verbe. N'agr?mente pas ta direction.
La b?ton, la rue, une vie, une vision, un mur, des cons, c'est perdu !
Une le?on et tr?s peu de fiction
Tatouage au corps 3-6. Aveugle humain
O? est le bien quand le mal vole son bien ?
? certains, et le saint n'a peut-?tre pas de cornes
Mais est aveugle et en vain
Je me tue ? t'expliquer que ma cible n'est pas mon prochain
J'aime le hip hop, comme un jeune blanc de 15 ans
J'aime pr?cher les bonnes paroles, comme un vieux griot de 50 ans
La vie est la m?me est pour tous, parsem?e de secousses
Dur est celui qui est s?r de ne jamais avoir la frousse
J'ai peur du blanc facho, d'un noir extr?miste,
D'un blanc ultra-violent ou d'un noir non pacifique.
C'est triste de voir que nos enfants poussent avec tr?s peu de choix.
Si la voie du seigneur est sacr?e, faites qu'il entende deux fois.
Alors je ne flippe pas, ne panique pas, n'encaisse pas les faux pas
C'est pas un jeu o? la jouissance c'est vendre 
Des disques sans comprendre pourquoi.
?tre constant puis ?tre conscient, 
Ne pas ?tre un con sans vibrations et se dire hip hop ? 100%
Et puis faire du vent.
Mon but : envahir le march? sans faire de concessions.
Ici, il n'y a pas de cons qui donnent leurs fesses
Et plus tard font des concessions.
Je vis avec des noirs, trippe avec des blancs.
Rappe avec des noir blanc, peut faire des... blancs
Sans faire couler de sang, je vis en France.
Le pays o? tout le monde se plaint,
O? c'est plus facile de se cracher dessus que de tendre la main.
Rien ne sert de pleurer comme une femme bo.
Le genre de keum qui n'as pas la BO et m?rite le KO.
Le hip hop s'accro?t de jours en jours 
Constate l'?volution et sans r?volution.
J'y verrais pas de r?solution.
Et puis merde donc rien ? foutre si ?a choque.
Censurer me bloque.
Je ne rapperai que pour les miens et pour moi.
Le hip hop et puis le reste, je FFF...
400 ans d'esclavage ?a fait mal.
Racine je l'ai vu, mais aujourd'hui
Kunta Kinte aurait que la couleur dans ma rue.
Je suis un n?g', un m?tis d'une vraie culture viol?e 
D?racin?e par des colons mais reste fier de mon ?le ? jamais soud?e.
Puis sache que le pe-ra en France n'appartient ? personne.
Mon nom c'est Eben et sache que j'ai des comptes ? rendre ? personne.
Dans cette prison, la seule cl? pour pouvoir s'en sortir.
C'est de s'unir, s'investir, faire du bien pour ?viter le pire.
11 ans d?j? que je rappe et toujours pas millionnaire.
Toujours aucune voiture et aucun pav' en C?te d'Azur, fr?re.
Conscient qu'? chaque fois qu'un fr?re perce, il perce un trou en face,
Une place suffisante pour qu'un autre MC vienne reprendre sa place.

Que Faire 
Il me racontait qu'il voulait s?loigner, quil d?sirait fuir 
Ses parents, ce monde qui ne le comprenait pas, oui il songeait ? partir. 
Mon ami ?tait prisonnier de son esprit, une autre chose en t?te, 
A quelque chose, un adolescent incompris. 
Son p?re ?tait souvent la cause de ses soucis. 
Il n'appr?ciait pas que son unique enfant choisisse la musique comme hobby. 
Et si je te dis qu'il le traquait tous les soirs,
Pour qu'il ne prenne pas le chemin des MC des ?tangs noirs. 
Malheureusement, de plus, ayant une forte personnalit?, 
Et n'aimant pas trop les chuts.
Il se pressait de rentrer dans sa chambre et travailler avec acharnement.
La musique et l'?cole, de temps en temps. 
Seigneur pardonne le, mais ces liens l'?treignent. 
Crois moi il ne fait pas semblant. 
J'en ai encore les larmes aux yeux car je le comprends. 
Mon jumeau dit, et calmement je le comprends.
Quand une m?re meurt il ne reste plus de parents 
Mais qu'est-ce qui se passe quand le p?re amadoue lenfant? 
D?s son plus jeune ?ge il devient compl?tement cr?dule. 
C'est un fils crapuleux, cest un fils de crapule. 
Apr?s quinze autres ann?es, il voulut reprendre le flambeau, 
Croyant que des enfants s'?l?vent comme on ?l?ve les chameaux.
Chaque jour il lui cause des irritations
En lui disant qu'avec ses sorties abusives, il suit le chemin du d?mon. 
L'enfant se pose des questions. Est-il victime dune trahison ? 
Coup sur coup il re?oit des putains de coups de pression! 
Son seul refuge est dans la pri?re. 
Il implore Jack, car c'est lui son seul p?re. 
Alors il s'abstient et ne dialogue plus,
Il est dans l'impasse il ne retrouve plus sa rue. 
Incompr?hension entre ses parents et ses fr?res, 
Il ne sait que faire, il ne sait que faire. 
Refrain
Que faire, quand on est satur? par son p?re et sa m?re ?
Il ne sait que faire.
Que faire, quand on pense que nos parents nous veulent que mis?re ?
Il ne sait que faire.
Que faire, quand on est satur? par son p?re et sa m?re ?
Il ne sait que faire.
Mais dis moi que faire, quand on pense que nos parents nous veulent que mis?re ?
Renferm? sur lui-m?me, mais quand m?me confiant. 
Il souffrait derri?re nous et souriait devant. 
Ne plus parler ? la maison ?tait peut-?tre la solution. 
Vivre avec al?natique n'a pas ?t? sa formation.
Son nom, son don donnait-il ? Dieu, se dirigeait vers la chanson, 
Le R-A-P comme le temps d'un nom. 
Il est semblable ? la majorit? des p?res africains. 
La religion dans sa famille dominait le terrain. 
Bien, au point d'?tre enti?rement t?l?gid? par le Tout-puissant. 
La passion remporte parfois sur la raison, 
Entends tu, seulement ce rythme fr?n?tique implicite ? 100% 
Mais pourquoi lui ? Pourquoi lui ? et pourtant.
En ayant connu tant de femmes et commis tant d'adult?res, 
Ce qui valut un divorce entre son p?re et sa m?re. 
Maintenant tous les dimanches ? l'?glise il veut ?tre pasteur. 
Pardonner tous ses p?chers, il prie donc avec ardeur.
Mais les reproches de mon pote ne sont pas l?,
Ce qu'il lui r?primande, cest quil ?vite les d?bats. 
Il joue ? cache-cache, il se cache derri?re sa bible.
Lecture finie, son fils devient sa premi?re cible. 
Comme quand on c?ble des c?bles, prise de t?te, 
Il l'accable tellement accabl? quil ne mange m?me plus ? table. 
Famille ne marche pas. L'?cole ne marche pas. 
Il ne sait que faire.
Il se peura car il va plus loin que ces vers.

Mystik
Le Hip hop est un temple et les piliers se multiplient
Les plis sur les visages, les messages ont chang?
Depuis la nuit des temps, on sait que la vie n'fait pas de cadeau
Les ennuis, les chagrins chargent le poids du fardeau
?ternel cr?puscule, y a-t-il alternative ? la r?vo
Allez, vaut mieux faire mes affaires en silence, gardez vos bravos
Je ne suis pas venu en touriste ici
J'?corche les joues en attendant la sortie
Faut pas que j'assiste, j'insiste, j'incite ? la gruge
Evite les transfuges, fait ton beurre et fout le camp 
Ram?ne les r?coltes ? la grange
Tes parents t'ont donn? une chance fais pas le con
Si tu nous aimes pas fleurissent comme les fleurs dans le balcon
D'en-face pour le voisin d'en face t'es qu'une sale race
T'ebruitent, tes odeurs embarassent
Celle-ci est connue aussi connue que les conneries de Coluche 
Fa?on rap cocluche, moi je pr?f?re Jean-Miche Cramme et Grand
Il faut qu'on calme nos coeurs agit?s pour b?tir
et fuir les photos, fermer les portes perc?es que les vents p?n?trent
Dire aux autres o? se trouve les terrains mouvants, Ngue, ngue
Et tu sais quoi, je m'en fous de ton mouvement
Je suis pas un touriste, je suis venu chercher de la maille
Pout l'instant dalle que, s'il faut faire la queue, il y a ma queue dans la liste
Je cherche la bonne chaussure pour mes pieds
Si j'avais ta face ? la place de mes fesses, j'aurais honte de chier
Refrain

Qu'est-ce qu'elle a ma gueule est-ce qu'elle est saoule
Toi si tu me saoules, l? je vais mettre la cagoule

Qu'est-ce qu'elle a ma gueule est-ce qu'elle est saoule
Toi si tu me saoules, l? je vais mettre la cagoule
Sache qu'ici-bas, rien n'est certain
Et j'ferme pas ma gueule, je continue ? lever le poing

Mais qu'est-ce qu'elle a ma gueule, 
Ta gueule, si tu te fous de ma gueule
A dix ou tout seul tu prendras mon poing dans ta gueule
Ma gueule, elle est ronde et m?me si je r?de la nuit
Les ennuis, je m'y appuie, tout ?a pour sortir de ce puits
Et puis quand n trouve pas de taf' dans nos caves
On taffe sur des objets bizzares aux odeurs bizarres
A?e, a?e, a?e, ta bataille sera dure mais wala?
Je foutrai la pagaille comme le veau d'or sur le mont Sina?
Mes mots sont des cartouches et moi un carlouche
Louche comme en prison un savon ? terre pendant la douche
Couche toi par terre, ? terre ma mater m'a pas mis au monde 
Pour que je sature sur cette putain de terre
Tu penses que ma peine a maigri 
Depuis que le Pen s'est s?par? de Megret
Certains semblent moins aigris
Mais y?gri reste ma t?te, trouver un appart' un casse-t?te
Vu mon nom les proprios ne veulent pas me voir en t?te-?-t?te
Alors ? la t?te d'un empire, t'imagine leur t?te
Mais leur sein sillicon? ils veulent bien que je les t?te
Comme Bernie, je ne suis pas le bonvoisin de l'?lys?e
Avis? je le suis, donc ? moi de savoir comment l'?riger

Sentinelle, dans ce trip, je le jure sur la prunelle de mes yeux
On verra le bout du tunnel, on caressera les cieux
On fera de l'ombre ? la lune avec nos raps eclipses
Nos sombres hymnes nocturnes, chez nous y'a pas de bloods et Crips
Je ressens pas la mis?re, ils disent
Leur m?re, je suis le fils ? mon p?re et je braque leur putain de biz
Je suis un flingue sur le front ? Marianne, un effront? de n?gre au front
Constituons nos maigres chances, on s'essuie l'affront
Merde ? la Gaule et ? ces avenues
Je hais cette balafre sur la face de mon sauss'
?a me rappelle que je suis le bienvenu
Je rime cruel jusqu'? la moelle, 
Nique leur th?orie de Rockwell et ce con ? Roswell
C'est nous les vrais putains d'envahisseurs, la race la plus ha?e
On va pas se laisser tha?r comme nos pr?decesseurs
La rage m'assaille, qu'on se bouffe et c'est ce qu'ils veulent
Mais qu'est-ce qu'elle a ma gueule
Ce rap ne sera peut-?tre pas un single
Mais si c'est pour notre honneur sali, 
Pour la m?moire des Makom?, des Ibrakim Ali
Mon putain de kick sur leurs narines les fait saigner du pif
Je suis une enfoir?e de panth?re noire, fais gaffe ? mes griffes tu sais

Rien Ne Change 
Trop de v?rit? mon rap choque, aujourd'hui paye un peu.
Au micro je fais ce que j'aime, pour vivre je fais ce que je peux.
J'ai toujours aim-f, j'affronte les nouvelles ?tapes de la vie.
Je veux ?tre un exemple pour ma descendance et ma famille.
Rap-star du quartier avec un compte en banque vide,
? ?couter les autres, j'ai r?ussi, c'est clair et limpide.
Tu as foi en moi donc je place en toi mon respect,
?coute, c'est pour des gars comme toi que je rappe la v?rit? vraie.
Je dois pas faiblir ou faillir, je me dois de r?ussir,
Vivre le sourire aux l?vres, ne plus laisser mes proches souffrir.
Je donne la v?rit? sur moi, sur ma vie:
Sinc?rit?, franchise, les faux sentiments sont bannis.
J'?cris mon histoire, grave ma vie sur vinyle:
Musique, rime, vie, r?alit? sinc?re, rien de futile.
Voil? ce que je suis, ce que je fais, rien de plus, rien de moins.
Je ne dors plus, j'?cris mes textes pour aller plus loin.
Refrain
R?ve gris, pour moi rien ne change.
Ma vie est la m?me, ici pour moi rien ne change.
Tes yeux te trompent, pour moi rien ne change.
Rien ne change, rien ne change, pour moi rien ne change.
Je crois encore au pe-ra. Eben ne veut pas baisser les bras.
J'?vite tous les coups bas m?me si la jalousie ne s'arr?te pas.
Merde, je veux que mes fr?res soient fiers de moi.
Je veux r?ussir ma vie, faire plaisir ? ma m?re, et ?tre quelqu'un
Et qu'elle ne se fasse plus de souci.
Au fond quoi de plus normal que de combattre les anomalies,
Si la vie est sale, ?a veut pas dire que c'est moi qui la salis,
En plus le fait d'avoir vendu des skeuds, on cro?t que je suis riche,
Que je roule sur l'or, que j'ai de l'argent, qu'avec mes potes, je triche.
C'est faux. Et pour certains, le jeu se r?sume ? se faire de l'oseille.
Le rap fabrique ses cercueils,
Vu qu'il y a des trous dans des cervelles.
Non plus le temps aux squats, parcs, sacs remplis de packs
O? tout le monde parle de cul, de chatte ou de la mort de Tupac.
D'autres choses ? penser:
Une fille, maintenant je suis p?re, mon fils,
Les ann?es passent, elle grandit, mon p?re, faut que je r?ussisse.
? chacun sa merde, gal?re, probl?mes de coups durs.
Les miens sont si ?normes que je pense ? moi et ? mon ?criture.
Refrain
Ce que tu imagines de moi n'est pas forc?ment ce que je suis.
Ma vie n'est pas un clip ou diff?rente de celle d'autrui.
J'incarne la r?ussite au sein de mon quartier,
Mais, qui sait vraiment, qui voit vraiment ce que je vis, ce que je fais,
Oublie tes fausses id?es de champagne, caviar et de gros francs.
J'ai pas de caisse, je reviens toujours du Leader Price en marchant,
Le r?ve est loin d'?tre rose, fr?re, c'est ma r?alit?.
C'est Niro, chaque jour, je taffe et tente d'avancer.
Je r?ve peu, puis prie Dieu, vis le pire et, dans mon cauchemar, attends le mieux.
Et pour ceux qui pensent ? ma place, vivent ? ma place,
?crivent ? ma place, niquent ? ma place, qui rappent ? ma place.
Kid, j'ai les poches vides, d??ois, proches avides de r?ves,
Coche "lucide", de magasines trop stupides !
Je vis en faisant r?ver l'envie et vit le hip hop, une survie.
Rien ne change dans mon ?crit.

Du pointeur au kidnappeur
O? l'assassin ne sait m?me pas pourquoi il refroidit
Ta liste de mauvais plan, elle s'agrandit
Mais le plus grand risque c'est qu'? ta sortie
T'en gardes  le souvenir d'une vie paisible et sans souci
Car si tu rechutes ils gagneront leur pari
Refrain (x2)
On abolit la peine de mort
Par souci de bonne conscience mais la pire des sentences
Reste qu'on ne d?molit pas les remords
Dans ta vie pleine d'ennuis tu m?dites sur ton sort
Tu v?g?tes sur ton lit comme le fruit qui m?rit petit ? petit
Trop tu pourris, tu choisis de faire le tour de tes souvenirs
Mieux vaut qu'esp?rer s'en sortir
Ta joie de vivre aujourd'hui, ces rares lettres manuscrties
Et peu de visites, avoue qu'tu cogites
Via la prison sortiront des amis d'?lite
Terrass?s par cette v?rit?. Une relation privil?gi?e liera les rescap?s
La tornade est pass?e. Le bateau a coul?.
On r?embarque ceux qui restent ? c?t?
Famille, amis dans la m?me gal?re
On sait pourtant qu'il n'y a rien ? faire
La terre tourne toujours regarde par la fen?tre

This is it; freestyle hip hop. 
I'm a freak soon as the beat drops. 
Grab the mike and start the rhyme. 
Yo, I'm working overtime. 
To get you sweatin' on the floor. 
Until you can't take no more. 
As I remeness, you can guess the rest. 
Yes, I'm the best of my class! 
5, 4, 3, 2, 1. 
Now it's time to have fun. 
Get out there and do your thing. 
Boys and girls let me see you swing. 
Move your body to this smooth caper. 
Don't stand there like you was wallpaper 
I'm a freak but I excel. 
And I just can't help myself. 
I'm not a freak, but I can't help myself 
I'm not a freak, but I can't help myself 
Yes, here we go again. 
Now I'm the artist and you're the fan. 
Funky lyrics for funky minds. 
Check your swatch if you don't know the time. 
House and rap: a perfect combination. 
This is real no imitation. 
Party people, are you ready to dance? 
Well come on, here is your change. 
Like a diplomat I like to make contact. 
All the cuties- I keep 'em in check. 
With the smooth raps, the good groove. 
Now is the time so get loose. 
Bass is pumpin', I feel good. 
Now get jumpin' like you never knew you could. 
Da Baron MC was the one who did it. 
1, 2, 3 hit it. 
Kickin' the bass- I like it deep. 
I work nighttimes, I don't sleep. 
Strive to be the best I can. 
Don't judge a person 'til you now the man.

And the Baron MC got rhymes galore. 
I don't play, I ain't no toy. 
And that's because I said so boy. 
The work is done the money in the pocket. 
I heard the jam and I rocked it. 
Shake that ass, go besurk. 
Don't just stand there like a jerk.

Now let me see you dance.

And I just can't help myself.

With lovely flowers around everywhere.
Come take my hand , I'll show you I'll guide you.

With smiling faces around everywhere.

If you really wanna do it, get in to it, baby move it.
Slip slide to the place, bring a happy face, bass.
Treble rebel is what I am, I boogie in the wonderland.
It's up to you to find, what you're looking for,
As I rock, rock, rock to the rhythm, I can give you more, more,
From the soul, take control, find yourself never to old.
Come, Come take my hand, and I will take you to this land.

Take a chance, to enchant, on the floor as you dance.
Come, come take my hand, travel with me to a land,
Of happiness for everyone, run, run here I come.
Pick it up, pick it up, don't be late, feel the groove don't be late,
To go inside take a ride, now you now you can't deny.
What you feel is it real, let it go and you will know,
What to do it's up to you, follow me it's nothing new.
Come, come take my hand and I will take you to this land.

To the future not to the past, 
Take it easy and not too fast. 
Many failed in society, 
To blind to see you need to be free. 
Free from the strain that causes pain, 
Pain is the name and life is the game. 
Dream on try to survive, 
Keep hope alive reach for the sky. 
Do the best you can make a wish come true, 
Listen here's the clue: Let it flow before it's all gone 
Come on boy you got to dream on. 
Try to relax and move to the track, 
Go for your goals and don't hold it back. 
Strive to keep you dreams and hopes alive, 
Do it now and don't pass it by. 
Life is to short so give me your hand 
I will lead you to another land.

Shinin' bright cause I'm right. 
Close your eyes and just concentrate, 
It's never to late to erase the hate. 
Focus your mind when I say my rhymes, 
Cause I'm always on time. 
Do the best you can make a wish come true, 
Listen here's the clue: Let it flow before it's all gone 
Come on boy you got to dream on 
Dreams are the way to express yourself from the heart 
Now it's time to depart.. On a journey for the mind

One day you'll see that you be

Meet who you wanted to meet
Just one day you'll see
And one day you'll see that you
Feel what you wanted to feel
Meet who you wanted to see
Just one day you're free
Once again it's the R.O.C.K.
So check what I gotta say
As we go my way
Get ready for a journey an expedition
Just listen or you will be missin'
A lot of times I know you feel like giving up
But listen up everybody while you move that body
I got a story to tell so listen well
Only you can be you when it's time to excel
Many might try but you don't know the reason why
They might deny they don't want you to fly
So you gotta move on and show 'em
You got it goin' on and on plus your mind is strong
Now this is how I get busy on the daily
I kept this in mind so you suckers can't fake me
Rise and surprise everybody like me
Cause one day you will see you will be how you wanna be
Repeat Chorus
I remember days when people used to say
Stop wasting time and find another way
They never understood no they never took time
That the R.O.C.K. was born for the rhymes
I kept my mind focused and I went for my direction
Microphone checkin' was my only selection
My eyes on the prise I was on the rise
Everytime you see me now you wanna say hi
You don't even know who I am
So take all your plans and scram
You don't understand

Remembering how it used to be
We were happy but we could not see
That life has changed and all the funny things
Are blown away with your diamond rings
Money has caught you in
A prison of a loving thing
The twinkle in your eyes is gone
The money that has made you wrong
Discontent with only love
And happy with your dirty stuff
Smile, if you want me back,
Baby, smile stay on this track.
Smile if you want me back,

I Never met a woman like you
Now the skies are all ways blue
When you're gone I wish you ware back
Smiling, stay on this this track
Yesterdays we just talk all night
We were happy everything was right
But now you're changed
Don't listen anymore
There's only one thing were you're livin' for

1000 Parole 
Vorrei mandarti via dai miei pensieri,
sei nella testa mia oggi come ieri,
vorrei mandarti via poi mi appari,
spunti fuori, sono giorni in cui mi oscuri,
erano soli,
noi soli in una stanza, il mondo aspetta fuori,
buoni motivi ne ho abbastanza, svari
dove sono i miei pensieri buoni?
Ora, spesso e volentieri sono lampi e tuoni,
una macchina, un cancello da non vedere,
una strada da non fare, un locale da evitare in certe sere,
non chiedermi come posso stare ora,
vorrei la forza per riuscirti ad odiare,
mille parole,
tanto c'? un muro da sfondare quindi ? meglio agire,
vorrei mandarti via ma ti continuo a cercare,
forse masochismo forse amore,
una parola assai difficile da pronunciare ma ora fa male...
Sei nella testa mia, sei nella testa mia,
sei nella testa mia, sei nella testa mia,
sei nella testa mia, sei nella testa mia,
vorrei mandarti via, mandarti via...
L'altra sera ti ho vista passare,
andavi svelta per non farti vedere,
in quel momento stavo per scoppiare, volevo
bere per scappare ma non potevo, non sapevo come uscire da quell'incubo,
stavo l? fermo, distante anni luce dalla gente intorno,
in fondo era l? ad un palmo,
calmo all'esterno, dentro di me un inferno,
stavo tremando come mai prima,
non c'era sangue ma sentivo una lama,
perch? non hai risposto al mio messaggio?
Perch? la mia testa ti ? rimasta in ostaggio?
Ora non c'? pi? alternativa provo a farmi coraggio,
obiettivo star bene rischiando di star peggio,
rischiando di star peggio ti chiamo:
"Ciao, come stai? Perch? non ci vediamo?
Dai, diamoci una punta, ancora ti amo lo sai"
Non ho mai smesso,
ormai per troppo ho provato ad ingannare me stesso.
Il peggio arriva adesso ma non mollo,
ci sto dentro fino al collo, fammi un cenno, dai... fallo,
sto fuori di senno, non lo so, 
ma non accanno, io, nella realt? infame di questo giorno...
Sei nella testa mia, sei nella testa mia,
sei nella testa mia, sei nella testa mia,
sei nella testa mia, sei nella testa mia,
vorrei mandarti via, mandarti via...
Io e te davanti, come al telefono lunghi silenzi,
stavi bene ma non basta mo non stai bene ma ti accontenti,
pi? che parole montanti sul mio viso per? sei tu che piangi,
di nuovo tu che piangi,
ormai ? tardi non capisco, non ci credo,
mi guardo intorno e vedo solamente il vuoto,
? un nodo che non si scioglie,
vorrei vederlo il difficile di scegliere,
tranquilla,
io non cercavo una moglie...
cercavo un viso da far sorridere,
un corpo da scaldare,
una fusione d'anime,
ma sono parole al vento, contale,
non sono le ultime, ricordale,
vorrei mandarti via ma non ? facile,
ricorda che se hai pi? paura di abbatere,
questo dipende dal tuo modo di vivere,
sto mondo non perdona chi non ci sa convivere,
anime libere per caso sono pronte a finire in cenere...
Sei nella testa mia, sei nella testa mia,
sei nella testa mia, sei nella testa mia,
sei nella testa mia, sei nella testa mia,
vorrei mandarti via, mandarti via...
Sei nella testa mia, sei nella testa mia,
sei nella testa mia, sei nella testa mia,
sei nella testa mia, sei nella testa mia,
vorrei mandarti via, mandarti via...
Parole al vento...
agiremo contro...
Freddo qua dentro, freddo che sento,
resteranno parole al vento...

Cinico mi esplicito 
rimango di ghiaccio
anche se vedo gente che vive nel fango
piango se mi manca all'improvviso il materiale
mentre c'? chi nasce e muore dentro un ospedale
vale la pena rischiare se posso comprare
un paio di scarpe nuove e non ho da mangiare
dare per scontato tutto questo non ? il caso
qui c'? puzza di gente che ha la puzza sotto il naso
penso solo a me stesso egoista e cinico
ormai ho perso il senso civico e del resto
c'? poco che commuove la platea nel colosseo
comunista ebreo nazista

vorrei vedere perch? non dovrei ridere
quando ci sta chi per decidere arriva ad uccidere
con nessuno al mondo niente voglio dividere
dividere niente voglio dividere

Pace dei sensi e soprattutto del cervello, e non ci credo che ora mi vuoi bene come un freatello...

Dove Sta Scritto 
Piu' volte:
E dimmelo tu dove sta scritto...
Posto il margine fra le pagine l'indagine
resta ancora aperta se la tua offerta ? l'immagine
di un posto fatto di persone buone e simpatiche
meglio selvaggi a pezzi con le pezze sulle natiche
con un cuore e una testa che agiscono in simbiosi
vengono alla nostra festa, spariscono invidiosi,
fanno i preziosi ma sono curiosi, troppo orgogliosi
per ammettere a se stessi che sono gelosi
non so di cosa perch? non ? che abbiamo molto
stare al fresco che gli diamo se si mettono all'ascolto
voglia di stare in pace questo qua ? il segreto
faccio come me pare, con voi non competo.
Dimmelo tu dove sta scritto,
che devo rispettarti solo perch? riesci a pagarti l'affitto
fatti un bel viaggio al mare con la tua familiare
ti prego quest'estate devi lasciarmi respirare
troppo impicciato per costruire castelli di sabbia
mi chiedo dove andr? a finire tutte questa rabbia
sar? soltanto uno dei tanti trip andati storti
soltanto uno dei tanti pesi che ancora sopporti.

debba per forza seguire le tue regole
vado avanti e continuo

mentre qui sta sorgendo un nuovo sole altro giro altra corsa, belle parole

va bene, ma chi l'ha detto che per questo tutto il resto debba lasciare
mo fammi un favore non dare sempre tutto troppo per scontato,
signore puoi non ascoltare ma non puoi cancellare qualcosa se un qualcosa c'? stato
ultimo stadio ricerca di un rimedio a sguardi delusi, volti confusi
amore no odio questo ? per la gente che mi porta sorrisi

futuro zero per loro e non solo merda che piove dal cielo

problemi che iniziano la testa manifesta una richiesta d'ossigeno.
Specchi in cui se ti specchi vedi pi? lontano
per farlo basta solo alzarti da quel divano

attesa, rottura di questa corda troppo tesa
accesa fiamma nel corpo alimentata dall'offesa.
Io so da me, tu sai da te com'? attualmente quindi
non dirmi niente ogni azione mo parla chiaramente
ogni azione mo parla chiaramente in maniera pi? esauriente.

dove si va stasera chiedo a Eros e Sparo Manero
ma niente romane, qui solo budini, burattini, burini poco nero e poco dinero
voglio un aereo per Rio de Janeiro
Samba non bamba, ganja ho deja vu da straniero
zero deliri in euro
? inutile che mi estraneo mi becco con qualche conterraneo mediterraneo
(Rome Zoo) stilo contemporaneo
niente posti da vip, meglio star nascosti da chi ha trick che ci fanno strano
resto in piazza si smazza io c'ho uno che ha un fumo che ammazza,
si ma che passa da adesso a quando si collassa
(io non lo so, fai te)
Franc?? (che c'??)
bella frat? ce l'hai pe me? falla
Rizla man ti? rolla

ogni stratage da qui mo sfolla
stasera che c'?? risposta nulla
solita rutine che spunta e a farla sar? una birra pi? una giunta culi 
di pietra e pietra unta,
famo sta conta dai butta
chi scaglia lo pulisce nun se scappa bis, 
n'altra boccia dai stappa (segna)
non sar? una serata brutta lo so
chi se la vedr? a male sar? la faccia che torner? a casa sfatta m?,

Le mille e una notte, le mille e una canna
basta cambiare programma che ce le hai rotte
le crude e le cotte, le cotte e le lunghe
ci vuol qualcuno che aggiunge e che non ci fotte
Le mille e una notte, le mille e una maffie(?)
Maurizio alla base che sveglia e che scuote
chi squaglia e chi incolla
chi molla una paglia
Rome Zoo, Gente Guasta e Next Level, il meglio in Italia
Rime come concime, rime continue
per noi fumatori integratori vitamine
vibrazioni, linee di basso al passo
sensazioni senza fine e situazioni da collasso
passa le cartine le farcisco, zero rischio
non mischio l'erba con il muschio,
fammi un fischio, 
non c'? inganno non c'? trucco fisico asciutto
non fare un dramma se sta canna me la stucco
le mille e una notte, questa notte nuove rotte
assurda serata che assorbe come uno scottex
chi se ne fotte, anche stavolta ? andata
Roma Zoo pi? Gente Guasta ennesima mandata
Si, si
questa notte scatta la chiusa, blindo tutte le finestre
qui se ne abusa fino a far star fatto Dj Fester
di fumo passivo
in T-shirt da clima estivo, termosifoni a palla
carta dove qualche rima scrivo tra una canna e l'altra - estro creativo
e ci sta chi se le stucca - gesto negativo
zitto, zitto ti sei mangiato il pollo fritto
ma che te la devi spegne dimmelo tu dove sta scritto?
suona il citofono, chi ?? i solidi sospetti
falli salire che quelli ne portano a mezz'etti
aspettiamo di svenire prima di dire basta
integralisti religiosi fanatici hip hop rasta

*scratches*
Muoviamo il culo da qui
damoce, infiliamoce
nella metropoli usiamo i sensi, 
fidamoce dei nostri mezzi
li conquistiamo li sblastiamo confondiamo i nostri piani o stiamo bene dove stiamo
chiaro, le chiavi in mano
il mondo ai nostri piedi e noi chi siamo 
Roma Zoo + Gente Guasta da Milano con lo zaino
El pResidente in una forma smagliante
Next One, colonna sonora che gira come le sue gambe
tocca fare tutto ai mezzi con questi prezzi al giro
confondiamo le nostre menti ogni respiro un tiro
questo ? rap solo rap ma tu non sai giocarci
siamo ballerini e siamo in ballo per sballarci
Passa il tempo, ma il passatempo rimane identico
passala che me la stendo fino a zero ossigeno svengo
l'ennesima discaja, 
con l'accendino stappo l'ennesima bottiglia ascolto il mare nella mia conchiglia
dovunque andiamo c'? la stessa situazione,
mai sazio squajo un altro pezzo e con la testa spazio verso un'altra dimensione
seguo nuovi stimoli, e gli occhi crepati non sono altro che i primi sintomi
sintonizzati che ci si stona, a casa si fuma e si parla
nei locali ci si sballa e ce se scalla fino all'alba fino al coma
e mentre Roma dorme la bia banda se la suona in zona

Lettera A Un Amico 
E' solo per te che scrivo questa impressa in testa
la foto di un sorriso che resta nel tempo anche se il tempo passa
la tua gente sulla pelle, non follla in cui credere
basta polvere per vivere dimmi che ci sei ancora
dimmi che non ? ancora l'ora (paura)
si, lo so la vita ? dura
tanto infame quanto cara niente dura in eterno
spesso il tempo vola e a far cambiare aria basta una parola sola
la testa parte per strani viaggi, dove sei mo? (dove sei mo?!!)
per te resta un posto nel cuore dei selvaggi per strada solo stracci,
giorni, notti, pomeriggi grigi in mezzo a ostaggi
droga di ieri strade di oggi, strade a pezzi
vorrei vederti solo stare bene, torna da 'sti pizzi
? un mondo de pazzi ? vero
ma pi? che soluzioni stai cercando un fuggi fuggi, sia chiaro
Rit.:
Non vengo qua per farti una lezione (no, no!)
viviamo entrambi in questo mondo infame (si, si!)
non voglio importi nessuna condizione (capisci?!)
vorrei soltanto stare bene.
Non vengo qua per farti una lezione (no, no!)
viviamo entrambi in questo mondo infame (? cos?)
non voglio importi nessuna condizione (io)
voglio soltanto...
Sar? difficile ingannarmi
se saranno i tuoi occhi a parlarmi,
vuoto nel vuoto che dentro non potr? mai colmarmi
darmi un minuto, forse, la tua salvezza
non vengo qua per farti una lezione ma apprezza
non sei fatto come loro (no, no,no, no)
siete diversi (se, se,se, se)
non sei fatto come loro (no, no,no, no)
siete diversi, non fa per te quel lavoro.
Sei come un gioiello perso tra l'immondizia
cuore di un pischello in ostaggio di chi sevizia
vizia sempre e soltanto la parte pi? debole
non avrai mai un riscatto se qui non c'? colpevole
vorrei soltanto averti accanto
oggi come ieri cercando la pace senza il rimpianto
tanto ? il rispetto che per te provano
suonano allarmi quando a volte non ti trovano
sei un ingranaggio troppo importante in questo motore
? silenzio nelle strade dove portavi il rumore.
Rit.
Forse finir? cos?: parole al vento
crederci per?: non intendo
? un no che spingo anche se mo se l'aspetto
su quel pavimento col freddo del niente intorno
la forza che hai dentro non scordarla attento
attendo il ritorno del sorriso su quel viso che vedo
segnato da un peso vorrei per te solo giorni pi? gaggi
la mia voce per portarti il pensiero dei ragazzi selvaggi
No, no, non scordarla mai,
la forza che ? in te non scordarla mai
Stanno aspettando il tuo ritorno puoi sentirli
e anche se stai l? a subirli non puoi contraddirli
hanno miliardi di buoni motivi per provarci
anche se sar? pesante quel giorno tu dovrai starci
strillano il tuo nome per sentirti pi? vicino
se pu? servirti sappi che non sarai solo nel cammino

Pagine Vuote 
O, che succede?
qualcuno non sorride pi?..?
qui non ci si crede!
Era, un giorno come tanti all'apparenza poi
mille pensieri in testa non darmi
abbastanza tranquillit? per concentrarmi
assenza di calma provo a rilassarmi ma non c'? pace in questa stanza
esco per distrarmi ma c'? distanza fra me ed ogni situazione
giro senza destinazione la testa viaggia cercando una soluzione
oggi sta in vacanza la parola "ragione"
la faccia nello specchio non ? pi? la mia
una citazione che pu? rendere l'idea
fumo ma la situazione non ? questa
pensavo de sta a famme invece ? solamente mal di testa
pensavo de sta fatto invece ? solamente mal di testa
maestro, nella tua orchestra stona un musicista
il telefono non squilla bevo una birra
ma sollevarmi da terra non baster? a quella
domani ? un altro giorno e meno male
passer? ma stanotte qua non dovevo restare
capisci? non dovevo venire.
intanto aspetto
cercando di capire come andr? a finire!
Rit. (2 volte):
Yo, che succede?
qualcuno non sorride pi?..?
qui non ci si crede!
Pagine vuote del mio book difficile riempirle
se ti avvicini un p? di pi? forse potrai sentirle
anime in pena che si sfidano dentro l'arena
il premio in palio ? il pass per una vita pi? serena
facile uscirne quanto ? facile infognarsi
quanto ? difficile cadere e poi rialzarsi
vivere in bilico sull'orlo del bracere
toccare il fondo dentro il fondo di un bicchiere
scendo in apnea e stavolta ci rimango
in superficie ? gi? da un p? che sta piovendo fango
sbando non rispondo pi? al loro comando
tra me e il loro commando il vuoto si sta colmando
contando su quello a cui sto optando
bloccando l'attrito i conti stanno tornando
eliminando parassiti dalle nostre radici
sono di qualit? scadente le vostre vernici
segni sul cemento cancellati dal vento
se non c'? un equilibrio fra ogni singolo elemento
l'allenamento non sempre potr? aiutarti
se saranno scarti quello che potranno darti.
Rit.
Pessimi esempi quelli che mi hanno dato fino adesso
pensando che per star bene debba vivere all'eccesso
divieto d'accesso per chi mi ha messo
queste storie in testa senza chiedermi il permesso
messo da parte l'odio per chi l'ha promesso
intanto resta un dubbio: l'impianto ? stato manomesso
in caso d'incendio nessuno potr? salvarsi
se saranno gli esperti del posto i primi a darsi
Torna la calma dopo il "nessun dorma"
qualcosa cambia o forse sono io che ho visto un dramma
inesistente un film che non corrisponde
polvere che confonde l'occhio provocando facce spente
portami via di qui ora
tornero' stasera per trovarci di nuovo di fronte
e sar? storia
tienilo in memoria
non sar? venire per gloria
tienilo in memoria.

Paure 
(feat. Masito)
A volte paura di te stesso
a volte paura del resto
poi sembra che tutto torni a posto
tutto resta impresso
de niente me stupisco
Tutto questo quando
speri soltanto di arrivare a casa e farti un personal
correndo, fuggendo, fingendo che tutto sia tranquo
qualcuno mi parla ma non rispondo
bevo ma non brindo intorno intanto tutto sembra finto, io
spinto fuori da qui alla prossima scendo
ogni minuto secondo li conto, ricordi? abbiamo un appuntamento
com'? che ieri in questa testa non c'eri
gioie e dolori svari strani pensieri
puntuali come al solito coloro vecchi compari
Ninna canna buonanotte e a domani
se magari
non si spengono i fari
segnali di fumo l? fuori
il grande capo ha stabilito dei giorni ancora duri
tempi, meglio che siano tempi brevi
ne faccio un'altra co' gli occhi mezzi chiusi e pensieri pi? buoni
tanto pochi quanto opportuni
ti allontani ed io
chiudo gli occhi mentre mi abbandoni.
Rit. (2 volte):
Persone perse fra s? e il forse
un equilibrio che si rompe
una luce che si accende e poi niente
qui non c'? pace e sta suonando un'allarme
La vedo negli occhi della gente ma nulla ? per sempre
neanche le paure che hai in mente
2 buoni motivi pi? colle der fomento
figli di questo tempo
ora che stanno partendo
vedo negli occhi dela gente
ma nulla ? per sempre
neanche i limiti della tua mente
arriva un giorno in cui cominci da capo
sei tu lo schiavo, quello che aspettavamo
Devo fargliela vedere
pensi a cosa devi fare
si, ma sei schiacciato a terra dalle tue paure
non ti ? bastata vita dura e nocche dure
per capire come ti devi salvare in mezzo a questo mare che devo affrontare
sono dentro a un viaggio mentale, materiale
naturale come quello che faccio
cerca la pace nelle cose che fai
cercala nel fare e la troverai.
Antidolorifici spray
gente, gente prova di tutto senza scegliere niente
protegge il culo ma non salva la mente
non sa quello che trover?, sa quello che perde
non si sente pi? un uomo quando si ritrova al verde
verme che striscia schiacciato a terra dalle sue paure
e ognuno di noi che passa ore dure cerca cure
ci si aggrappa a qualcosa che ci salva,
qualcosa che ci cambia ma nessuno pi? parla.
Rit.
La vedo negli occhi della gente ma nulla ? per sempre

2 buoni motivi pi? colle der fomento
figli di questo tempo
ora che...
Un campanello che squilla,
una faccia da gorilla
arriva alle mie spalle si prepara punta il pezzo e poi strilla
sul momento mi giro con lo spray ancora in mano
l'unico pensiero che ho in testa ? essere lontano
butto tutto e scappo con gli altri verso la stazione
ma siamo in troppi per andare nella stessa direzione
vorrei gi? fermarmi ma ancora ? troppo presto
seguo l'istinto che mi porta a destra insieme a Estro
passo la prima, la seconda, poi la terza con un salto
lui dietro di me come un pazzo spara colpi in alto
si, siamo fuori di l? ma ci siamo dentro fino al collo
ora pronto a fare i conti con le parole che mi accollo
a mollo dentro la merda per nasconderci
immersi nei rovi di spine per confonderci
salto nella fogna ad ogni luce come un topo
tagli e lividi che accusi solo una settimana dopo
noi pensando agli altri e a cosa gli sar? successo
forse li rivedremo solo il giorno del processo
spinto dalla strizza pi? che dal coraggio
che mi prese in ostaggio quella notte di maggio.

Un Giorno Come Tanti 
(feat. Sparo)
E' una giornata tipo raccontata in un riassunto
? il sonno che si spezza alle sei e mezza in punto
la radio-sveglia sul com? fa partire lo show
in piedi mentre in casa tutti dormono
il caff? sul fuoco e poi una doccia veloce
uno sguardo alla finestra, fuori ancora non c'? luce
? presto, buio pesto tristemente si veste velocemente
con la mente ancora a letto ma alle otto puntuale
attraverser? la citt? e sar? a lavorare
e saluta moglie e figli con un classico bacio
e in un attimo poi catapultato nel traffico
con la sua utilitaria dalla Salaria all'Aurelia
e sarebbe vita seria pensare che una volta aveva mille passioni
adesso allo sportello ascolta rompicoglioni
prima impegnato, adesso impiegato,
imprigionato, pi? di prima impicciato,
preparato ad un altro giorno di lavoro intenso,
si sente sollevato solo all'ora di pranzo...
Rit. (2 volte):
Ore sei e trenta
il sonno che si spezza
Ore tredici e trenta
la fila a mensa
Ore venti e trenta
la solita minestra
un giorno come tanti all'apparenza, poi...
La fila a mensa
il vassoio che avanza
mille sguardi a distanza,
piatti presi con noncuranza.
Solito piatto, soliti amici, solita stanza
pi? solita insofferenza, intensa,
in testa le quattro posa lo scettro e mette il cappotto
solito traffico ma a 'sto giro dice "me ne sbatto"
'na mezzoretta a leto
poi un paio d'ore con gli amici al baretto de sotto,
dai pensamo a svolt? un parcheggio che ? meglio
il volto si fa serio mentre lui gira per sbaglio
torna a casa confuso dal vuoto assurdo
moglie e figli, cane, ma lui si sente aggredito dal mondo
l'incontro e scontro "ciao cara, scendo"
testa bassa, volto spento, passo lento e via dicendo
a stento si avvicina la fine di un altro giorno
ma il vento soffia contro...
Rit.
A cena come tutte le sere tavola imbandita
famiglia unita, sposato, due figli, ma vuole farla finita
solito telegiornale, solita minestra lo assillano,
lui sta zitto e abbassa la testa
la moglie vuole i soldi per andare al parrucchiere (caro...)
lui sta perdendo la pazienza e non ne vuole pi? sapere (no)
? stressato, non ce la fa pi? e sta per crollare
si ? stancato, sta impicciato e se ne vuole andare
non ce la fa pi? ad alzarsi e guardarsi allo specchio
a non arrivare a mezzo secolo e sentrsi vecchio
da pischello era un cantante ma non ha sfondato
e ora si sente uno sfigato che fa l'impiegato
talento sprecato anche avendo sgobbato
per tutto questo tempo ancora non si ? rassegnato
reduce di una vita che lo ha messo alle strette
saluta tutti e scende a comprare le sigarette...

A Song For Darrell Abbott 
Awake in silence
So sterilize
I know it's far too soon to say good bye
But I will not worry now
No one could tear you down
Inside myself I found that you're the reason why
(Chorus)
What I wanted to confide
You're the dream that I've been chasing after
Your memory could never die
The path we walk you carved in stone
To you this life I owe
This place can keep you
But you carry on
I know it's different now that you are gone
But I will not worry now
No one could tear you down
Inside myself I found that you're the reason why
(Chorus)

The Wedding Dress 
She wore a wedding dress to the funeral
She said the dead don't rest for the beautiful
And as she pulls her groom out from the ground
They give him one last kiss before they lay him down
She wore a wedding dress to the funeral
She said the dead don't reast for the beautiful
And as she pulls her groom out from the ground
They give him one last kiss before they lay him down

A Beautiful Tragedy 
Frame another picture of this night,
as I sell myself on this dream.
I'll sleep with everything I've never had.
The silence screams out your name.
The extra wheel to your speeding car,
crashing to burn. 
We've come so far.
The two of us on different paths
finally meet the wrong way.
Sleepless nights, 
we're all for you. (all for you)
Was it worth my time 
when I spent my thoughts on you? (on you)
I need to know what you're thinking,
'cause I see you and wonder 
could we be the same?
I'm lost in movement and I don't know
which side of me to show.
the extra wheel to your speeding car,
crashing to burn. 
We've come so far.
the two of us on different paths
finally meet the wrong way.
I need to know what you're thinking,
[The extra wheel to your car.]

All is quiet on New Year's day
A world in white gets underway
And I want to be with you
Be with you night and day
Nothing changes on New Year's day
I will be with you again
I will be with you again
Under a blood-red sky
A crowd has gathered in black and white
Arms entwined, the chosen few
Newspapers say, it says it's true it's true
And we can break through
Through torn in two we can be one
I will begin again
I will begin again
Oh and maybe the time is right
Oh maybe tonight
I will be with you again
I will be with you again
And so we are told this is the golden age
And gold is the reason for the wars we wage
Though I want to be with you

The sun is always shining
For me and you
Never asking ??? together we will fly
It's time to solve this mystery
Pain, pain, crying in the rain
Everybody knows that why is not a game
So let's all change our ways together
We dream of the world
Let's keep up the faith
There's a better place for you and me
Universal love
We dream of the world
We dream of the world
Let's keep up the faith
Let's keep up the faith
There's a better place for you and me
A place for you and me
Universal love
Universal love
We dream of the world
We dream of the world
Let's keep up the faith
Let's keep up the faith
There's a better place for you and me
A place for you and me
Universal love
Universal love

2 For Good
You And Me 
We've been living together but it couldn't be forever 
Why are you leaving me this way 
I wanna give you devotion, let me feel your emotion 
Don't go away, you can make my day 
You and me, a neverending scene 
Don't wake me up, it's like a dream 
You and me, it's gonna hold the key 
We both feel to be free 
You and me (you and me) 
Who is getting hole of the key 
(You and me) We both just need to be free 
(You and me) What's a day without any fight 
(You and me) What's a night when I can't hold you tight 
Love is more than a game I feel inside 
It is burning flame, awaking my pride 
(You and me) Who is getting hole of the key 
(You and me) We both just feel to be free. 
You and me 
Your desire is fading 
I can't ..................... but waiting 
You're the only one for me 
You're my only desire, feel the heat of the fire 
'Cause I know you're the lover I need 
You and me, it's the right temptation 
Love is more than fascination 
You and me eternally, we both feel to be free

Breakdown 
Insanity breaking in 
&
 taking over 
Blacking out, 
Control is lost 
I'm not quite sober. 
Shred the trace 
Destroy the link to my face 
Designed to fail 
I incriminate myself. 
Silence outside screaming in..... 
Break down fight it again 
Right now listen my friend 
Break down this is your time 
I've found a reason to die 
Almost home pulling in 
&
 I just woke up 
Close my eyes shake this sin 
I must be drugged 
Seeing clearly for the first 
It screams as if i'd never seen reality 
Silence outside screaming in... 
Break down fight it again 
Right now listen my friend 
Break down this is your time 
I've found a reason to die 
Silence outside 
Screaming inside 
The blade lays into my skin 
I won't let it get the best of him 
Silence outside 
Screaming inside 
Just before I begin to bleed 
I then wake up it was all a dream 
I feel like i'm gonna break, 
I'm gonna break down x3
I feel like i'm gonna break

2 Left Feet
Last Regret. 
Grabbing at sunlight,
that keeps slipping away,
we caught nothing but dust
and golden shadows.
Nothing happened that night,
just the stuff you didn't want.
I still love you,
cry to sleep seeing your photo
fading away by my bedside.
I want it to be better,
to hear you're laugh again.
Want you to tremble underneath
my delicate touch.
We danced under the stars,
screamed in go carts.
That's when you disappered,
leaving me lonely and broken.
You're my last regret,
Sleeping with the guy
Made me break - down 
&
 cry.
Just my last regret.

To Die For 
Right now, 
Got things running through my mind.
All this time, It was all for
Nothing, I ever did was good enough for you 
&
 I , 
I never said that this wouldnt hurt
To say goodbye
&
 You left me there to die
By myself.
[Chorus:]
Cry yourself to sleep tonight, 
I won't be there to hold you tight.
Tonight you will dream of me 
&
 Tomorrow, You will scream for me
Right now, 
Don't know what to say 
Cause when I speak

Your Eyes 
Stop my hands from shakin 
Stop these lies from making 
me push you away. 
Summer's almost over

 We're both one year older 
What i'd give for another day 
Then it all came crashing down 
When i reach there's noone around 
It's your eyes 
&
 your smile that hurt everytime x2 
So i sit here thinking, 
On the verge of drinking 
your memory away 
Spend my time daydreaming 
The sun, the sweat, the feeling 
What i'd give for another day 
Then it all came crashing down 
When i reach there's noone around 
It's your eyes

Verse One: Brother Marquis
I bring home the bacon

But behind my back bitch
You been seen with another man
Oh I just had to shed a tear
Bitch you got to leave here
Is it me or him baby?
So long my motherfuckin' dear
Verse Two: Luke Skywalker
Come lay your black ass down
Right beside me
Hold onto my dick
While I grab a little bit of that pussy
Suck it right
Bitch suck it all night
And if you ask me to eat some pussy
I choke your black ass all night
Verse Three: Fresh Kid Ice
Since my baby left me
I been doin' well on my own
Fucked the neighbour's wife
And broke up a happy home
Now the bitch wanna live with me

Bitch if you can't fry rice
Well get your bald-head ass out tonight
Verse Four: Mr. Mixx
I met this raggedy bitch
Down on southwest eighth street
I fuck that bitch from the top of her head
To the bunyons on her motherfuckin' feet
I said Bitch as long as your pussy is
It's a goddamn sin
I gotta hold an ironing board across your chest
To keep from fallin' in

          They dropped the ban and set us free
          Lil' Joe turned us loose in the United States

          So come to the party and have no fear
          Holler at your boys, 2 Live is here!
[Marquis] Unknown whereabouts, somewhere smoked out
          Dickin' a bitch's mouth off in a trickin' house
          Ridin', lickin', peepin', blowin'
          Stop, pick up the bitch that's hoin', and keep goin'
          Marquis ain't gon' ever change

2 Live Is What We Are... (Word) 
1-2 1-2
I am the dominating Fresh Kid Ice
And I am the Brother Marquis, Marquis your brother
And introducing to you on the two turntables:
The Treach DJ Mr. Mixx
(Word)
[ VERSE 1: Brother Marquis ]
We get the red carpet treatment cause we're well respected
Always accepted and never rejected
Our defense is made when we take the stage
The crowd gets excited and goes in a rage
Cause we're generating and demonstrating
All of the talents that we're accumulating
And by doing this we'll go real far
Because - 2 Live is what we are
We're highly publicized and advertised
Our music's in your ear, our face in your eyes
We're good to go and goin to be good
We've done the right thing like you knew we would
Because we are here for your dancing pleasure
With our microphones, cause that's what we treasure
Now the man you see, who has hands of magic
His name is Mr. Mixx, so come on a scratch it
[ VERSE 2: Brother Marquis ]
You can call me Brother Marquis, Marquis your brother
The t-e-s-t I pass with with flying colors
I'm capable and on the case
Gettin straight to the point with no time to waste
The point is that this party needs to be rocked
Wioth drummin thumpin beats around the clock
>From odds to outspoken to opinionated
In need of a rhyme I will create it
The best is yet to come, with much much more
You got me rockin you with my rhymes galore
Now my rhymes won't stop, my rhymes won't quit
Just give me the mic and I rock it
On to the break of dawn
I will rock y'all to the early morn
Cause I'm the demonstrating, the dominating
Annihilator, brutalor, MC-hating
So all MC's must step on off
Cause I'm lettin you know who's the boss
Now Kid Ice, you know you're twice as nice
Why don't you get up on the mic and start to recite?
[ VERSE 3: Fresh Kid Ice ]
Cause they call me Kid Ice, the ladies' fire
When I enter a room, ladies fill we desire
Anytime I'm good, yes on the mic
I said the girls keep comin back every night
Cause I dress so fresh, my voice is clean
I can rock party people, yes even the Queen
In England, Germany, France and Japan
The ladies know that I'm the man
Who keep em from the kitchen just doin their dishes
Cause I have em in bed fulfillin their wishes
I got a degree in makin love
Yes I got it from my father just up above
I could take a girl from any man
With a twitch of my lips or wave of a hand
So to all you guys out there tonight
Grab your girl, hold her tight
Say treat her with respect and treat her right
Cause I might be in town for just one night
(Word)
(Do it)
(1-2-3-4-5-6 do it)
(We're here)
(We're back)

Baby Baby Please (Just A Little More Head) 
Chorus:
(Mixx scratches the line from "S

 M")
Verse 1:  Brother Marquis
I thought I was fuckin' until I got turned out
When the bitch said, "Marquis, can you stick your dick in my mouth?"
That experience has me all fucked up in the head
'Cause half of my time is spent in bed
And when she calls, you know I'ma come runnin'
With my dick in my hand, the first lick, I'm nuttin'
There's no freak in the world quite like you
'Cause you suck my dick until my balls turn blue
Chorus
Verse 2:  Fresh Kid Ice
I remember the first time I got a blow job
You know what I mean, when she slobs on Bob
She was kissin' the head, then she blew my balls
It felt like my skin had started to crawl
And the bitch kept suckin' like a freak in heat
Movin' like a basser without any sleep
And after she was done, this is what I said:
"Baby, baby, please!  Just a little more head!"

Bad Ass Bitch 
Chorus:
(Mixx scratches "Bad ass bitch!")
(During the breakdowns, we hear the Crew just hangin' out,
chit-chatting about their sexual encounters.  Most of their
words are inaudible.)
Verse 1:  Fresh Kid Ice
There's always one bitch in every town
Every time you see her, her panites are down
Always dressed fresh in the ladies' wear
She sports the weave instead of hair
Known to the boys as a real fly cutie
Tight-ass jeans to show that booty
When we met, I acted grinnin'
'Cause in my book, she was a queen
I felt that feelin', anticipation
Later came the stories of a reputation
She was burnin' since she was born 
I fucked anyway, 'cause the bitch was ON!
Chorus
Verse 2:  Brother Marquis
When we first met, I'll never forget
'Cause her lips were moist, a touch soft and wet
We danced, to a funky tune
And stared at each other in a smoke-filled room
I said, "What's up?  Are you down with it?
Let's go to the crib so I can run up in it!"
So we left the club for this night full of fun
I'm out for a splak, 'cause I'm not the one
For no bullshit or love-silly games
Let's get butt-booty naked and do the wild thing
First she took off her panties, snatched off her bra
Out popped the biggest tits I ever saw
They were big enough to knock a man down
They were shaped like grapes, and my favorite shade of brown
My dick was hard, and she was hot like a heater
By the looks of her mouth, she was a dick-eater
I said, "You raggedy bitch, don't play dumb!
Put my dick in your mouth and make this motherfucker cum!!"
Yeah!  This bitch was ON!!
Chorus
Verse 3
[BM]   The head was smokin', I had to call my friends
       In the next ten minutes, all the boys were in
       Dat was in the front and Lat was in the back
       The pussy was poppin' like Cracker Jack!
[FKI]  She had to get paid; I put her in the trick
       I gave her a penny for every inch of my dick
       We kept on fuckin' 'till the early morn
[ALL]  THAT BITCH WAS ON!!!

Banned In The U.S.A. 
[Government of the people]
[For the people]
[By the people]
News reporter:
Earlier today in Broward County, appalling court
judges upheld the previous
ruling to ban the sale of Miami rap group the 2 Live Crew's
double-platinum album, "Nasty As They Wanna Be," in Broward County.
"We think it's the banning of free speech.  First Amendment protects
material, resultably."
Luke (being interviewed):
"We don't talk about, uh, harrassing and sexually brutalizing women in
my music, man!"
"We don't do that in my music, man!  I'm tired of you saying that!"
Verse 1:  Fresh Kid Ice
We've got white-collar people trying to grab our style
Saying we're too nasty and we're 2 Live
Corrupted politicians playing games
Bringing us down to boost their fame
They must be joking thinking we will fall
But they're like flies movin' the wall
We stand tall from beginning to end
With the help from fans and all our friends
Freedom of speech will never die
For us to help, our ancestors died
Don't keep thinking that we will quit
We'll always stand and never sit
We're 2 live, 2 black, 2 strong
Doing the right thing, and not the wrong
So listen up, y'all, to what we say
We won't be banned in the U.S.A.!
Reporter:
"Luke's concerts are for adults"
Luke (being interviewed):
"If it's an adult show you have to be 18"
"Our record is a year old, but with all the publicity, there's a lot of
people ... curiosity is around!"
"We're selling records to a totally different audience."
"I take a precaution that nobody else has not stickered my album, I made
TWO versions"
Verse 2:  Brother Marquis
The First Amendment gave us freedom of speech
So what you sayin'?  It didn't include me?
I like to party and have a good time
There's nothin' but pleasure written in our rhyme
I know you don't think we'll ever quit
We've got some people on our side who won't take your lip
We're gonna do all the things we wanna do
You can't stand to see a brother get as rich as you
This is the 90s and we're conin' on strong
Sayin' things and doin' things that you're sayin's wrong

Luke (being interviewed):
"The show in Hollywood, that was for 21-and-over people, they had police
out there, cars of the people coming in the club, and they still
arrested us for performing in front of adults!"
Luke's speech:
What is this??  Is this not America?  This is not China!  This is not
Russia!  This is not the place where they brought down the wall, this is
America!  We have the right to say what we want to say, we have the right
to do what we want to do, and what I do in my house, 
you might not do in your house!
So what I do in my house is my business!  And the simple fact
of it all is that we are BONDED by the First Amendment!  We have the
freedom of EXPRESSION!  We have the freedom of CHOICE!  And you,
Chinese, black, green, purple, Jew, 
YOU have the right to listen to whoever
you want to, and even the 2 Live Crew!  So all you right-wingers, left-
wingers, bigots, Communists, there IS a place for you in this world!
Because this is the land of the FREE, the home of the BRAVE!  And 2 Live
is what we are!

Intro:  Astrid
Hey y'all motherfuckers out there, whassup?  You know your

cheerleading goin' on, so DROP THAT SHIT!!
Chorus (2x):
Come and be my private dancer! (3x)
I got some money if that's the answer!
Verse 1:  Brother Marquis
Sittin' here wonderin' who can I phone?  
My bitch done left me home alone
Dance for me in privacy, 
So no one else can bother me
Fantasies of a centerfold
So very beautiful but yet so bold
Picture me and you on a photo
Butt-booty naked, dancin' on my solo
Bitch, you know you got me in the zone
I'm on bone, can't wait to get it on
I'll do anything for you, please let me knock it
Even put some money in your pocket
Don't overcharge or play with my heart
I got cash or a credit card
Don't make me beg for a piece of ass
All I want is a private dance!
Chorus
Verse 2:  Fresh Kid Ice
Come on, bitch, let's have a party
You and me exclusively
Sex is what you're all about 
And I want you to turn me out
I really wanna be with you
I get hot after seein' you
Especially when you shake that ass
You keep me goin' when you shake it fast
Come on, take me for a ride
The freaks are out and it's on tonight
Show me shots Miami style
Butterfly, then open wide
So when it's over and I'm alone
I'm lookin' for the one to take me home
I gots to know, I need an answer
Would you be my private dancer?
Chrous
Verse 3
[Marquis] What your mama gave ya shouldn't be cherished
          Show me a shot, baby, don't be embarrassed
          The way you move is real funky
          Let me sit in that saddle and ride that donkey
          I also like the major cleavage
          Titties so big, yo, I can't believe it
          Put 'em in my face, 'cause that's where I love 'em
          She even got my name tattooed on one of 'em
[Kid Ice] Let me fuck, you know I am
          Bitch, what's my name?  (Chinaman!)
          So keep on dancin' and don't you stop
          'Cause it ain't over 'till a nigga nut'!
          So where you from, you sexy thing,
          'Cause it's that time to show that thing
          I gots to know, I need an answer

Bill So Horny 
[ ] = sampled words
[What'll we get for ten dollars?]
[Every t'ing you want.]
[Everything?]
[Every t'ing]
BILL:  Monica?
MONICA:  Yes, Bill?
B:  Monica, what would you do for a job here at the White House?
M:  I'd do anything, Bill.
B:  Really?
M:  Mm-hm.
B:  Well, do you swallow?
M:  I sure do, Bill.
B:  You do?
M:  Mm-hm.
B:  Well, what would you do with this cigar?
M:  Well why don't you let me show you, Billy.
[Ooh!  Don't do that, baby!  Ahh!]
[Hold on this!  Oh, sock it to me!  Aaah!]
Chorus (repeated during breakdowns)
[Ahh!  Me so horny!]
[Me love you long time!]
Verse 1:  Brother Marquis
Sittin' in my office with my dick on hard
Fuckin' all the interns 'cause I'm the boss
Picked up the telephone to call one of my bitches
Said, "What's up, Monica baby?  Can you come and kiss it?"
She arrived at the White House, knocked on the door,
Threw her draws on the floor and said "Fuck me!" like a whore
"I'm a freak in heat, a dog without warning!
Your dick is much bigger than Vernon Jordan's."
Chorus
BILL (during chorus):  Now Monica ... Monica, c'mon, let's go into the
Oval Office, girl.  I just wanna break you off a lil' somethin' ... Come
on now, let's go ... well, you know we can go half on it, baby ...
Verse 2:  Fresh Kid Ice
Gore always asks him why he sexes so much
It's the perks of being Prez; you always get a nut
Since you're married to Tipper, you shouldn't be sad
Don't tell Hilary so she won't get mad
'Cause you know she'll be disgusted if he ever gets busted
And Newt will be mad 'cause he didn't get the ass
He's a Prez in heat, a freak without warning
He loves oral sex, 'cause Bill so horny!
Chorus
BILL (during chorus):  Oh, Monica, I want you to come over here
and break me off in the Oval Office, now ... di-did you bring your
Presidential knee-pads?  I'm ready to get my freak on, girl, I don't
know about you ... I'm not a player no more, girl ... naw, I just
crush a lot ...
Verse 3:  Brother Marquis
You can say I'm a pervert or a desperate motherfucker
I'll hook you up with Paula and let you do each other
I'll play with your mind just like it's a game
I'll call my homie Vernon so we can run a "train"
And fuck Linda Tripp, 'cause I hate that bitch
I even got her on tape sucking on my dick
I'm a freak in heat, a dog without warning
Hilary's my wife, but Monica baby, you're my woman
Chorus
BILL (during chorus):  Oh Monica ... oh, I can't believe it's so
good, girl ... I'm gonna have to take you to the next Democratic
Convention ... so you can hook up all the fellas ... this'll be good
for some vogues ... I can't believe this ... ohhh God ...
Breakdown:
(Mixx cuts and scratches "Hey, what's the matter, baby?")
Chorus
BILL (during chorus):  Oh Monica, that's ... oh, that feels so goood!
Ohh!  Oh yes, ohhh!  Oh!  Ohh!  Ohhhh!!!  Oh yeah ... ohhh ... oh
yes!  Oh ...
Verse 4:  Fresh Kid Ice
It's true you weren't employed until you met Bill
He made you an intern, and you ratted still
You tell your parents that he turned you out
In the Oval Office of the White House
You said it yourself, you like it like he do
You put your lips on his cigar, and kissed it too
He's a freak in heat; Janet Reno didn't warn 'em
He loves oral sex, 'cause Bill so horny!
Chorus
Outro (repeated till end of track):
[Fuckie suckie]
[Me fuckie suckie]
BILL (during chorus and outro):  Monica, I can't believe you did this
to me!  I gave you a job, woman!  Dammit, why did you do this to me?
Now what's America gonna think?  I mean, it could've just been me,
you, and my wife Hilary!  No one had to know!  You didn't have to go
tell everybody, now!  Ken Starr's on my case and ... bringin' up all
that Linda Tripp and Paula Jones and ... Jennifer Flowers stuff!  My
wife won't even talk to me!  Hilary!  Hilary!  Hilary -- Chelsea, tell
your mom I'm talking to her!  Hilary, talk to me, dammit!  Cone on,
say somethin'!  I'll blow somethin' up if you don't talk to me,
woman!  I can't believe this! ... My career's in shambles ... but I

Boys With Da Bass 
Intro:
(mysterious music)
"Absolutely no one under 17 will be admitted 
without parent or certified adult guardian."
"They'll fry your brain.  They're sick as hell!"
"Jolly good fun."
"You'll die dancin'!"
"Dark, gliding shapes that glide every long inch ... "
"Buy 'em or die a thousand deaths!"
Chorus:
(Heyy!)
(2 Live Crew)
(Boys with the bass!)
("You better know it!")
Verse 1:  Fresh Kid Ice
That's right y'all, you heard it 'cause we said it
And if you can't read in the magazines,
You read about who?  You know the Crew!  Fresh outta Pac
And the first to put the bass on the 24-track
Some said it wouldn't work, some said it wouldn't last
In New York, they say that the tempo's too fast
You disregarded, but the albums got charted
We put 'em in the stores and millions habe bought it
An underground sound, not liked by radio
You hear it in the cars and at the dicso
On the airwaves, we misbehave
We're too bold, too rugged in our nasty ways
>From dirty minds come dirty rhymes
We're not gonna beg for your time
You don't play it?  That's cool with me
But somehow, our bass still reaches the street
As long as we got it, you can get it
People want the bass, so some try to steal it
From behind our back, and not in our face
'Cause 2 Live is the Crew, the boys with the bass!
Chorus
Verse 2:  Brother Marquis
Holdin' out own in the South-East region
When you come to the bottom, pledge to our allegiance
I'm glad to say that we're the proud owners,
The rock-and-rollers, you can't us this over
The name of the game is supply and demand
We supply the bass while you demand our jams
We could not wait to bring our bass to you
Because in this game, you lag, you lose
See, we serve our bass raw, straight up and not false
This is the kind you dance to, and not on 8-Ball
Plenty of bass, the beat, and the rhyme
That my homeboy Mr. Mixx carefully designed
Hittin' hard as hell, and always droppin'
Bass is the reason why you are rockin'
When you hear our songs, and you see our face
Put two and two together; we're the boys with the bass!

Break It On Down 
["Break it on down!"]
Verse 1:  Brother Marquis
Now let me break it on down and tell the story
When they say "2 Live," your mama gets worried
When they speak of us, the negative get mentioned
But we don't care; thanks for your attention
An underground sound, talkin' shit off the street
That Ghetto Style with a hard-ass beat
Our explicit lyrics tells it like it is
If you don't like what I'm saying, get the fuck outta here!
Luke Skyywalker, the man, not a myth
The king of the ghetto, down with the clique
As he gets mixin' he don't like attention;
He just likes to hear crowd participation
Pumpin' up the people, makin' them one crowd 
All in one motion, screamin' out loud
Together as one in every town
Slash' em on up, Luke!  ["Break it on down!"]
Verse 2:  Fresh Kid Ice
The definition of a good DJ
Is one who rocks the beat so the rhymes I say,
To get the party jumpin', is how I get paid
Benefits of a hit is when I get laid
Mr. Mixx is the one to get things goin'
So the rhymes we say will always be flowin'
Maximizin' the effect of our vocals
Whether nationwide or even local
His cuts and scratches taken to the extreme
Can only be matched in another's dreams
Doin' things with his body that couldn't be done
Rockin' the masses all for fun
He's always needed after every show
The Treach DJ, the only one you should know
Step to the Mixx and get the crowd off the ground
Come on, Mr. Mixx, and ["Break it on down!"]
Verse 3:  Brother Marquis
If you ask me to rap, rap for you I'll do so
I'm the type of nigga that'll break it down slow
I rhyme like an artist, such as DaVinci
Like the Mona Lisa, I'm a sight to see
This is not a tale and I'm not a character 
Just a kind of MC who loves to harass ya
Out my dome, I'll start thinkin'
Get so funky 'til I start stinkin'
I don't think slow when it comes to rhymes
When times create, I shift to overdrive
Now all the competition, they're my last worries
I'll take 'em out quick, fast and in a hurry
Now I can go the distance, I can go the length
It's not the weak, because it's all in the strength
You don't know?  You mean you ain't heard?
Yours truly, Marquis, can ["Break it on down!"]

Bulldagger Stole My Bitch 
*Brother Marquis does all the verses
{Shari Lewis}
Come ... give us a little kiss ... let me make it better.
{Dolemite}
These rotten ass bitches is gonna fuckin' wanna know!
Verse 1
I met this bitch at a hip-hop disco
A club full of divas in San Francisco
I asked her name, the bitch said Shirley
I asked her for some pussy, she said "I like girlies."
"What that mean, hoe, that I can't have it?"
She said, "Nigga, recognize I'm a female faggot!"
You triflin'-ass bitches know that shit ain't right
Stinkin'-ass dyke, put some dick in your life
'Cause we know where the nose goes in the nymphos
Playin' with dildos and finger-fuckin' booty holes
Belly to belly, skin to skin
Fuckin' like hell, but ain't no dick goin' in
If they like pussy that much, then let me fuck it
Stick it in, take it out, and let 'em suck it
But they game is strong and they tongue is long
A bulldagger beat and got yo' bitch and gone!
Chorus:  Brother Marquis and Mr. Mixx
A bulldagger done stole my bitch
She'd rather suck pussy, she don't want no dick!
[A bulldagger done stole MY bitch!
Bitch told me she don't want no dick!]
A bulldagger done stole my bitch
She'd rather eat pussy than suck a nigga' dick!
[A bulldagger done stole MY bitch!
Fuck y'all hoes, y'all hoes ain't shit!]
Verse 2
Bulldaggers come in all shapes, sizes and colors
A bitch that eat pussy makes a good dick-sucker
Never kiss a bulldagger hoe in the mouth
It smells like shit from all the ass she got
Freaky hoes got them tendencies
Why go that way, bitch, when you can get these?
Some girls'll do it, some girls don't
A bulldaggin' hoe will do what your boyfriend won't
A bulldagger is the worst kind of player hater
'Cause niggas still fuck 'em, that's why they can't fade us
Sayin' they strictly dickly, but that ain't true
A bulldagger got more bitches than me and you
Now bulldaggers, you know they don't play fair
They get all the pussy, and they don't share
But they game is strong and they tongue is long
A bulldagger beat and got yo' bitch and gone!
Chorus
Verse 3
I hate bulldaggin' hoes with a passion
You motherfuckin' right a nigga gave bashin'
You bitches need to get that gay shit off your mind
Suckin' 'em up, that's sick, I dick 'em down at night
Lickin' clits, suckin' titties, and playin' with kitties
And sophisticated dykes'll treat a nigga shitty
I can't understand how a bitch with class
Would have another hoe's name tattooed on her ass
Spittin' at my hoes but they can't be chose
Because BITCH, my pussy's bought and paid fo'!
Now you motherfuckin' dykes ain't got no shame
French-kissin', holdin' hands like it ain't no thing
Your game is workin', but I got the last virgin
You doin' the slurpin' while I'm doin' the servin'
But they game is strong and they tongue is long
A bulldagger beat and got yo' bitch and gone!
Chorus
Woman:
Naw, mu'fucker.  You tryin' to blow my game?  My bitches 
said somethin' to you, my shit just won't be the same, 
motherfucker, n' I can't have that!!
Outro:
Yeah, Mr. Mixx and Brother Marquis representin', straight 
up on the down south tip!  For the 9-5 shot!  You know we 
talkin' 'bout they raggedy ass, nigga, ain't no motherfuckin' 
thang, 'knamsayin'?  Don't nobody say 'nything personal,
come on, girl, y'know?  Boys back up at that ass!  One time
for the bottom!  You know how they do it.

Here to run down a rhyme at your request
I'm the New York born, who's sharp as a thorn
I came here tonight just to get it on
So listen up close and listen up well
Cause the Brother Marquis has a story to tell
This is a story about an MC
Who got real brave and challenged me
He thought that he was bad, he thought he was tough
Until I, what, until I called his bluff
And as the battle began, his rhymes got weaker
You couldn't even hear his voice come out the speaker
And as he started to get ignored
The party people turned and walked off the floor
They did not applaud and they did not cheer
And homeboys just said "Get the fuck outta here"
So as I cracked a smile and started to laugh
I could see the sucka duck muthafucka gettin mad
He had a frown on his face, he was hotter than fire
He wasn't competition but just a little biter
So, as he turned and walked away
With his head to the ground and nothing to say
Cause he was busted, disgusted, and couldn't be trusted
He tried to battle me and found self-DESTRUCTION

That was jet-set, so soft and wet
Now Kisha's on my tip, and that you can bet
Until one day I got caught in the act
With my girl named Melissa from a few days back
Kisha done called me up and asked me to explain
She said I played with her heart like it was a game

BM = Brother Marquis
FKI = Fresh Kid Ice
Intro:  (sound of woman being fucked)
Verse 1
[BM]  When the party's over, we can get together,
           Go to my house and fuck forever,
           And do whatever comes to mind
           Let me stick my dick in your behind
           You can pour me a glass of Dom Perignon
           Then suck my dick until I cum
           Soft is your body, tender is your kiss
           C'mon, baby, we can do this!
[FKI]  No need to act stuck-up, pretty and seditty
           Got a funky disposition and you think you're witty
           You're not used to people saying things like this
           It's called criticism, and not a diss
           I only give compliments when they are due
           Now I'm gonna tell you all the truth
           You claim to be a virgin, I mean the purest
           I'll be gentle, baby, 'cause we can do this!
 Verse 2
[BM]   Love is the key to end all your woes
           You'll be my bitch, not a dirty hoe
           Together as one we will be
           I'll be fucking you and you'll be sucking me
           Then lick my ass up and down
           Lick it 'till your tongue turns doo-doo brown
           Don't try to be slick and give me a kiss
           C'mon, baby, we can do this!
[FKI]  Bitch, it's time to spend the night
           Let's walk the beach in the moonlight
           Holding each other like lovers do
           When the pussy's wet, I'll know what to do
           Makin' love, holdin' you near
           Screams and moans is all I hear
           Quick is your tongue, soft is your lips
           Suck it, bitch, 'cause you can do this!
Verse 3
[BM]   Let's get it goin' on, let's act a fool
           Listen and learn while I take you to school
           You say you don't fuck on the first date?
           Then fuck you, bitch!  I ain't gonna wait
           'Cause my dick is hard and my back is strong
           I'll find another bitch to get it on
           'Cause now is the time so stop the bullshit
           C'mon, baby, we can do this!
[FKI]  As you move your body, the shit you say
           Will make any man want to stay
           'Cause being with you is all I ask
           And fucking you will be my task
           My lonely nights will be filled with fun
           No more clubs and sex on the run
           Just suck this dick, while here I lay
           You can do this, so c'mon, babe!
(Mixx cuts "Fuck me, bitch!")
Verse 4
[BM]   Bitch, you say you's gonna give me some
           Now you wanna start acting dumb
           You wanna play cat and mouse
           When I catch you, I'ma stick my dick in your mouth
           Now stop the teasin' and start the pleasin'
           Just fuck me good until I skeet
           Bitch, stop fakin', you need to quit it
           C'mon, baby, 'cause we can do this!
[FKI]  Step to me and fall to your knees
           Suck this dick, put me at ease
           Do something special you know I like
           Smokin' head and please don't bite
           Slow and easy I pull the seat back
           Up and down, as I climax
           Steady in motion, I quietly say
           We can do this, so suck it, babe!

Her skin's gettin' tanned 'cause it's 90 degrees
I took her home and met the homeboys
Before gettin' bored we'll avoid the noid
Went to Opa Locka, jumped in Luke's jet
To the Bahamas and Mixx said, "Bet"
We landed in Naussau, when walkin downtown
We met four females, all of were down
Went to the beach on Paradise Isle
We played water sports and had sex for a while
Before we knew it it was time to go
'cause the very next day we had a show
We'll let the people see that 2 Live is rulin'
(Now back to the crib where we'll be coolin')
[ VERSE 2: Brother Marquis ]
Coolin' with the posse, playin' it hard
Rollin' two deep as I drop the top
Beams from the sun light up the city
As I roll through sidin', sittin real pretty
It's a hot summer day and I feel good
So I turned up some music and hit the neighborhood
Spoke to the brothers, sweatin' the ladies
I bumped into my homeboy Ice in the Mercedes
Went up on the ave. where they hustle real hard
Skeezers on the side cold jockin' our cars
Someone called my name, so I yoked it quick
And kicked it to the girlies who was all on the tip
As nightfall came I was still out there
Havin' fun on the one, carefree without a care
You say it, we can play it, I'm here for the choosin'
Marquis is chillin' hard, coolin'
[ VERSE 3: Fresh Kid Ice ]
Livin' the life of the rich and famous
We never had it so good, so who can blame us?
Here's a toast to our success
Break out the Dom 'cause we owe it to ourselves
So let's find a hideaway in the Carribean
Sail the ocean like a long-shore seaman
Goin' to the Islands to have some fun
Hit the beach and take in a little sun
[ Brother Marquis ]
Feelin' the breezes of the cool winds blowin'
On a mission, not knowin' where I'm goin'
It's a free day, and I got free time
And I'm loving every minute of this life of mine
You see, the lady I choose must like to cool
In a freak's cut bikini by the pool
[ Fresh Kid Ice ]
Havin' good times, that's what we'll be doin'
Like millionaires, stone cold coolin'

Dirty Nursery Rhymes 
[Brother Marquis]
My mama and your mama was talking little shit
My mama called your mama a bulldagging ass bitch
I know your sister, and the bitch ain't shit
She slayed me and all the boys
And even sucked our dicks
Jack and Jill went up the hill to have a little fun
Jack got mad, kicked Jill in the ass
Cause she couldn't make him cum
Mama Bear and Papa Bear went for a walk through the forest
Mama Bear asked Papa Bear could he eat her porridge
Papa Bear said 'shit bitch, you must think I'm sick
Just get down here, on your knees
And suck this badass dick'
Abraham Lincoln was a good old man
He hopped out the window with his dick in his hand
Said 'excuse me lady, I'm doing my duty
So pull down your pants and give me some boody'
[Fresh Kid Ice]
There's an old lady who lives in a shoe
Got a house full of kids don't know what to do
She sucked and fucked all the niggas around
When it's time to pay rent couldn't none be found
Little miss Muffet sat on a tuffet
With her legs gapped open wide
Up came a spider, looked up inside her
And said 'that pussy's wide'
Little Jack Horner sat in a corner
Fucking this cutie pie
Stuck in his thumb, made the bitch cum
Said 'hell of a nigga am I'
Humpty Dumpty fell off the wall
Cause a hoe on the ave. was sucking his balls
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Couldn't put that fat motherfucker back together again
[Luke]
Hey wait, I got one, did this, I got one, check this out
The two dudes, dig this, the two dudes
Two dudes dressed like nuns, right
[Brother Marquis]
Little Red Riding Hood was on her way
To grandmother's house
But before she got there she met this man
That turned her hot ass out
[Fresh Kid Ice]
Rupunzle, Rupunzle let down your hair
The dog's on my ass and getting near
The hair came loose and fell in a lake
Bitch check the weave that's in that lake
[Luke]
Bitch, get that weave out!
You dirty bitch, get that weave out!
Mix say, bitch get that weave out...

Do The Bart 
News Reporter:
Well, it seems they're in the news again.  The 2 Live Crew has
started a dance craze that has basically taken the nation by
storm!  Here's a report.
Verse 1:  Fresh Kid Ice
There's a brand new dance and it's comin' to your town
It's done by the people who can really throw down
You don't need to be a queen or a jack of spades
It's done by the brothers with the hi-top fades
It doesn't matter if you're shy or wild
It's done by all, man or child
Keep shakin' your head, like a goose
And work your body 'till it gets loose
Ladies, bend your back and also your knees
Shake your titties and let me squeeze
Then make a face like you wanna fart
Keep workin' them arms while doin' the Bart!
Verse 2
[Marquis]  Jitterbugs keep pumpin'!  Why you frontin'?
           On the Bart, I'll keep the house jumpin'
           Everybody follow me, do that dance, the B-A-R-T
           Just step to the right and left
           Do the Bart 'till you're out of breath
[Kid Ice]  It's brand new, the dance to do
           The move for the 90's and it's comin' through
           Girls, shake your titties and fall to your knees
           Show that ass so I can squeeze
           Then make the face like you wanna fart
           Work them arms while doin' the Bart!
Verse 3:  Brother Marquis
It's the Bart, y'all, the brand new dance
Fellas, grab your dick; girls, shake that ass
To do this dance you must wear Nike's
Girl, you need bikinis, and no sexy nighties
To do this dance, you can't act cute
Fellas, get upon that ass like you're knockin' the boots
In!  Out!  Up and down!
When you're doin' the Bart, you're really gettin' down!
When you're doin' the Bart, you're gonna get wet
Right Guard can't save you, 'cause you're bound to sweat
Fat girls, we ain't forgot about you
The Bart's the dance that you can even do
First you need a tight fade, a couple black medallions,
Some skiddo pants and then start dancin'
Unlike the Hammer, unlike the Humpty,
When you're doin' the Bart, you've gotta get funky!
[Kid Ice]  It's the dance of the 90s, motherfuckers act wild
           Your Granny can do it, so you should try
           It's not just a dance; it's a state of mind
           The fellas need to hi-jump the girls' big behinds
           Keep shakin' your head, like a goose
           And work your body 'till it get loose
[Marquis]  Jump up and down, but don't freak or hustle
           When you're doin' the Bart, you use every muscle
           Don't hurt yourself or exert yourself
           You can do the Bart all by yourself
           So why you sittin' there in your seat?
           Just get on the floor and Bart to the beat!

Do The Damn Thing 
( ) = woman's line
[Let's get it on, I'm open real wide!]
Chorus {2x}:  Mr. Mixx
I wanna do the damn thaaaaAAANG! (Then do the damn thing!)
I wanna do the damn thaaaang! (Then do the damn thing!)
Verse 1:  Fresh Kid Ice
I'm a bad motherfucker bringin' hoes to their knees
Fresh Kid Ice, long dick Chinese
Always on a mission 'cause I like to fuck
The way I hit the pussy is in the buck
Strokin' up and down, always takin' my time
Doin' it all till I make you mine
I rub your body with motion lotion
Lick you down like waves in the ocean
Do it till you're satisfied
Have you moan even though you're tired
I've fucked many bitches across the land
And no one slangs dick like the Chinaman
You ain't been fucked 'cause your pussy's froze
Many are called but few are chose
Bust them guts like it ain't no thing
So bitch stop frontin', let's do the damn thing!
Chorus
Verse 2:  Brother Marquis
Bitch, do you wanna swing with me?
Sex is the best with Brother Marquis
All hoes let my record show
All my bitches come back for more
It must be the way I throw my thang
It must be the way I spit my game 
Look 'em in they eye, tell a quick lie
Kiss 'em and they cry, I don't know why
Game so strong, yet so convincin'
Give me a minute, I'm up in it
Talk 'em out they draws real cool
"Bitch, give it up smooth, you know the rules!"
True love ain't so hard to find
It's right between your legs and mine
None of my bitches, they never complain
They like the way I do the damn thing!
Chorus
Verse 3
[Marquis]  I love it when a bitch be like pro-per
           A hooche with a coochie that'll let me pop her
           The "Blac Vagina Finda"
           Once I'm inside I must remind her
           Pussy's deception, dick's a weapon
           After I fuck, I'm steppin'
           Damn right, ain't nothin' changed
           That's the way I do my thang!
[Kid Ice]  Let me do it, like nothin' before
           I don't need a friend, I need a whore
           I need a bitch who'll fuck all night
           Take plenty of dick, and the pussy's right
           She'll keep me goin' till she gets me off
           And bring me up, when I'm soft
           Let's get together 'cause it ain't no thang
           You and me, baby, doin' the damn thang!
Chorus
Mr. Mixx:
(Do the damn thang!)  Hey, I'm doin' it, baby!
(Now rub the damn thang!)  Damn right, I'm rubbin' it, baby!
(Kiss the damn thang!)  Mmmmm-kissin'in' it, baby!
(Now do the damn thang!)  Then turn around, baby!
UHH!  UHH!  Now throw the damn thaaAANG!
Throw, throw it!  Throw, the damn thang, baby! {2x}

Drop The Bomb 
2x:
{Everybody over there!}  {Get on up!}
{Everybody up there!}  {Get into it!}
{Everybody right there!}  {Get involved!}
Verse 1:  Brother Marquis
All the people on the left, just participate
And everybody o the right, we won't make you wait
And all the people inbetween, just shout and scream 
And have a funky good time if you know what I mean
Because when we rhyme, we move people by the masses
When they say they'll pay we'll play when they ask us
Some say they don't know of us but that is a lie
Suckas try to play they games of Dis-and-Die
And don't you try to shake my hand or be my friend
Unlike a hook made out of rubber I will not bend!
{Drop the bomb!!}
Verse 2:  Fresh Kid Ice
To all you silly suckas wo try to abuse us:
When we get ignited you can't diffuse us
It'll be on radio and even TV
That we achieved a level where you wanna be
Now step off the pedestal, give us the mike
So we can rock the people the way you would like
Just do us a favor, don't be a jerk
'Cause all we wanna see is your body work!
{But all we want to see is yo' body work!}
{Work yo body!}
Verse 3
[Kid Ice] There's a lesson to be taught, that's the one you should learn
          You can't buy respect; it's what you earn
          'Cause when you dis 2 Live you get yours in the end
          It's not a threat; it's a promise, my friend!
[Marquis] So suckas step aside, let the women do their thing
          Come on y'all, and shake that thing!
{Work that thing!}
{Yes!!}

Face Down Ass Up 
Chorus(2x):  Luke
FACE DOWN ASS UP!  THAT'S THE WAY WE LIKE TO FUCK!
(repeated by the rest of the Crew)
Verse 1:  Fresh Kid Ice
I'm lookin' for a bitch to spend the night
Do the crazy thing while I fuck all night
I make her do things like nothing before
And when I'm done, she'll always be sore
>From the things I do when I'm fuckin'
And when I'm tired, the bitches are suckin'
A double team with a friend of mine
Luke's in front and I'm behind
Just ridin' you like a pony
While you suck my dick, makin' me horny
Then all of a sudden we'll switch positions
Prop your ass up and freak the pushin'
And when I cum, you'll hear me roar
I'll treat any bitch like a whore
'Cause it's the way I like to fuck
It's face down and ass up!
Chorus
Verse 2:  Brother Marquis
Face down, ass up, that's the way I like to fuck
I like the butt, it's my favorite position
I'm tired of the front, so that's why I'm bitchin'
Flip-flop it, baby, bend your ass over
In a full house spread, let me hold ya
Marquis, a raw dick motherfucker
Virgin mouthpieces, the best dick-suckers
Dick-tricks, go round and round
Grip it with your pussy, go up and down
I got her callin' my name out when I'm freakin' out
I bust a nut, and then I'm breakin' out
So when you're naked, down on all fours
You better make sure that you get yours
'Cause a nigga like me will love ya and leave ya
I got mine, hoe!  SEE YA!
Chorus
Verse 3:  Luke
OK fellas, I got one right here, aaight? Check this out:
Lemme hear you say,
"Pussy ain't nuttin' but meat on the bone
Suck it or fuck it or leave it alone!"
(they all repeat)
Say "Pussy ain't nuttin' but meat on the bone
Suck it or fuck it or leave it alone!"
(they all repeat)
OK ladies, I got one for y'all!
Say "Dick ain't nuttin' but meat on the bone
Suck it or fuck it or leave it alone!"
(the ladies repeat)
All the ladies lemme hear you say
"Dick ain't nuttin' but meat on the bone
Suck it or fuck it or leave it alone!"

Feel Alright Y'all 
Verse 1:  Fresh Kid Ice
Feelin' all right on a party night
Good times are in store, everybody get hype
Motivation of your body is what we do best
With lyrics so def it's above the rest
New Jack's tryin' to change, but you're lame to the game
Frontin' like your're hard, with a fake gold chain
Tryin' to rock the mike, but we're on the ball
We make the people say ... 
Chorus (2x):  Luke
Feel all right y'all!!
Feel like dynamite!!
Verse 2:  Brother Marquis
They're doggin' my mood, but that's all right
Let me discuss and make a fuss with the use of the mike
So as I step to the podium and cause pandemonium
With crowds of people, rockin' auditoriums
Screamin', yellin', swayin' while I'm sayin'
My verbal expression while the music is playin'
This is for all of y'all, I hope you like
This is designed to make you feel all right!
Chorus
Verse 3
[BM]   You try to out-recite me, but that's not likely
       I can tell whether or not if you hate or if you like me
       'Cause above all I arise, so don't you be surprised
       When I get recognition from the public eye
[FKI]  And I'll do all the things that the people like
       Kid Ice will excite you when he's on the mike
       It's time to act ill and get on the ball
       Everybody in the place scream out and say ...

Freaky Behavior 
Blowfly:
"Turn over!  I'ma stick it in y'ass!  'No, it's gon' hurt!'
You'll get used to it."
Verse 1:  Brother Marquis
Lady Godiva was a freak
She rode buttnaked to the street
By doing this a hundred years ago,
It's all right for girls to be hoes
Romeo, where's Juliet?
She's out gettin' her pussy wet
My man Samson and that bitch Delilah,
She got mad 'cause Samson tried her
All the ass was for a little head
But she played it off like she was scared
Knowing all the time she was a freak
And couldn't wait to get in the sheets
There's a freak in every demon
They even had sex in the Garden of Eden
It's the devil's work, the Lord can't save ya
We got it bad, that freaky behavior
Verse 2:  Fresh Kid Ice
To some she's shy and to others she's wild
But to her daddy she's an innocent child
Not knowing what's happening when he's away
But like a bitch in heat, she's ready to play
She fucked five niggas 'till they all got sore
Then laughed in they face, and asked for more
She does what she wants, and no one can save her
A product of society with the freaky behavior
Verse 3:  Brother Marquis
Hoe, you know you're my aphrodesiac
Before you suck my dick, can you pull the skin back?
You're a dog-ass bitch doing dirty deeds
If your period's on, then fall to your knees
Bitch, you belong in a sex asylum
Every trick in the book, your dog ass has tried 'em
Blame it on your mama, 'cause it's how she raised ya
I guess that explains your freaky behavior
Verse 4:  Fresh Kid Ice
She's also wild, but only she can stand it
Fuckin' all the boys and making 'em cum in a minute
The best dick sucker that could ever be found
Who'll suck your balls, then drink the cum
Up on the 'ave, she's more than a teaser
And to the boys, our own private skeezer
You can tell her daddy, but no one can save her
She does what she wants with her freaky behavior!

Get Loose Now 
Chorus:
(Mixx cuts "Get Loose Now" from "It Takes Two")
Verse 1:  Fresh Kid Ice
People everywhere, just check this out
Say, something brand new that'll make you shout
For you, and you, and all to see
The dopest rhymes, said by me
Listin' these facts for all to know
How to rock a party, keep the crowd on the go
It starts with the beat, then comes the rhyme
The stance that's hard to keep you on time
We'll add a little scratch to give some flavor
So the mix'll be right for you to savor
There's only one way to move the crowd:
Bass level up high, volume level up loud
To do youre best, you gotta believe
And what you want, you'll soon achieve
It's who you know to get your juice
I started with rhymes and I get loose!
Chorus
Verse 2:  Brother Marquis
This is a section, some of a rehearsal
So sucker MC's don't take it personal
I don't mean to talk about you or put you down
But I get loose out the door and go and freestyle
You see, the point I'm trying to make comes out so clear
I be bustin' lyrics 'till I leave here
I don't claim to be the best; I'm funky, not fresh
I just want to get respected, with all the rest
You see, I come from down South, talk slick out my mouth
I went to New York and got kicked out
Because they don't like me; they just like us as a whole
'Cause the music we make (?) we got soul
So tell me the truth; it's monkey see monkey do
We cuss on a record; now you wanna cuss too
>From Hi-top fades to jhericurl juice
Watch Marquis y'all, as I get loose!
Chorus
Verse 3:  Fresh Kid Ice
Get on up, let me bust a rhyme
Something that happened ahead this time
I was coolin' out, doin' my work
Then suddenly, it went berserk
Marquis came in with a couple girls
All the boys went crazy, takin' off clothes
We all got naked, no time to front
Clear the desk, 'cause you know what I want
Grabbed one by the hair, threw her on the floor
Opened her thighs, and guess what I saw
A hell of a mess, oh, what a bush
In a couple of minutes I'll be there to push
And back and forth, the momentum goes
I keep on strokin' as I get on my toes
She kept on moanin' 'till she started to juice
I'm in control when I get loose!

Ghetto Bass II 
Mr. Mixx:
Ghetto Style Dee-Jays!
{Don't touch that stereo!}
{Ghetto}  {Bass}
Verse 1:  Fresh Kid Ice
What's up, party people, we're back again
Bringin' you the message from some of our friends
They're the funkiest crew from the heart of the city
When the amps are on, they'll take no pity
'Cause Ghetto has the style that has the girls jockin'
When you talk about the system, all you say is "Rockin'!"
Others hear the name, then scream out loud
'Cause they are known to move the crowd
When you hear the sound, they'll stop and wonder
Then gaze upon the speaker, the wall of thunder
Standin' on the ground, 3 stories high
The deepest bass and the real fresh high
So step off your throne; they're on the loose
The DJ's from Miami with all the juice
So consider yourself warned; they're back on the case:
It's Luke Skyywalker and the Ghetto Style Bass!
{Ghetto}  {Get up}
Verse 2:  Brother Marquis
To some, "Ghetto" is a name; to others a tradition
In the city of boom, ther can never be an addition
Of any of the DJ's to rock the land
Like the ones from the city and the boys from Pac-Jam
Handsome Harry, you know the brother was strong
He ain't dared any man to get him wrong
L.A. Jay, this young brother doesn't play
He'll strong-arm any sucker who gets in his way
Baby Ced, Liberty City born and bred
Always known for the knowledge and sense of the head
Disco Gene, he's reunited with the team
He was gone for a while, but back in the swing of things
Amazing Chico, a king to his trade
Known as Bernie B. on 9-1-7 Bass
And G.I. Joe, who has the girls by the row
He always gets cased 'cause his game is gettin' slow
And last but not least, marvelous J.P.,
And we can't forget Cisco - we're glad you are free
So one day to your kids you will tell the story
Of how the Ghetto Style DJ's achieved their glory!

Hangin' Out 
["It's not the way to do it!"]
[gunshots]
["Shut up bitch!"]
["Yeahhhhh boyyyyy!"]
["You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge."]
["This is serious business."]
["Come by boy!"]
Verse 1:  Fresh Kid Ice
Hangin' on the corner, lookin' real sporty
Coolin' with the fellas while downin' a 40
Nothing to do, just killin' time
Sittin' on my ride with my hand on my 9
Gettin' a buzz, feelin' kinda nice
Homie dropped a 20, so we shot some dice
We played for a while, 'till my luck was out
So the bitches walked by and my dick popped out
Rankin' on the bitches hanging in the street
It's feedin' time, so hoe, come eat
Nibble on this dick, make me just say please
You know how it's done, like a rat does cheese
The hoe started buggin', jumped in my face
Since the boys were stressin', I had to punch her in the face
Grabbed the weave, stuffed it in her mouth
Don't fuck with the Kid while I'm hangin' out!
(Interval:  Marquis talking.  Most of his words are indistinct.)
Verse 2:  Brother Marquis
Me and my nigga, rollin' hard
Hangin' out, the whole nine yards
I'm smokin' a fat one, takin' a 40 to the head
Watch out, fool, get shot dead
And bitches clownin', cryin' and all that
But yet, still, I keep my gat
Rollin' real hard in a six-tre ('63)
Motherfuckin' punk, step out my way
And all you fools in the game, you silly-ass lames
You can't fuck with me; I'm wild and not tame
Like a savage beast, I'm out on the street
So, motherfucker, what's up with that?  You wanted beef?
Punk, you got a problem?  I'll solve 'em!
I pulled his gat; his life cost him
So don't fuck with me while I'm around in the back
I'm always strapped when I'm hangin' out!

Here I Come 
Verse 1:  Fresh Kid Ice
I remember back when, how the Kid got scarred
Beggin' for pussy; bitches actin' hard
I gots no play for the lack of papers
For the dope boys, I had the vapors
'Cause they got the hoes for the money they were stackin'
And all I had was dreams of rappin'
But a few months later the scenario changed
With a record and a video; now the Kid had game
They jumped over buildings, straight on the dick
It hit me so hard thinkin' I was it
They tripped me out, a sudden change of flavor
Hoes kissin' my ass wantin' to do me favors
But no matter how they tried to fuck with my pride
Ice Cold Productions won't slip or slide
'Cause when I was comin' up you was talkin' shit
Now that I made a nigga suck a dick
I know what's happenin', don't think I'm dumb
Kid Ice is movin' up, so here I come!
Chorus:
[Make way, 'cause here I come!]
Verse 2:  Brother Marquis
Marquis is the man, and I'm on a mission
To make a lot of money is my main ambition
Fuck niggas, and fuck hoes too
The meal is made, so let's eat food
But some motherfuckers try to hold ya back
Some are white, but most are black
Goin' out like that makes me laugh
But they all can kiss the crack of my ass
And you know and I know who I'm talkin' about
Y'all need to shut your fuckin' mouth and step aside! 
You better make way, 'cause here I come, motherfucker!
Chorus
Verse 3:  Fresh Kid Ice
Steppin' to the light, and out the darkness
To relieve the pressure and all the madness
So here I come, a young man on the rise
Doin' what's right to stay alive
In a world of negativity and full of pain
We're brothers, down with each other for they own gain
So I keep on steppin', and keep on rappin'
Statyin' above the others, you know what's happenin'
For the better of myself, and not the fame
I try to make a livin' in this hip-hop game
If you wanna try, come and get some
Step out my way, 'cause here I come!
Chorus
Outro:  Mr. Mixx
Mr. Mixx, producer of 2 Live!  Niggas slip, but I'ma let 
that slide.  Dope producer, you know I ain't playin', 
got 3 golds and a platinum, y'know what I'm sayin'? Fuck-
niggas always talk that fuck-shit, sayin' that Mixx ain't 
legit.  For the niggas that ain't with it, you can suck me 
and all the boys' dick, y'know what I'm sayin'?  2 Live in

Hoochie Mama 
Intro: Mr. Mixx
Big booty hoes -- up wit it!
Hoochie mamas -- up wit it!
Let me see ya touch the ground!
Verse 1:  Brother Marquis
I don't know my reputation
But all the niggas in the hood say it's all good
But the bitch ain't shit, so you need to make a switch
Smackin' on ya lips with your hands on your hips
Triflin' slimy, don't try me
Playin' on the phone?  You supposed to be grown
Bitch, stop lyin', I ain't with it
Keep runnin' ya mouth and I'ma stick my dick in it
Hoochie hoodrat needs home training
Ghetto-ass always complaining
Tryin to clown in front of my friends
By the way, bitch, can I get those ends?
Fuck theatrics, you ain't no actress
Lay on the mattress and let a nigga splak it
The bitch is full of DRAMA!!
Hoochie hoodrat is a hoe like her momma!
Chorus (2x): Mr. Mixx
She ain't nothin' but a hoochie mama!
[Hoodrat, hoodrat, hoochie mama!]
Yeah, she ain't nothin' but a hoochie mama!
[Hoodrat, hoodrat, hoochie mama!]
Verse 2:  Fresh Kid Ice
Hoe I love your big brown eyes
And the way you shake your thighs
Actin' like you're so damn cute
Let a real nigga just knock them boots
I don't need no confrontation
All I want is an ejaculation
'Cause I like them ghetto hoochies
Ones who like to pop that coochie
[Hoo wee!] Miami style!
Makin niggas smile, bitch get wild
'Cause freaky shit is what I like
and I love to see two bitches dyke
My favorite time is 69
Bitch you know it's hoochie time
Fuck what you heard and save the drama
All I want is my hoochie mama!
Chorus (4x): Luke
You ain't nothin' but a hoochie ma-ma!
[Hoodrat hoodrat hoochie mama!]
Verse 3
Marquis:
Mama just don't understand 
Why I love your hoochie ass
Sex is what I need you for 
I got a good girl, but I need a whore
I like my bitch promiscous 
Hot in the ass and ready to fuck
Foreplay your way, our way, my way
Trick or freak, and I hit it on Friday
Kid Ice:
Girl, you know you look so cute
Ridin' 'round town in ya Dazzey Dukes
Come on over for a visit
Let a nigga ride in ya Civic
Cos I like them ghetto hoochies
One who got them big ol' booties
Save the drama for your mama
All I want is my hoochie mama
Chorus (4x): Luke
You ain't nothin' but a hoochie ma-ma!

I Can't Go For That 
Chorus:  
(Mixx scratches "I can't go for that" and "nooo")
Verse 1:  Fresh Kid Ice
Have you ever met a girl who dressed real fly
And wanted all the things that your money could buy?
She wanted gold chains, a brand new Louie
You gotta spend money to get that coochie
She'll find a man who thought he was raw 
Then leave him heartbroken when his money was no more
She'll get any man and treat him nice 
Now she wanted me, the Fresh Kid Ice
But I knew her game, and that's a fact
I'm sorry to say that ...
Chorus
Verse 2:  Brother Marquis
You're taking my kindness for a weakness
I find out your game with the quickness
I'm streetwise; I can see no good
'Cause that's the law in my neighborhood
You think that you're slick, and you can get over
But not on me, Marquis, your brother
When I first met you, you seemed to be different
Now you're askin' me for money?  I ain't with it!
You don't love me, so stop lyin'
Don't try to run a guilt-trip down by cryin'
Chorus
Verse 3
[FKI]  Women these days aren't realistic
         They'll drive a man crazy 'cause they're materialistic
         Always wantin' things we can't afford
         And when we say no, they pretend to be bored
[BM]   You can't fool me or see through me
         There's something about you that just gets to me
         You're scummin, and bummin', I hate to see you come and
         Want to get in my pockets?  You gets nothin'!
         "Baby, don't trip me," what's up with that?
         I ain't no sucka, I can't go for that!

Young Jews, Be Proud 
[spoken, with drums getting progressively louder]
Jus' look at them.
I tell you, it warms the heart to see the little ones out there.
Y' know, it wasn' always this easy for us to sit back an' enjoy the little ones.
Never forget what your people wen' through to get you here,
An' it's for you to tell them about us.  You know that, don't you?
[rapped]
Yeah!  Kick it!
C'mon, my brothers/sisters out in every land!
It's up to you to shake the world, so you must understand
>From where our people have come and to where they must go,
So now I'll kick a little history that you should know.
You see, the Jews have been oppressed for thousands of years.
To every corner of the world you can trace our tears.
We were enslaved by the Pharoahs 'till God sent Moses.
Even after he delivered us, it was no bed of roses.
For forty years we wandered on the barren desert sand
'Till Joshua the leader brought us to the promised land,
So when ya kick this rhyme, you wanna sing it out loud.
You are the nation of our fathers.  Young Jews, be proud!
[musical interlude: Jewish music played on synthesizer with drums]
Now our people lived here, and they held this place,
And they were ruled by the great leaders of our faith.
Now, from the house of Jesse came David the King.
He kept the nation strong.  He wrote the songs we sing.
His son Solomon the Wise had it down cold.
He asked God for wisdom when He offered him gold.
And there were other dark times for the Jewish race
When the innocent were persecuted for our faith.
But we owe a debt to all those who have died
To forever stand tall and face the world with pride,
So when ya kick this rhyme, you wanna sing it out loud.
You are the nation of our fathers.  Young Jews, be proud!
[music repeats to sudden ending.]

Upside Down 
I've been spending some time
Thinking il be alright
Don't know if I can really make it tonight
Lie awake in the dark
Calm down, then I'll start
Thinking about you
It's almost breaking my heart
I don't know where I went wrong
Or what's going on
Baby, I feel like our love lost  tonight
Should I stay, should I go
Well I really don't know
Lately I've been missing you so
Baby you don't understand
Our love lies lost but 
You're still holding my hand
Oh, and then you walk away
Just tonight, i want you to stay
You're turning me on
You turn me around
You turn my whole world upside down
You're turning me on
You turn me around
You turn my whole world upside down
Everytime I hurt you, well it's hurting me too
Don't know if I could really stay here tonight
Tired of thinking of you, and everything that you do
Tell me, what am I supposed to do
Well I just wanted to say that I need you today
Tell me, it's all gonna work out all right
I Don't know where I should start, but with all of my heart
Baby let me be your lover tonight
Baby you don't understand
Our love lies lost but 
You're still holding my hand
Oh, and then you walk away
Just tonight, i want you to stay
You're turning me on
You turn me around
You turn my whole world upside down
You're turning me on
You turn me around
You turn my whole world upside down
Oh..You know...you turn me upside down...

Amor Suicida 
Me encontr una chica en la plaza
Estaba llorando, yo no se por que
Tenia una petaca, de ginebra Bols
Y yo entonces, me acerque.... uh oohh
Hey hey hey

Y ella me conto todo su rollo personal.
Tenia un novio que se llamaba Antonio
Que habia muerto en la guerra de Malvinas... uh oohh
Hey hey hey

El tiempo corria y la petaca bajaba.
Ella me dio un beso y se despidio.
Camino unos pasos y un arma saco
Yo le pregunte: "nena que vas a hacer?"
No me respondio
Y el gatillo ella apret.

En el cielo o en el infierno para festejar
Te acordas cuando entramos alhospital Durand
A ver en la morgue a los fiambres,
El mejor recuerdo, es una simple cancin
Para alguien que ya no esta.
El mejor recuerdo, es una simple cancin

Y el pobre que muera.

No pod?a comenzar mejor
Pel?culas de amor y technicolor

Violencia en tu vestido

Te cre?ste la mujer maravilla
Tampoco me arrepiento
Ni digo que lo siento
Son romances en la l?nea amarilla
Ya cancele esta vida
Solo quiero salida de este
Mal romance.
No importa lo que digas
Tan solo quiero olvidar
Este...mal romance, vil romance
Bye bye nena
Todo esto es una pena
No se entienden tu emoci?n y la m?a
Ahora me reposo
Romance escandaloso
Y el romance lentamente se enfr?a
Crisis amorosa
Mediste cada cosa
Que muy pocos se imaginan en vos.
Muy mal entendidos
En juegos retorcidos
Que ganamos y perdimos los dos
Ya cancele esta vida
Solo quiero salida de este

Nosotros venimos de un barrio,

Tenemos algunos bares 
Con sus tipicos borrachos

pidiendo algo que morfar

So Confused 
Well I know we just met yesterday
But things feel oh so right
Cause you always know just what to say
And what is on my mind
Well I feel I need a special way
To ask you to be mine
But I dont know when's the perfect day
Or whats the perfect time
Babe you leave me confused
Dont know if I 
should let you know or wait it out girl
Wish I knew just what to do
Im so confused
(Chorus)
So girl what you wanna see
Wanna see me get down on my knees
Wanna hear me begging baby please
Wanna hear me crying for mercy
Oh girl I wish I knew your world
I think im losing my head over you
Every bone in my body says I want you tonight
Pretty little hunny, why you there by my side
With your Hale Berry face and you Beyonce thighs
With you Juxci want to collide
?
Bump all night long with you sexy little waist
Come girl, come along, 
wanna make love to you from dusk til dawn
Well I know that it maybe too soon 
to know just what you'd like
But I wana know what you've been thru, 
what you want from life
Its so real the way I feel so true, 
its been so hard to find
Wanna now how you feel for me too, 
so I can make up my mind
Babe you leave me confused
Dont know if I should let you know or wait it out girl
Wish I knew just what to do
I'm so confused
(Repeat Chorus)
Well someone once told me that you'd end up lonely
Dont let love ever pass you by
Coz I've seen it happen to people 
that mattered to me with my very own eyes
Maybe they were mistaken
And I should be waiting, for you to show me a sign
Or should I just let you know that if I let you go,
Id wonder the rest of my life
[Repeat Chorus]
To be or not to be, that is the question
I dont know what to do Im in a state of confusion
All I want from you is your love and affection
Is this love real or just an illusion?

Thinkin' About You 
(feat. Latoya, Miranda, Smoothe Da Hustler, Snow)
[Snow]
It was a lonely, long, and grimey night
I go to see my girl, my Madonna
I've been so lonely, I've been thinkin' 'bout you
[Latoya 
&
 Miranda]
It never fails, no matter what I do
I find myself locked up in thoughts of you
Over your kiss, I reminisce by sweet sunlight
And it's your titanic touch, that takes my mind at night
'Cause when I'm with you love is so real it's like sweet pain
Just the thought of you takes away the rain
There's nothing I'd rather do than keep you on my mind
Days are short enough, so I don't waste my time
Locked up in you, your love is true, what am I to do?
Wanna make this real, 'bout how I feel, boy what's the deal?
Your love is so real, you got me, you got me
[Chorus]
[Snow]
Hey, way-yo-yeah
Think about you all the time you go away
Hey, know what you say
Spend a little time with me
Get freaky, be your fantasy
Let's ride, let's ride, let's ride
[Smoothe]
Whoever wanna tangle better be ready to hang
I don't tie knots, why not? that ain't my thing (foo')
Catch me blazin' up in my whip, catchin' attitudes
When my flight's delayed, I flip, then I'm raisin' up
Pop the cork and, rearrange and stop your walkin'
The solo type with tigher game than dolomite
I got ya hopin' I stay around, I don't play around
When I rise, I lay it down, bless it and leave
I don't hang around, I'm too rude to be forgotten
You're feelin me right, boo?
That's what you get for stopin'
[Chorus]
[Latoya 
&
 Miranda]
In the middle of the night or broad daylight
Won't put up a fight
I'll just relax and let my thoughts take flight
While your honey rides control my world, 
boy, my mind 24-7
What can I do?
You know you've got that butter love
I'm thinkin' of, baby you stay on my mind
I'm so 'bout you
Oh, I'm captivated, I can't maintain it
I just don't know what to do
[Chorus]

You Give Me All I Need 
I'm sitting here babe thinking about you 
Staring at the wall, I don't know what to do 
Can you tell me where have you gone 
No answer on your telephone. Tell me what I've done 
You give me all I need and I can't live without you 
Tell me what I've done baby, tell me what I've done, 
Tell me what I've done
And you know what I feel, you turn me inside out 
Take a chance, make it real, you are all my life's about 
And I can't live without you 
You give me all I need and I can't live without you 
Pictures on the floor, the two of us 
And your eyes are blue, made me feel the trust 
Now the time is wrong to be alone 
All on my own, ................. it out go wrong 
Everytime I see you girl I get wicked 
So please don't leave me or else you wanna kick it 
The love we share is not the one to lose 
So don't be cruel and baby .................... choose 
I'm looking for your love, baby please be mine 
Come into my heart and let it shine 
I'd wait a million years and ...................... 
I don't care about, I wanna be with you

Everybodys singing out the demons in their heads, and theyre singing, who knew that love was so alone? I found your card in late December, now dont you remember when I was your everything? Its like you didnt have to try, I thought my eyes would never dry, I swear the rain that summer could have drowned the sun, this song reminds me of way back when, never thinking of when that was then, im slowly swallowing the sun and softly stuttering my speech, empty eyes cannot disguise the nothingness they see, im loosing sleep, this author is starved for new words, I swear I didnt really want to take this there but you left me with no choice and you got what you deserve

Alright its a trap but I changed my mind and now I want you back, I know you cant trust me but you should take my hand and hold your breath cause I can see the exit sign through the smoke, this fire baby it will burn us both alive, hold your breath (am I poetic enough for you? Cause im pathetic enough for you) todays another day with high hopes, another circus with high ropes, and an all-star cast that never chokes, and if the Harold angel was at your throat with a knife, I wouldnt sing to save your life, youd better get this through your head, were the drop outs, the dreamers, singers and screamers (the heart throbs with heartbreak), the outcasts and kids that you thought could never last (the misfits with hit lists), well never stop unless were dead, youd better get that through your head

Open your ears for the techno rap sing
Back on the track, no my name ain't Jack
You try to criticize, so now step back

Just let yourself go cause you're rolling with the real thing

Combine it with my own style, I ain't blind
One of a kind make sure I'll find
A way to gain and win cause it's the real thing
The music flows, I lay these rhymes
Time for some action, cause it's about time
Pay close attention, are you out, are you in?
'Cause if you roll, you're rolling with the real thing
[ANITA:] Searchin' for the real thing

And start up the party

We're not saying
We're better than you
Its just that you don't know shit
From shampoo
Were all punks or skins or rudes
Or whatever the fuck you claim you are
Turn the on our sound
And sing along in your car!!!
See, the music's all the difference
But the message is all the same

Was the cutest girl that I've ever seen
Walked up to her
Gave her flowers
Man, you should have seen the look

I asked her out
I though about
How great that this girl seems
I can't believe it
It's just so plain to see
I met the girl of my dreams.
GO!
She made my day
Thought about the way
She stole my fucking heart away.
What can I say
This girl is great
I went right home to masterbate.
This is all fate
We stayed up late
I can't even concentrate.
We seemed so tight
We talked all night
I can't believe it seemed so god damn right.
Girl of my dreams (x3)
We went out and
She seemed so great
Sex was the only thing to anticipate
Went back to my place
She's all in my face
The way her lips tasted was oh so great.
Should I care
Did it seem fair?
She went right for my underwear.
Then to my room
To do what I assume
Ended that perfect night with a boom.
Girl of my dreams (x3)
Then the truth came out
What she's all about
And how old
That she really is
Who she's been with
I can't believe it
Makes me fucking sick

Spend all your time in a bar

I'd better end up dead
Say that you are shaping us
For our future goals
Point us in the wrong direction
Selling off our souls
Say it's for our benefit
So that we will end up well
You can never make up
For 12 long years of hell
I can't believe you try to tell me
It's for my own good
Just because your life is screwed
Doesn't mean ours should
Say that you love your job
You're in it for the kids
Then why is it when you wake up
You wish you never did
Think you're doing us a favor
By coming to your class
Bitching at us about everything
Calling us selfish brats
We're the ones who are trapped
Inside this vacancy
If we try to speak our mind
To the principals office please
Being allowed to freely think
You know it's not allowed
There is no individuality
Start acting like the crowd
Threaten that you'll fail me
And that I'll flunk your class
We'll I'll tell you what to do
Shove that rule book up your ass
Thinking for yourself
Shouldn't be a crime
Teaching us useless stuff
Wasting all our time
Well if it were up to me
I'd burn it all to the floor
Then I'd do what I want
Can't waste my time anymore
Moral of this story
Don't let your life just waste
Do what you wanna do
You should choose your fate
If they try and hold you down
Don't put of with the shit
It is all your own life
It's how you deal with it

Riot At Taco Bell 
There was a riot at Taco Bell
Quite a tale in which I will tell
Smashed the windows
Broke the glass
Stupid Mexicans can kiss my ass.
Well I need some food
I need it fast
I got no money I'm driving around for something cheap
I see the sign a bit down the street
Pull into the parking lot
The open sign I did spot
Got out the car
All seems well
Soon there was a riot at the bell.
Walked into this place
Took a look around
Bunch of faggots everywhere
A chick could not be found.
Two would not stop staring
Told them they better quit
One just pissed us off
And the other said 'go eat shit.'
It had really made us mad
The fact that we had just been dissed
By a bunch of fags with ponytails
It made us fucking pissed off.
Riot at the bell (x3)
Stupid Spics, you burn in hell.
Ran up to them
Smashed their face
Blood was spewed all over the place
Teeth were broke
Noses were bashed
Threw one fag through the glass
Then we saw the Mexican's face
They were in a fucking daze
I don't know what to do now
Then they shouted blanco puetas!
Then they took a charge running right at us
Place was fucking screwed
That was all the fuss
They were really pissed
Place was fucking trashed
A faggot on the floor
Face was broken and bashed.
Standing in a daze
I did not know what to do
I took a look at the Oi boy
He didn't have a fucking clue!
So we got the hell out of there!!!
Riot!!!

Save The Animals, Eat Humans 
Born dead, innocence lost
A dining pleasure at their cost
Human race, so inconsiderate
Killing all the innocent
Take for granted, your precious life
Cutting another with a knife
What about man's best friend
In your stomach in the end
How can you say that it's ok
They're gonna die anyway
So what, doesn't meant that it's alright.
Top of the food chain, how's this?
You're worthless and they're helpless
Stupid trailer trash
Well here's, what I think
I say that we fucking shoot your ass
Stop and look, at the world
From a different point of view
Where you'd drag a bushy tail
Tell you exactly what you do
You would stop and wonder why
Innocent beings had to die
Sympathy they can't afford
Their happy little lives cut short
So eat a cow, or better yet
Why don't you consult your local vet?
Or how about the city morgue
All you can eat, a smorgas board
So wrap a life in a taco shell
Hope it fills you for your trip to hell
Society brings a tear to my eye
Our lives are shit, I wonder why?

Teletubbies Are Evil 
Children watching television used to be just fine
Teaching them to read and write, educating their mind
And then here comes a new show from the BBC
They sent out a plague to us, trashing all kids TV.
My body went into shock, my brain just got all numb
No good will ever come, from this evil foursome
I could not believe my eyes, when all things were looking well
Here come the Teletubbies, straight from the depths of hell

God, you suck
Can't believe you preach to me
Whine and cry
All the time
Tell us how our world should be.
Say your life is bullshit
How bad they all treat you
Well you don't know shit
About what your going through.
Take a step back and look at yourself
You're no better than me or anyone else.
Say your beliefs are the only ways
That are great
Our lives are hell
I guess it's just our fate.
You spread your hate.
This world is going to hell
And it's going there really fast
With your wonderful songs
I'm sure it will help it last
It's a horrible thing
All the angst driven strife
That's rotting up our world today
Why don't we all just get a life?
Take a step forward
And look at yourself
You were never better than me or anyone else.

There is nothing you can do about it

(Dammit, people, say "HEY!")
Hey! (x4)
Try to call you on the phone
Once again you're not at home
You say you love me for all time
You and I both know that's a lie
I hope you fucking die!
Use me, abuse me, tell me
What your idea of a relationship is supposed to be.
You hide it, deny it
I can tell your love for me has all been a bunch of shit.
Try to talk to you
Nothing ever gets through
Never hear a word I say
Ya get up and walk away
Do you really care?
The fact that I don't think it's fair
That you can get up and walk right out the door?
You're such a stupid whore!
Hey! I finally dump your ass
Put you in my past
No more cheating on me
I can finally let things be.
Then one summer day
You walked right in my way
Tears rolling from your eyes
Mistreated by a guy.
You came up to me
Looking for some sympathy
What a strange thing to do
What I am supposed to do?
Should I be real glad?
Maybe a little sad?
You've never been treated like this
Never once been dissed.
Thought about what to do
Should I be comforting you
Tears rolling from your eyes
Mistreated by a guy
Then I thought way back
When you put me down
Then I laughed at you and said
"Bitch, what comes around goes around."

Y que de ahora en adelante solo podre odiarlos

Do you know why you're here?
Do you know where you're going?
 Have another beer.
Can you tell who I am? 
Can you even stand up straight?
Can you tell what you look like, doing what you father hates?
And it's your attitude that's changed enough to make me feel this way.
It's hard to be your friend, when you're not you're friend.
Should I just pretend that you're the same?
It used to be so nice before you rolled the dice.
But soon you'll pay the price.

Started a whole new life
No stress somebody else

with all the pressure of 
nobody for the family
Well now i know
that god is always there with me
filling my life with everything i need
so we'll wake up tomorrow
and i'll forget some idol
to be a real man
i remember when i used to go out and play 
(now its like nobody in the world thinks my way)
and now we know that things will never be the same
no they will never be the same
and i dont want to grow up
deal with all that stuff
always breakin me down
take me back when i was there
and everyone was my friend
i didnt even know what a job was
no stress to worry about
no problems to figure out
it just seems to be that life is so easier then
so i am a father
have to raise a daughter
who i love so much
i remember when i used to go out and play 
(now i cant help it nobody in the world thinks my way)
and now we know that things will never be the same

Go go go go go go go on cuz, it's my birthday
We're gonna party like it's my birthday
We're gonna do a yardie like it's my birthday
And you know s'all sweet it's not my birthday!
CHORUS
You'll find me in the pub, you won't find me in the club
I'm into drinking piss and I'm into rolling buds
I'm into sexy chicks - I ain't into you cuz
So come give me a hug if you've got some nice jugs!
VERSE 1
When I pull up out front you'll see the Ute outside
Take Old Mai Road so I can drink and drive
I came to see the game, I came to check out Jonah
I won't stop the flaggings til the games over
I knew the odds and beat them; 'canes Up, Blues down
I won a hundie bucks  Yo cuz it's my round!
When I make my move, try to pull a fly honey
I buy her a shandy with whats left of my money
Back in Palmy chicks are all like "Ooh Ooh 20 ya hot!"
But most of them are dogs I'm like "Nah, you're not"
But up in Aucks the flash dudes all reckon I'm crazy
Coz I gets too pissed then acts real shady
Feelin focused now - got the honey on my mind
She was talking to her mates so I grabbed her behind
I asked her if she wanted to go back to my Wharae
She turned around and stabbed me in the eye with her durry
CHORUS
You'll find me in the pub, you won't find me in the club
I'm into drinking piss and I'm into rolling buds
I'm into sexy chicks - I ain't into you cuz
So come give me a hug if you've got some nice jugs!
You'll find me in the pub, you won't find me in the club
I'm into sinking piss and I'm into rolling buds
I'm into sexy chicks - I ain't into you cuz
And I've got 5 bucks love if you let me see your jugs (idiotic laugh)

What do you mean I'm not allowed in here?
Whats wrong with my shoes? I got these at the warehouse bro
Whats your problem?

My Ute, my chrome, my tubs, my sounds
20 Cent from the block and I ain't changed

You should love it, way more then I hate it
I'm like "What up?" and they say my starter cap is outdated
Theres some dude by the bar - trying to eye me up right?
I'm like "Shiny pants homo-you looking for a fight?"
Turns out he's got some mates who'd give me a thumpin
Get me thrown out of the pub - but I'm still pumpin
Down the Servo for a pie "Oh shit they all burned!"
Dude says they half price
Oh sweet I ain't concerned!
Girl says "Big Boy, theres a good time at my place"
I'm thinking yup, then I see stubble on her face
I'm heading home to Palmy, sick of the big lights
Girls end up as guys and I end up in fights!
CHORUS
You'll find me in the pub, you won't find me in the club
I'm into drinking piss and I'm into rolling buds

Greet The Machine 
has it ever occured to you the machine's too perfect? 
peek-a-boo big brothers watching you, 
a thousand eyes on the world connects too one who rules the overview 
yet we hide in our homes and worship the screen day by day, 
our essence slips away 
the more we trust the machine 
(chorus): 
I'd rather face the peril! 
then join the sheep and greet the machine 
I'd rather face the peril! 
then wear your mark and be safe and clean 
I'd rather face the peril! 
then take your words and praise the regime 
I'd rather face the peril! 
then join the sheep and greet the machine 
on a roll, more corporate mind control, 
more families marching to the songs of the piper who will eat them whole 
and in the end our salt will lose all its taste, 
we'll be laid to waste, 
the day they buy the rights to clone a new human race 
(repeat chorus)
erase....erase....no!

The machines too perfect?

You're so ugly
When I look at you
I go out of my mind

At someone's behind
You make the children scream
And baby's cry
With your crusty teeth
And your blood shot eyes

You're so ugly
No matter what you wear
Your face doesn't matter
I don't think you were born
You had to be hatched

Gets one hell of a scare
They can't fall asleep
Cause your a walking nightmare

Today I wish I have a plan.
A blueprint drawn out to save the day.
I'll drive my car right through these walls.
We'll sit back and watch it fall apart.
Today I'll never feel the same.
Never forget that we're five years away.

Barely Breathing 
Barely breathing, watching the sky
I'm slowly waiting for an answer
I woke up to find the things I'm searching for will never make me human
Black skies circle,
I have to take control
I have to break the cycle
If one thing confines me,
I have to blame myself there's no one left to blame but me
The truth can ruin lives,
The truth can ruin everything
I'm looking forward now,
I'm forgetting everything
I hope I have the heart to try and fail
I have received this life and I'll defend it with valor
I have received this life and I can't take it for granted
How can we live destined to fail when I can barely breath
We have a choice, it's in our hands
Will we stand firm or will we wilt with age
These thoughts have plagued me for so long
That I've confused my thoughts for reality
We search for things we can't attain
Money kills status fades and when we wake up we'll be dead

With every choice with every single action there's a consequence
There is a price that must be paid.
You're running out of time.
You're running out of time.
The sun will collapse and destroy your world
What can I say?
Everything you strive for, really means nothing.
The higher you climb the that ladder the further you get from yourself
The higher you climb, the more you destroy yourself.
There is no sympathy for those that blind their eyes.
There is no sympathy, there is a price that must be paid.

Time... The greatest enemy of all.
Why? Why do we waste all our time? Why?

This thigns will only enslave us.

King's Vengeance 
Down and out in the city
Won't you give a boy a break?
Juvenile on trial before committee
Taken all he can take
Taken all he can take
But the king shall have his vengeance
Especially on the poor
Some say preaching to convert him
But me I'm not too sure
Spring she comes and spring she teases
Brings summer winds and summer breezes
Blow through your hair till autumn leaves us
And when autumn leaves oh how winter freezes
And the child is still breathing
With the beating of his heart
Some say we are equal
Some a million miles apart
But the king shall have his vengeance
While the Queen she represents the innocent
And the child so dependent
But the seasons conquer all
Spring she comes, spring she teases
Brings summer winds and summer breezes
Blow through your hair till autumn leaves us
And when autumn leaves, oh how winter freezes
But the king shall have his vengeance
Especially on the poor
Some say preaching to convert him
Me I'm not so sure

Finally
I get the chance to say these words to you
From me
I've got to find a way to live
To love again
Constantly
I get reminded of the pain, the truth
That hurts
Oh, how my heart believes that day
I laid her to rest
The darkest day, the longest night
I can't perceive it'll be all right now
But I've found a way
These eyes can't cry
I've seen it all before
My love is gone
I've got to find an open door
Patiently
I've been waiting for this time to fade
To end, yes
Well could I ever look to you
To fill this empty space
The darkest day, the longest night
I can't perceive it'll be all right now
But I've found a way
These eyes can't cry
I've seen it all before
My love's still gone
I've got to walk the lonely road
These eyes can't cry
I've seen it all before
My soul is gone
I've got to find an open door
We danced the nights away
Face to face and again we played
We thought we had it made but
I can't say, watch the flame
Burn, in turn to fade
These eyes can't cry
I've seen it all before
My love's still gone
I've got to walk that lonely road
These eyes can't cry
I've seen it all before
My soul is still gone
I've got to find an open door
These eyes
These eyes
My love
My love, my love
These eyes
No, they can't cry
I've seen it all before

Do you know what tommorrow brings
And where it goes from there?
I would say that it's sad to think
There's nothing left
Around the bend
Close my eyes, crawl inside
Try to find shelter from this life
And if I try
With all my might
I just might find the answers
If you can't see, can you still be
Existent, Ordinary ?
You try to dream but you can't sleep
No, its never ending

Stagnant you can't win this race

Bona Fide Push Over 
I am alone and feeling deprived
Maybe it's because I don't know what's inside
Of my heart, and in my mind
When all my thoughts are kept inside
Some of my thoughts deal with death
But most deal with happiness
Of a girl that I can see
But she's not here next to me
Once I thought of a time
When everything was fine
And everyone just liked me
For trying to be me
So now I am alone
With no one to call my own
Thinking of the time that has passed
Which could have been a real blast
I always thought way too hard
About problems people face in everyday life
I know thinking too much is not good for you
But when you are lonely its something to do

But your no jewel
Its just high school and your fake.

can you tell me, when was the last time you really laughed?
I feel you need to escape
She said "stir me up, just a bit" well lets quit our jobs and then dye our hair green
She said" Stir me up, just a bit." well lets count the stars and give each one a name
Your life has been swirled around
and parents got your confidence down
leaving you to feel trapped in dismay
come along and take your shoes off
you're as powerful as you become
and tonight's your night to prowl and scowl to forget
can you tell me...when was the last time you really laughed?
I feel you need to escape
She said" stir me up, just a bit." well lets slash our tires and drive around in the rain
She said" Stir me up, just a bit." well lets drink till laughter drowns out our pain
yeah lets romp around and brag about our fame
yeah lets count the stars and give each one a name....

Shutting Down 
I'm shutting down(8x)
I've got more then I could ever give
I've got reasons I can not live with 
Open, follow, -I'm your leader now
Blame me but don't save me
I'm dross and running out (my domain)
They contacted me, "X" marks the spot where they beat me inside   
Falling inline, I pull my tail between my legs
Pick up the pieces, To fall back in pieces (hot room)    
I need a vacation
I've got more than I could ever give
I've got reasons I can not live with
Dollar bills flow
Spilling out my brains
Not this, I don't want thisYou can have your bloody champagne!!!!(capital gain)

Straight Circle 
Fork in the road
is it a smile or is it a frown
that depends on how I see it
well I've been feeling up
I've been feeling upside down
take this time and watch it make a man insane
oh no
first big footstep off this carousel
not something why should question today
gotta get out, but how do I start moving when everyone and everything factors in
"one fast move or I'm gone"(jack karouac)..I couldn't be more like you.
a nomad in his straight circle again 
insufficient self-esteem
I'm on the low end of my jubilance
there's a pot of gold I see it
wishing well.....well what you're saying to me is sounding too intense..

Where Are You Now 
I see your face, only in a bleaching picture
where the sun has shown the years gone bye
I walk alone, up and down familiar streets
where I turn around before I sigh
it makes me wonder,
where have the years taken you?
I find myself wanting to do the things we do
because you were my fun
you were my number one
and it makes me wonder
where are you now
hand in hand
together we would stand
and it makes me wonder
where are you now? 
I heard your voice when I opened an old letter
that same old spark went off inside
imagining you with me
walking down that same blue coastline
you always found that spark in my life....where are you now?

I'm Sorry 
[Verse 1:]
I know I said it, I know I did it,
maybe I went overboard to prove a point.
But sometimes my pride gets in the way,
maybe I need some time away to get my head together.
(Maybe this was my last chance)
(I don't ever want to take it for granted)
(I can say that I'm a better man, I'm sorry).
[Chorus:]
I'm so sorry that I chose to walk away from You,
and I'm sorry if I turned Your love away.
I didn't mean to take Your words 
and make them seem so trite,
I sincerely, completely apologize for doing what I did.
[Verse 2:]
Everything You taught me and everything You showed me,
it never seemed that I would listen to anything.
But You've got my attention, more than You know,
I took it in, I dealt with it, but I waited too late to use it.
(Maybe this was my last chance)
(I don't ever want to take it for granted)
(I can say that I'm a better man, I'm sorry).
[Chorus]
[Bridge:]
I've never, ever been so shameful for what I did,
but You made me know one thing 
(that I should have never did).
Will You please take me back again,
I never wanted to burn this bridge.
(If I could do it all over again),
I'll never mishandle You ever again.
[Chorus]

Power Of Christ 
I thought I had the best in life. I had friends and I had things 
I thought I was doing ok on my own until I lost it all. 
I thought that I had real joy in possessions of this world 
Until that day I met you and told me about the Power of your love 
The power grace the power of your nail scarred hands that changed eternal fate. 
The power of you blood the power of your word the power of you life in me to make me free today. 
The power of your love the power of grace the power of your nail scarred hands that change eternal fate. 
The power of your blood the power of your word the power of you life in me that makes me free today. 
You came to earth so that I can be free. 
Every burden I had you lifted off me. 
You gave the ultimate sacrifice You shed your blood you gave me life. 
Now all this pain my eyes can see my heart has turned and its chases after thee so I denounce myself and things so I can be like you. 
The power of your love the power of grace the power of your nail scarred hands that change eternal fate. 
The power of your blood the power of your word the power of you life in me that makes me free today

Out of bounds slipping fucking with this hood rat
My homeboy told me that the bitch wasn't shit
But I didn't give a fuck cuz this twin a Crip
The first young nigga with a baseball cap
Tried to hit a nigga up until he seen how we strut
I'm like 'Nigga, take two steps back
now lower your voice before you get pimp slapped'
I know you seen me on your MTV raps
Way back in the days when I was with Fab' Five Freddy
I told you then, I told you now, boy I stay ready
Don't sweat it, we'll get him and then met him
Talk shit for a minute then deal with him
Hail Mary, call Makavelli to come and save your ass
Cuz I'ma put my Chucks up in it so quick and so fast
You use some act-right like LaBetty
and let you know that I'm the king of this motherfucking city
Like Frank White, Nino Brown, John Gotti, Tony Soprano
Joey Banana and the great Tony Montana
All of 'em mixed in one fixed to done
I like playing six-to-one
This is fun, shooting my guns, counting my funds
and walking on you bitch niggaz that run

Still from the Beach, still a g thang

We came to party homie, so back up
Plus up in the club, y'all don't have a body

Difference is my bullets probably touch the sun
Want some? Come and get it
On your marks, get set, blah!
That's coming with it
They won't stop, they'll get it, you don't get it
It don't stop, still dont love bitches

If you feel me raise your cups (East Side, Long Beach)

And we from

Smooth motherfucker when it come to these hos
All damn dimes up in every area codes
Gangsta shit, yep and all the hos know

Made a promise to pay, but never paid her

Wherever we go, she gon' go
[Chorus]

Absolutely 
[Snoop Dogg]
Me and Nate Dogg were so funky fresh
We fell off into a club to try to pop it to Daz
A lil' Moet to go with the way I'm dressed
A seven-piece outfit with a mink vest
Couple of ladies skating waiting on some info
Them white boys in the back got the indo
With a hookup, a hundredd dollars for a half ounce
I got to hit it, get it and bounce
So right back to the place that I started from
Get back hell yeah I'm hardly done
Write that on your motherfucking izzass
So hold up your glass and let's make a lil' tizoast
We brag and boast, zig-zag and smoke and keep a big bag of dope
We hold down the VIP wherever we sit
Nigga don't get mad if your ho with me
[Nate Dogg]
I'm not absolutely positive or absolutely sure
I'm not out to talk bad about your baby
I'm just tyring to be completely sure
You wanna hang with us, gotta hang with us
Take ya ass to the floor
I'm trying to game a bit, sound rediculous
Hope the ho is not yours
[Snoop Dogg]
Dancing and wining and dining a bitch
We humping bumping and grinding the shit
Nothing else to do now but to leave the club
so we can rub-a-dub-dub in my nigga Nate hot tub
Then we can grub on some barbeque
that my Uncle Rio hooked up, so call your crew
10, 11, 12, or 13, all of them bitches they belong to her team
It's so supreme you love my scheme
The way I got baby bringing Daddy all the cream
Yep, and that's the first step
And once you get that, nigga ya got that?
Pump that shit and fill up my cup and mack that bitch with the big ol' butt
Don't play with it - sway with it
And if it's cool with you, shit you know I'm okay with it
[Chorus - Nate Dogg]
Right back, baby girl I know you like that
You try to hide it but you get
Right back, come on over for a nightcap
Yes even though I'm with the right trap
Tell your man that you'll be right back
Even though we only just met
Make sure you don't forget the Jim' pack
I'm not absolutely positive or absolutely sure
I'm not out to talk bad about your baby
I'm just tyring to be completely sure
You wanna hang with us, gotta hang with us
Take ya ass to the floor
I'm trying to game a bit, sound rediculous
Hope the ho is not yours
[Chorus]
[Warren G]
Shouts out to the thugs that be back in the club
And of course lil' mama who be backing it up
We be the ones back in the Cut' smoking
Cognac in the cup, we be stroking
After the club, same routine, roll two 13s
Since her front clean yahknowimean?
Tight jeans, ice bling, no ring, no thang
Show off, show her Nate can sing
Show her how my team do our thi-dang
And how we keep Latrell Sprewells sprinning
I'm all hood so the Chucks stay on
It's all good we can do it 'til the break of dawn

Another Summer 
(feat. Latoiya Williams)
[Snoop Dogg]
A pool party at the church
G'd up and others barbequeing
Ain't no telling what your daddy and your momma doing
Chewing on these baby-backs popping bottles with these macks
Everybody swimming, backyard full of women
I'm entertaining folks
Gave the lil' homie twenty dollars just to shine my hundred spokes
Coke with the Hennesey tends to be the remedy
Family and friends to me
Everyone pretends to be kin to me
I can't wait until the Fourth of July
to pop some fireworks with my kids
and fly some kites high in the sky
See, it's the family reunion
And down at the church house, they giving up the annual communion
It seems we made it to another summer
Yeah we came and come up
213 is more than friends
Yeah, we like blood brothers
Riding this 'til the wheels fall off
Can you dig that?
We got this summertime anthem for y'all
We did that
[Chorus - Latoiya Williams]
We made it through winter
We made it through fall
We made it through the spring time
Tough times and all
It's good to see
I love the summer
I'm riding with the top down
Let the wind blow
Chillin' with my love
Partying fo' sho'
It feels good to see
I love the summer
Everybody if you with me sing
[Nate Dogg]
We got the game on lock
On the paper chase, can't stop
On a roll, still hot
Gotta be top notch
I like the girls 'cuz they hot
Plus I know what they want
They want the game that we got
Hold up baby girl I think not
I like the nasty girls from around the way
Hoppin' in my gray drop-top Mercedes
Shouts go out to my sexy ladies
Just in case your man is hating
Tell your boy he better chill (Summertime)
Tell your boy he better chill (Summertime)
[Chorus]
[Warren G]
I'm addicted to the sunshine the way it make these women dress
Tank tops, flip flops, make this nigga love the west
Different spots, even though different, it's still crackin'
In Jamaica, Queens I sit back, live and collect the cabbage
It's an affair that every state can relate to
And if you do what I do, then go on and follow suit
From Chi-Town to Diego, all the way back to NY
Stay fly, and never miss a piece of sunshine
When I'm at the church I barbeque for my kinfolk
Watch lil' Elijah and lil' Warren run the football
Got weed, got drink, but most of all the spirit
And it's a blessin' that the world wanna hear our music
The summer is an inspiration as much as the fast
And to my my nigga Snoopdewoop, I love you fam'
[Snoop Dogg]
Riding this 'til the wheels fall off
Can you dig that?
We got this summertime anthem for y'all
We did that
[Chorus]
[Snoop Dogg]
Yeah, another summer
Kanye West good looking on the beat, nephew
213 reminding y'all put your guns down
Well spent summertime, let's enjoy ourselves
We just wanna celebrate
You know what I'm talking about?
It's too hot for all that
Yeah 213
Moving mountains y'all haha
All the time, yeah

Appreciation 
[Warren G]
213
Childhood homies way back in the day
since then it's been 213 the hard way
Rapping on the street corners, young as can be
All the local groups called us Run-DMC
Me? Warren G, I was Jam Master Jay
Mixed with my big brother Dr. Dre
Now I got shouts to say
We still want Eazy like bedstyle people, we want Biggie
In memory of Tupac, Left Eye, Aaliyah
Heaven sent, say hi to my mama when you see her
Rest in peace but let's take it back to the streets
With so much drama in the LBC
It's kind of hard being a G from 213
Times was hard for a superstar
But don't nobody notice who you are
We worked hard and stayed true to the game
Kept faith, kept God and now you know our name
[Chorus - Nate Dogg]
A big shout out to all my family and friends
When times got hard, you were still be there
You give me inspiration like strength from the sun
Feel like destiny's son, yeah
[Snoop Dogg]
To be a rapper was my dream
And have a lot of money and live like a king
To have a handful of rings
And to make the kind of music that the whole world sings
Battle rap was the thing
And King Park was the spot where all the homeboys hang, bang
Just to go do our thang and form my gang
And took off white a white boy in a van to get our change
And moms knew what time it was
And loved the way her baby boy came up, Cuz
It's before I was Snoop Dogg on TV
I'm talking about when I was like a little bitty BG
Nigga me and Warren Gizzy and Nate Dizzy and Fatey Baby
are talking about eighty-threezy, flip the clock up to '93
And watch me rock the clock nonstop constantly
on MTV and BET whatever you want
Hit these niggaz with that motherfucking cheese (G-Funk)
Funk to shake ya trunk nigga from the bottom bunk
Now I'm moving on up, straight living it up
Well known in the zone and I'm still homegrown
Like Al B Sure, shit I'm on my own
But there's one thing I'm missing and that's family
Cuz without y'all I don't know where I'd be
[Chorus]
[Nate Dogg]
There's no way I can forget about you
Support for me, your love for me
Your prayers for me when I'm in these streets
And there's no way I can forget to thank ya
For showing me the true meaning of unconditional love ooohhh
When I be fucking up you always come with love
You say you've had enough
I just wanna thank ya
Yeah yeah yeah
I just wanna give
[Chorus]
<BREAK>

Gotta Find A Way 
[Nate Dogg]
Funny how time flies
Funny how one thing leads to another
Funny how mothers cry
Funny how we live at night and in the gutter
Funny how cash rules everything around me
Funny how people never seem to change
Funny how my closest friends is my rebuttal
Seems like it all can change and I can get paid
Whoa!
[Chorus - Nate Dogg]
Nigga gotta find a way
Find a way to make some money
Nigga gotta find a way
Find a way to make some cash
Got to find a way
Nigga gotta find a way
Find a way to make some money
Nigga gotta find a way
Find a way to make some cash
Got to find a way
[Warren G]
I was giving this a lot of thought
Should I trip? Should I not? Should I set this off?
A whole lotta pressure is on my shoulders
My soul is with all my niggaz I roll with; so know this
Cut the bullshit, take it back to the music
use it right, don't matter what you do with it
I'm here to represent the real
I still stayed G'ed up unless must I will
I stayed up all night, I argue and fight by myself; this can't be right
Hmm cuz if the lights were the sound of the siren
I'd make you niggaz get a deal and act wild
I'm for real and I can see through these suckers that dick riding motherfuckers
Yeah, that's me bustin' cuz I'm a huslter for the chips
And I'm trippin 'cuz I'm sick of this shit
Listen
[Snoop Dogg]
It wasn't about money up front
All a nigga wanted was a big gold chain and a blunt
Why? What do you mean?
Living my Auntie Mary and I ain't having a damn thang
I can't get a job; I might as well steal and rob
Man, life is so hard
Hanging in my homie garage while other niggaz
doing killing for a living in the city of stars
I got a lick but I ain't got caught
Nigga slippin' leaving a sack by the bar
And I seen where he set it, thought he had hid it
Nope, and I'm about to go get it
Come up, I gotta stay run up
Left eye open while I'm sleep with the gun up
Please don't run up about that money I'm funny
My nigga you'll get done up
[Chorus]

Groupie Luv 
[Intro: Snoop Dogg]
This is a DJ Whoo production
In conjunction with Doggystyle Records and 213
[Verse 1: Warren G]
I need a ride or die groupie that can get dirty in Gucci
On the floor or the floor or the hoopty while she loving me up
I'm usually the instigator
But ain't nothing greater
Than a X-rater with a nickname like vibrator
I need to do a remix to "Area Codes"
I..got..hoes and plenty more
The way it kicks on time is out of control
So when my nigga Snoop Dogg comes and kicks the door
[Snoop Dogg]
When I walk up in the door
You best to know it's pimping on the whole
213 gets the crunk for sure
And they know about us everywhere we go
[Warren G]
And where the groupies at
[Chorus: Nate Dogg 
&
 (Snoop Dogg)]
I was just about to call
'Till Snoop Dogg told me that he boned
'Till Warren G told me he rolled
(I told you she's a grooouuuppp)
Hoooooeeeee!!!
Nate Dogg in the house tonight looking for some groupie love
Snoop Dogg in the house tonight looking for some groupie love
Warren G in the house tonight looking for some groupie love

Groupie Love
[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Looking for a chick
That love that West Coast gangster shit
Yeah girl if you think that you're the one
Let's go and have ourselves some fun
You ain't got a bring nothing at all
Just enjoy the adventures of the Dogg
I heard you like my smile
My rap, my pimp, my style
Well it's on you what it do
You got to let Nate hit it too
'Cus when we come to your town
Rule is pimps up, draws down
[Warren G]
And where the groupies at
[Chorus]
[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
My fast scheme on them
We can tag team on them
That's what we need to do
Just me, G and you
It's cool when I'm seeing you
Get ready for a nine inch dick, me and the D in you
I know you don't want to miss this
Some classic LBC, 213 shit
We in your city get busy 'till you get dizzy
Trying to find all our fans
To load them up in our vans
[Warren G]
We hate to end the show
But there's a lot of groupies at the door
Another everyone to take a see
All aboard and launch 213
And where the groupies at

Joystick 
[Nate Dogg]
She said she wants to ride my joystick
She act like she wanna ride my joystick
[Warren G]
I got it lock when it comes to females
Y'all niggaz still buyin' cock at retail
It's a gift that keeps giving to all hos
Like that lil country whore I fucked a day ago
We were in Spokane but made it to Diego
Droppin' shit purposely lettin' her thong show
She didn't even know about a nigga mandingo
When she saw the joystick and wouldn't let go
She ain't playin' games, she want it right now
From the living room floor to the ouside patio
Bent over gently, I was proud to embrace it
Firmly grab it, rapidly get it crackin'
Most women I know, love the joystick
And love playing with it when it goes the extra inch
I'm a pro, anything goes at the spot
If you know about it, then be about it
If not..
[Chorus - Nate Dogg]
She said she wants to ride my joystick
She wants to ride, she wants to ride
She act like she wanna ride my joystick
She wants to ride, she wants to ride
[Nate Dogg]
She wanted me, every part
But all I really want is dinner
Her company, at least at first
But now I wanna go up in her
While I'm hittin corners in my Chevrolet
I ran into a honey from around the way
Big Nate Dogg what can I say?
She asked for my number and some    Alize
I got game, so I spit some game
She lookin' at me all in my face
She must recognize Mister Gangsta Nate
Baby wants to give it to me
[Chorus]
[Warren G]
When Mom's on rock I stay on top
Lock up like pits in a box I can't stop
Not cuz your beauty it's your booty that I'm attracted
Want to get acquainted, most acquainted with your assets
Roll with the best, yes my joystick
Tasty in all kinds of ways, you'll see
I'm a pro, anything goes at the spot
If know about it, then be about it
Cuz if not..
[Nate Dogg]
I bet she comin' home with me
She wants to come home and play with me
No fallin' in love with me
Can't spend the whole week with me
No sittin' up front with me
For the whole damn world to see
She wants to show me she's a freak
She only wants to sleep with me
[Chorus 2x]
[Snoop Dogg]
Yeah baby you said you don't know nothing about video games
But you know a whole lotta about joysticks, huh?
It's like Xbox and EA Sports
It's in the game, you dig?
So if you shift it from first gear to third gear
Just make sure you grab a hold of those two things up under
You know what I'm talking about?
Yeah, bizzalls, real talk
It's one of them joysticks that you could just
You know, slip n' slide to
Yeah you could ride to this
Real talk
213 comin' at you once again
For the 2000 plus 4
[BEEP]
You what up, this is Big Snoop DOgg
If this call is about bullshit, borrowing money from me
or negativity, hang up right now and call 9-1-1
Cuz I can't do nothing for you right now
But if it's a real call and a real conversation
Leave your name and number at the bizeep
And I'll get back like that

Keep It Gangsta 
Keepin' it gangsta
Niggaz and niggettes
Keepin' it gangsta
Niggaz and niggettes
[Warren G]
I was raised in the church but spent more days raised in the turf
And crime pays so I spent my days on the search
Parade with a smirk, fresh fade with a church
Nextel wave alert, renegades about the dirt
Hurt the fresh white t-shirt, that's when we skirt
These jerks ain't trying to flirt with the fellas
Besides, these rappers ain't doing no telling
Bailing with an attitude and that ain't nothing
and ain't no telling if dude gonna blast you
But got it confused, I break rules, take nothing from fools
I make it so that there's something gon' move
I move slow, bowguard the 'do low
Hit the Sillabard in a blue '64
Sitting kind of low in everywhere we go
We keeping it gangsta and that's for sho'
Come on!
[Nate Dogg]
It's that gangsta music that they adore
All the gangstas take the floor
When we step on stage, all the ladies scream for more
It's that gangsta music that they adore
All the gangstas take the floor
When we step on stage, all the ladies scream for more
[Nate Dogg]
My sister's cousin's told me
Her sister heard some stories
We were so gangsta growing up
We got the girls excited
Sluts up front just give their bodies
Take them straight to the after party
Two homeboys in the closet hiding
Ain't no fun if they can't ride it
I can't be faded
I'm a nigga from the motherfucking streets
Trump tight and you can't deny it
Fuck up everyone who's tried it
I remember when it started
Seems like yesterday morning
Blame it on us, yeah we did it
Took 'em probably got gangsta with it
[Chorus]
[Snoop Dogg]
Real flow, this is steel-toed biscuits
213 yeah we on that pimp shit
Mix in with some Crip shit, that's how it's scripted it
Bag it up, sack it up, give it to your dips
and bring me half back
I'm trying to get some spinners for that brand new Cadillac
Ride with me, roll with me, slipping down the runway doing about 450
I'm living the jet, clearing the deck, steering a 'Vette
You bitch niggaz ain't hearing me yet
So I pull out my hollow with heaters
Pop 'em and bleed 'em you niggaz better follow the leader
Skippity we boop we rock scooby doo
What would life be nigga without Big Snoop?
Don't trip cuz I'ma always G for y'all
Hate on the law and LBC on ya dog
[Chorus]
[Snoop Dogg]
Yeah
It's 213, 213
Yeah it's 213
Yeah it's 213
Yeah we all so G for real

Lil' Girl 
[Nate Dogg]
Lil' girl from the ghetto
Ran away from home
She ran away from home (Nananana)
Tried to be a fucking woman
Acting way too grown (Tooo grown, whoa whoa)
Then she ran across the border
Homie, 24-inch chromes (24-inch chromes nananana)
Now she walking down the track, stripping
With them brand new high heels on (Hahaha good God)
[Warren G]
She too young for me so I passed her to the next dude
Got hood fame, what a shame what X' do
Hang with a crew that love getting revenue
With a description of 1972
Now who's the mack in the 'Lac leaning to the side
24s gleaming, sitting up high?
Ride and won't die but you young bitch
Spit words so fly, get you sprung, bitch
Young Slick, his name, chasing Don Juan fame
Trying to replace him with modern day game (We don't hate)
Then shoot if you mess with his prostitute
And what I hear, he got a lot to shoot
Now what if dude get your crew Slick got one too?
Don't let the pimpin' fool you, he got hot ones too
Blew his brains out, now he catching chain out to Chino's
Slick got caught up fucking with a young dogg
[Snoop Dogg]
My nigga Slick was a gangbang motherfucking lunatic
Nigga out to get a grip, sworn in to do this shit
Nigga only do this shit and make this shit official
A little bitty nigga quick to hit you with the pistol
Ain't no motherfuckers squabbin' me, and that's on 20s
Plenty niggaz felt the wrath of his deuce-deuce gun blast
Ask Cuz on the corner with the bullet holes his chest blast
Dumb-dumb don't want come test
Cuz he'll lay you to rest, tattooed with a set on his neck
Demanding respect, Crip or die, is how he ride
Long Beach, East Side roll in two times
Every nigga on the yard know Cuz' rep
A straight gangsta for life, and I love that
It's not just a job, fool it's a lifestyle
And when you're slipping, woo-wam-lights-out
[Nate Dogg]
Lil' boy from the ghetto
You're greased up khaki's on (Nananana)
Used to be a ball player, homie
What the fuck went wrong? (Whoa whoa)
Used to see him on the corner daily
Hand up on his throne (Ahh yeah nananana)
Tried to knock him off a bank recently
25 to life, so long, he gone

Lonely Girl 
[Chorus - Nate Dogg]
Wait a minute, lonely girl
They try to warn me
They say you're horny
Eager to give it up
Take a minute, lonely girl
I'll be your daddy
Be what you wanna be
Be sure and give the cheddar to me
[Warren G]
She so sweet, so young
But she so sprung on the fast life
Whilin' out in public, subject thump about the past life
Maybe that's why she don't act right
So quick, so fast to fight
over dick that her mother probably did last night
Despite the dead beat daddy
And daughter don't listen, get her ass beat badly
It's so sad when my sisters get turned out
And we get mad when they ass get burned out
They ain't learned about an asswhoopin' down south
That we used to get over Grandmama's house
Open your mouth get popped right in it
And this without a doubt, it don't stop, she ain't finished
You know the business
Switches don't raise too many fast bitches
Now I'm all up in that ass bitches
[Chorus]
[Snoop Dogg]
It's chilly outside I had to grab my meat
Stop and think, lil' mama get your daddy a drink
I know you can't wait to shake and hit the gate on the dank
To hit the roll with these real ones and play or skate
Nate, told you the "Game Don't Wait"
I can't believe you sit at home with the frown on your face
It's so young, it's so cute
It's so us, it's so me, it's so you
It's so we, it's on me, it's on you
It's like the 1 and the 3 with no 2
It just don't sound like it just don't feel good
It just don't sound right, you hardly ever understood
It's the big homie, yep the one and only
No need to be sad and lonely
Just phone me whenever you need a lil' company
You so company especially when you humpin' me
Wait a minute, take a minute, think about it
[Chorus]
[Nate Dogg]
I thought I was through with you
Thought that you'd be long gone
I should have knew that you wouldn't be lonely long
From day one my paper grew with you
How can I get through to you?
I'm a hustla and I want it all
I thought I was through with you
Thought that you'd be long gone
I should have knew that you wouldn't be lonely long
From day one my paper grew with you
How can I get through to you?
I'm a hustla and I want it all

Mary Jane 
[Chorus - Nate Dogg]
One for the treble, two for the bass
She's my beauty queen, she's my everything
When I wake up in the morning gotta get that thing
This is where I wanna be with Mary Jane (sweet Mary Jane)
Ooooooo Mary Jane
Ooooooo Mary Jane
[Warren G]
Mary Jane, you are my everything
I'm in love with you
Now I realized why Rick James fucked with you
Since I said "I Do" I never cheated on you
Even when your sister-sis came through
I ain't trying to stress you
Cuz everytime I call, baby doll you be at my rescue
I can't sweat you
We just homie loving friends
Besides, I heard you fucking Snoop Dogg again
[Snoop Dogg]
G-Dub, that's my bitch, how the fuck she gon' love me?
I love that bitch, why the fuck you gon' leave me?
I'm in the green room and I'm fucking up the scenery
With my nigga Buddy Love blazing up some sticky burns
Yeah we go hit it 'cuz, have a seat and drink with us
Puff, puff, pass that shit
Smoke it all down to the ashes bitch
213 with another classic hit
[Nate Dogg]
I'm in love with Mary Jane
She is my main thang
Stay away from hooka smokes
She gives me headdaches man
And when my sack gets low
Sweet Mary swings on by
Breaks me off something proper
?That bowl king sized swagger?
That's why I'm lying
I ain't fucking with nothing but the lime green
If you smoking 'cess then dont invite me
However I rip this chronic do the right thing
I'm all she cuz ain't no maybe
We met on 21st and fucking Lime Street
Take ya fucking homey, where my girl be?
The only fucking way you can excite me
Is Mary Jane
[Chorus]
[Warren G]
I done sinned, sipped on gin with other women
But kept it respectful like a gentlemen
I spend to hit that ass or go and get the cab
So I can hit the last laugh
Tonight if it's not the bomb, then I'ma be mad
But I'm sure it won't last for long, I got a stash at home
Make love 'tween my Swisher with my half a zone
I can't leave you alone
[Snoop Dogg]
And I know that you know that I be smoking and you about to ooee
So fire it up and get high with me
And let me see if you get as high as me
Now that's what's happening
Cuz I know that you probably don't believe what you hear and you see
A nigga like the D-O-double-G-Z
So put your hands up in the air and repeat after me

MLK 
(feat. Dave Chappelle)
[Snoop Dogg]
You know sometimes in my rhymes I just feel like I has to
Do what? Give ya something to mash to (allright)
Cuz you know I'm the master superb superior
Interior attractions, I'm maxin' relaxin' in penthouse suites
with seven hos at my feet
To dress me, caress me, to lead me, to guide me
Protect me in, perfect be in love, don't stress me
You wanna roll on some jet-skis?
You wanna roll up some green weed?
I got the key to whatever you need
As we proceed we a long way from LBC
BUt that's what you get when you fuck with the P-I-M-P
I came through just to scoop you up, to Snoop you up
And tap that booty up
[Nate Dogg]
Taking a ride on the East Side
Made a right on MLK
What a beautiful day, what a day, what a day
Ridin' high on the East Side
Looking for a hoodrat today
Don't you wanna come out and play
Come and play, come and play
[Warren G]
Nigga please, out on these, I'm a veteran
Who stays on the beach on bicycles pedalin'
Quit meddling in my business I'm a grown man
I leave no witnesses, I'm a known man
I understand reality to the fullest
And plan on duck technicalities with a bullet
I'm full of it, out in public to the max and I like it
These bitches love it I gangsta rap
Perhaps it's an addiction because of the non-fiction
Rhymes that get written, I don't know
So when cats is bullshiting and I'm steppin' it up
And if it get hot in herre? I'm wetting it up
If I can't enter in with my Chucks
I don't need to be going
If you can't make a thousand bucks, you don't need to be ho'ing
I'm showing the real world some 16s
Don't stop, get it girl, you a dick-fiend
[Chorus]
[Snoop Dogg]
Pass the pill, and holler at Phil
And make a move with Shaquille in my new Snoopdeville
Cuz I'm a vet with a cool first step
My game guaranteed to bust any bitch
That I,  want and I need and I have
A lot of y'all wanna come by the pad
And walk on my marble floor
Just to say you blew with the remarkable
[Warren G]
Listen to me baby doll
I'm hated by many, loved by 213
Respected by all, feared by none
Hon' you stuntin' with a hall
Get involved with me, instantly you become bonded
Then eventually you'll get taught to shoot my time
(So you can hold me down) Bonnie
Daddy need you bad
You konw what you could do with a half a key?
Come on, and smash with me
[Chorus]
[BEEP]
[Dave Chappelle as Rick James]
Where's the Bishop?
Bishop, pick up the phone motherfucker
I know you with Snoop
Probably fucking my old pussy
That's right
I drop pussy on the streets and then Bishop Don the Magic Juan
comes and scoops it up, pimps it on the ho strole for me
Then sends it back to Rick James
And I make the bitch get in the booth and sing hits
That's right, bitch
Cuz I'm Rick James

My Dirty Ho 
[Chorus - Nate Dogg]
My dirty ho
Scandalous ho
My dirty ho
Scandalous ho
[Snoop Dogg]
My homie baby mama trying to fuck me
Would I be wrong if I let her suck me?
It ain't me, it's her, dogg, she'll tell you the same
She don't belong to you man, she belong to the game
A lil' nasty scandalous individual
Hittin' you for you chips and all your residuals
See, bitches do the same thing
to athelets and entertainers and hood niggaz
Cuz, we in the same game
I don't know why it's like that
When I was growing up I remember bitches wouldn't fight back
Now these hos push the game and they wanna strike back
I treat a bitch like Tina, that mean I'm like Ike, I guess
Back-back-back to reality you funky hood rat
You good for nothing shit talking bucked mouth
Want some real shit I give a fuck about
How the bitch feel if she get killed?
I don't give a fuck and I don't think I ever will
[Chorus]
[Warren G]
We started off friendly fucking
I thought it wasn't nothing but nothing
Then all of a sudden her nigga started loving the muffin
She got a husband, he be gone a lot
So we be fucking in they home a lot
Shopping his expenses while he on tour
I pedal to the floor on one of his Benz's
Flossing for my friends and shit, spending his Benjamins
Then all of a sudden it came to an end and shit
Once he saw me and his dame pass
Walking in the rain holding hands talking about his lame ass
And how we entertained for my gangbang ass
A man jumped out with his thang ready to blast
Ski mask over his face, I reached to grab a 38
that I grabbed from her husband safe
I blast a couple to his face and made it to her tilt
and she checked her answering machine, her husband got killed damn
[Chorus]
[Nate Dogg]
She thought I was gone
Thought I left on tour today
Far away
Thought I was in another place
When the dog's away
Funny how the cats will play
But-but baby girl
I saw you and him walking in the rain
She thought I was gone
Thought I left on tour today
Far away
Thought I was in another place
When the dog's away
Funny how the cats will play
But-but baby girl
I saw you and him walking in the rain
[Chorus]
Hoooooooooo

Run On Up 
[Chorus - Nate Dogg]
You got beef then go and run on up
We ain't worried about nothing
Half of y'all doing nothing but bluffin
You got beef then go and run on up
We ain't worried about nothing
Half of y'all doing nothing but talking
Ain't it man?
[Warren G]
I'm strictly to street with it, listen to me
They speak it but we did it, they hated on my "Ghetto Village"
But if Stevie can see it, it must mean that I'm real with it
Corporate America gotta deal with it
I'm riding this 'til the finish line
213 still in this 'til they give me mine
Rewind the show and watch the movie
I'm mad as fuck I let this industry use me
[Snoop Dogg]
I'm a low-key OG which is well known
Snoop Alfons Capone Corleone
In the streets with the elite my rap sheet is hella long
Let it go, naw let it 'lone
You wanna battle when the shadows are creapin'
And if you talking about beef then nigga ain't no sleepin'
The hood ain't got no Geneva either
If you run off at the mouth then I'm gonna leave you breathe-less
Breathless, chestless, best list' ya bastard
Looking at my homies like you wanna slide past them and get with me
Need I warn you I'm from Dogg House motherfucking California
Now if you want it like you think you do
We can set up a head up and I bank ya boo
Don't underestimate, a lot of suckers player-hate
they know about the big D-O-double, Warren G and Nate
[Nate Dogg]
Too much talking shit
Let's get down to this list
If you got beef go and run up
I'ma bust him in his lip
I'm gonna shoot through that dude vest
Shut the fuck up and run run up

Sing about how she got her heart broke
You were reaching for stars
I just want me something natural
When you're alone it gets mighty cold
Don't act as if you did not know

And I wanted this to be elaborate and so strenuous
And then you just slide by and wiz-ave
You on another piz-age
Is that the way you gon be-hiz-ave?
I know you're feeling all hurt inside
But won't you talk to a playa?
Let me help out your pride
I'm like a counselor, a pastor, a priest or a physchologist
A shrink... on a freak
Peep (my) my technique
And I wear minks, gator boots
And I'm the rip that gets the loot
And I ain't afraid to shoot
And I love to toot toot
Beep beep as I slide up the street
I'm from the LBC and I don't know what y'all done heard about me
But I'm a C-R-I-P with some P-I-M-P too
I'm a real pimp playa from the 213 crew
Now look here boo

Holla at her Nate Dogg (Holla, holla)
[Chorus:]

When you're alone it gets mighty cold
Don't act as (Check this out) if you did not know
She let me play with her heart

Shotgun with the thing
Coat chillin watchin "The Lion King"
Crying and thangs

Hop back and I'm trying to aim..
At everything, that be hating my fame
Since regulatin, been lacing the game
Ain't no mistake in the game
Two-one mother f'in dwizzle sippin on the sizzle
And that's for shizzle
Four times for da riddles
You know these bars
Everywhere we go...you know who us are
You could tell by the car
Champagne caviar
Bubble bath, I say I love you..
And I laugh
[Chorus:]

Stretch ya out and lay you sideways
Pull ya hair and twist ya body ike I'm supposed to
(Twist something, twist something, twist something)

We hit the club like whatever's clever
Snoop Dogg without a dime piece? Never ever
Gators for the haters step to being devil real big

Then I spin on 'em, watch me twist ya bitch
Slugs twist a bitch, nigga watch you sleep in a ditch
Pow-pow boogie to the big bang-bang
Lil' mama wanna swang with the 213 gang (Number one boss playa)
Hefner like Hugh, now she's evidence
Splash the heffer with goo; got to do it
I break a bitch, make a bitch get something
Go out and twist something, come on
[Chorus]
[Warren G]
Twist ya body, baby, kiss me, by the way, you drive me crazy
Ain't nothing else that I can say
Drunk as fuck, smoking a blunt
Trying to focus on what you working with in the front
Certain to set it off, she twurking it for the boss
So positive I can hit, my niggaz is in the house
Can't stop 'til I'm paid bitch, I just can't quit
But look at this, I'm on the same shit, ain't it bitch?
You niggaz talk a lot of shit
but walk a straight line and don't fuck with the clique
Bitch get out my bidness
You won't witness ass niggaz get it twisted
This the wrong shit to get hit with
[Chorus]
[Nate Dogg (Snoop Dogg)]
Say hey lil' lady from around the way
No bullshit, there's a party today
We came, it's motherfucking 213
The lights might come on, but we don't leave
Say hey lil' lady why you doing your thang?
Slide over here, let me shoot you some game
Go insane, when hear some music that bangs
We'll get the party started while you're shaking that thang
Nobody.... (nobody, nobody)

Ups

 Downs lyrics
[Warren G]
Please don't get it confused
Cuz I rap that I'm like these other dudes
I doubt that VIP don't get to me
I'm where the crowd at
Still the same, hate the fame, loud and all that
Wylin' ain't a thang we can brawl in the back
Hit hard, sock jaw, fall on your back
No bodyguards imagine and all that
Hear from the streets like 'where my doggs at?'
Keep 'em with heat in case they involve gats
9-11 is for certain hurry call back
Don't paid to get dirt done, now what you call that?
So much love on the streets I can take a fall back
My credentials is based on all facts some things you can hate on
We all macks so if your broad get take on
It's like that overwhelmed like conversations she'll be right back
[Chorus - Nate Dogg]
Ups and downs
All my life
I'm just trying to stay rich

Life's so hard for a young ass nigga trying to get his money in the rap game homie
All my life I dreamed of seeing this, leading this
Rap game, G'ing this, we in this doing this
Doing it for the whole wizord
All my homeboys, tiny loccs and the lil baby gizerds
Yes it's true that dreams can come true
If it happened to me, it can happen to you
Watch out, they shootin'
Look good for a nigga now
You know me, I gotta kick a hundred niggaz down
Even niggaz that I ain't supposed to
Let them dirty, gritty killas close too
I do it for the love of it
No nigga, I do it for the fuck of it
EC IC SP and Naj even though I'm living large
Man, life is still hard

No matter how hard the road

Rivermaya 
Am I real? 
Do the words I speak before you 
Make you feel 
That the love I have for you 
Will see no ending? 
Well, if you look into my eyes 
Then you should know 
That you have nothing here to doubt 
Nothing to fear 
And you can lay your questions down 
'Cause if you'll hold me 
We can fade into the night 
And you'll know 
The world could die 
And everything may lie 
Still you shall cry 
'Cause time may pass 
But longer than it'll last 
I'll be by your side 
Take my hand 
And gently close your eyes 
So you could understand 
That there's no greater love tonight 
Than what I've for you 
Well, if you feel the same way for me 
Then let go 
We can journey to a garden no one knows 
Life is short, my darling 
Tell me that you love me 
So we can fade into the night 
And you'll know 
The world could die 
And everything may lie 
But you won't cry 
'Cause time may pass 
And everything won't last 
But I'll be by your side 
Forever by your side 
So you won't cry

Hands Bound 
Going through the motions with the sound turned down 
Trying to stand up with your hands bound 
Running in place wearing blindfolds 
And you're never contemplating what the mind holds 
It tears me appart 
This vengeant heart thrists fir love lived through art 
Both sides of the sword splintered 
I'd walk for miles to taste your smile 
These eyes see through denial 
Turn of a dial static sings 
Blue gray green 
I can feel her eyes on me

Paint peeling portrait

Got to give them everything 
All the more to throw back at you 
There's no way to win 
There's no way out 
It's time again 
The targets on my head 
Shake hands and smile 
Filth under the fingernails 
Lies diguise the queen 
Truth corrupts the king 
Brings the kingdom to it's knees 
You're better when you're nothing 
People feel better next to nothing 
As soon as you got something 
It's time to knock you down

Step Up 
Step up to the forefront 
Lifes a warfront 
Called a fight for soul 
March on with a heart strong 
Let conviction hold it's own 
They try to sink their teeth in 
Drain your soul and clip your wings 
This brings confrontation 
Man your station 
Cut their strings 
Your last chance for redemption slips right through your hands 
Trivialized by vision and the passing of sand 
It's been a long road nowhere and i've seen it all 
I'll just keep on pushing forward unti i fall 
Step up

Why is it falling
All that fills you inside
Never say die  a new day is dawning
Hold your head up high

All that fills you inside
Never say die  a new day is dawning

Conscience black from stealing time
Still we march as we strive till the war is won
And we'll stomp out this plastic oblivion
In search for this cell's key
Let me out
You should know with each stone you throw
The closer I am to be remembered
You should come back out to find my way
Don't lay in back  attack is understood
I've been there where Ive gone wrong

This is not as much fun as it used to be 
Nothing is ever going to me as much to me 
I've drinken from a chalice full of tears from an angel 
Drowning in a pool of desire 
Fear and anger this time not my fault 
I cannot recall ever feeling this lost 
It's painted on my face everything that i stand for 
I look into the mirror into the eyes of a stranger

Withdrawn 
Withdrawn from all pursuits of passion and purpose 
The fear of the unknown 
Increasingly nervous 
One day it rains on your parade 
Like a hand grenade 
Complicates 
Slaps you in the face 
As if you disobeyed misbehaved

Without A Fight 
They want to strip you of one thing 
Bring on the downpour 
Toast the scapegoat 
Magnify the eyesore 
Back once more 
This time to even the score 
See to it they can't ignore this declaration of war 
Taint provokes all purity 
Contaminates the soul 
Pain evokes these memories 
That cannot be controlled 
The jaded face of yesterday readies to attack 
They say this is the price we pay 
I say no turning back 
Look into these eyes 
Don't you realize 
There's a life inside 
That will not die without a fight

Judge Roy 
The train came behind him like a shot from a gun in yer sleep
And just for a second he forgot what to do with his feet
The photo creases dug in to his chest 'til they cut
And sweet Lily Langtry whispered his name through the dust
So it's out with the older one and in with the new
Here comes the judge in somebody else's shoes
Ah here comes the judge in somebody else's shoes
Champagne heels are gonna dig a golden hole in the dirt
So keep your guns in your jackets I'm sending you out with a curse
Keeping the law from the Pecos to the Rio Grande
And sweet Lily Langtry whispered his name through the sand
So it's out with the older one and in with the new
Here comes the judge in somebody else's shoes
Ah here comes the judge in somebody else's shoes
He heard her name call
As the Texas wind blows
From ten thousand miles away
To the cactus that frames her face
So it's out with the older one and in with the new
Here comes the judge in somebody else's shoes
Ah here comes the judge in somebody else's shoes

Crawling Around in this mess we started
Put it all together just to pull it all apart

You're lighter than a feather
But you're sinking like a stone
Both of us together would be better off alone
And nothing should ever have to be this hard

Somewhere In Between 
How do you want to feel now?
Do you move or wonder how?
So many thoughts, so many reasons
Walking right through you like you wanted me to
Do you tell yourself it's all right, let it all go away?
Why do we still pretend there never was an end?
A different face you said you needed
And like an old movie, the stars are you and me
And for the final scene we're fucking caught somewhere in between
I'm not here, or goin there
I've been clean
I'm somewhere in between
I'm not here, or goin there
I've been clean
I'm somewhere in between
And now you've walked for so long
And with each step it keeps getting so wrong, 
So wrong

Tracks Of My Tears 
People say I'm the life of the party 
'cause I tell a joke or two 
Although they might be laughing loud and hearty 
Deep inside I'm blue 
So take a good look at my face 
You'll see my smile looks out of place 
If you look closer, it's easy to trace 
The tracks of my tears... 
I need you, need you 
If you see me with another girl 
Seeming like I'm having fun 
Although she may be cute 
She's just a substitute 
Because you're the permanent one... 
So take a good look at my face 
You'll see my smile looks out of place 
If you look closer, it's easy to trace 
The tracks of my tears... 
I need you, need you 
Outside I'm masquerading 
Inside my hope is fading 
Just a clown oh yeah 
Since you put me down 
My smile is my make up 
I wear since my break up with you...

hit so hard hit so fast 
came from somewhere above me 
an existence stuck behind

the streets are empty 
and I'm walking home 
the city sleeps lost 
souls moves alone 
and I need some words 
to fill up the end 
over and over and over again

scratching through these walls 
some kind of dark feeling 
still stopping from the fall 
an existence to some 
from 4 to 3 to only one

was it enough to sell your soul

I think so 
could they let you

trip on yourself you're on your own

I pretend, I pretend to choke
but there are things we should not joke about.
I made a list - a list of things I tried so hard,
so hard to forget about.

some moved away or even dead.
Everything changes so much.
Nothing ever stays the way it is.
It don't do me much good here,
the earth is changing every year.

Modern Day Prayer 
God, if you can hear, can you help me and my friends?
We've been driving all night into dead ends.
We just wanna find our own way home again.
We knew you as kids but lost you in smokey bars.
We lost you in the boom of lowered cars -
in parties that grew into the yard
God, if you can hear, as the sun is creeping down,
Could you kindly point me right out of town?
Honestly I'm sick and tired of falling down.
We knew you'd be here in the fray of darkest nights,
and the sad and holy glow of tv light,
in the blood and the bruise of back-alley fights.
So we're totally deprived,
buried alive
I couldn't help myself to save my life
Totally deprived

is not worth what I'm getting paid to make

I can't pretend that this is working right.

at least from where I'm seeing things.
Oh, sad oh sad and holy glow,

Romancing The Ghost 
There was no more chemistry, exciting chords or harmonies,
infectious riffs or melodies to sing.
Twas' not a single speck of magic there
in that tangled mess of moving air,
so we shut off all our amps and we called it quits.
And this old house grew quiet as the cars they pulled away,
in this uninspired ending of this uninspiring day.
And it got so awful quiet now except for passing cars
or the hum of drunken discords creeping from the local bars.
Not another song, the music died,
though our ears and fingers tried,
our tired hearts could not provide a tune.
And was it true? Where we really through,
but I just began to sing what I wanted to.
D minor was the final chord and Kevin played it hard,
and it resonated down the hall and out into the yard.
And I remember thinking that we lost something that day
as I rolled up all my chords and put my guitar away.
Not another song, the music died,
though our ears and fingers tried,
our tired hearts could not provide a tune.

Sad Semester 
I feel myself getting sick,

Oh how the desks begin to dig in my back.
A sad semester encroaches.
All the teachers and the coaches weren't tolerant
of individuals who made up their own minds.
I made mine too.
'Cause I'm through.

Hey! What am I doing here?
I have things to do, there's life outside -
and I'm stuck inside this classroom.
The loners become cops
they grow more lonely in their squad cars.
I find it funny how the all-stars
are all old

 fat.
The cheerleaders have babies,
with houses and husbands.

That Sad And Holy Glow 
I saw it in the eyes of the checkout girl -
that sad and holy glow every blue-collar knows,
like the lit windows on my childhood street
where the deep, dark secrets of the family are kept.
Beneath the mire and stench of growing debt,
the deep, dark secrets of the family are kept.
Credit is a whore who won't wake up and leave,
but believe me I'm not sleeping with her anymore.
I don't want to be a slave, I just want to be free

The Sticks Are Woven In The Spokes Again 
Yesterday I broke my favorite chair.
It cracked as I was sitting there,
and on my way to work, I fell asleep.
That girl reminded me
Of another girl I used to see,
and her ghost continued haunting me
all day long.
You won't recognize the sound my engine makes,
the balding tires, the squeaky brakes,
but everybody makes mistakes, I guess.
That girl reminded me
of another girl I used to see,
and her ghost continued haunting me

And I just want to laugh,
but it's just going to hurt.
'Cause I can't fix what I don't know I broke,
just laugh and tell another joke,
the sticks are woven in the spokes again.
I can't fix what I don't know I broke,

the sticks are woven in the spokes again.
I came home to find my neighbors gone,
I found my teenage car parked on the lawn
and thought of all the ways that things have changed.
So, it's true I'd never challenge you,
why do you always challenge me?
I don't get paid to sing what everyone is thinking.
And I just wanna laugh,
but it's just gonna hurt.
'Cause I can't fix what I don't know I broke,

another tear to cry
another kill goodbye i'll go

so just roll all the tears away
strong destroys the weak again

a thousand tears won't wash away the pain

Dico caccialo col braccio libero e se ne andra'
Un giocattolo, e' chiaro che lo merito
ma ho paura di esserlo giocandoci
ho paura che amare sia impossibile

L'Attenzione 
Ai pi? che mostreranno indifferenza
vorrei parlare con questa canzone
lasciando scivolare la mia barca sopra il mare
e la coscienza verso l'attenzione
Lavoro quasi sempre a luce spenta
coi lumi a limitare la visione di questo mondo barbaro
cerco una luna che mi guardi
e che mi parla sopra i tetti
ma non pu? accadere mai,
cerco qualcuno che mi spieghi
anche i pi? semplici concetti
che mi dia un respiro e canta:
Strigneme add? tiene tutto chello ca ce v?
Strigneme add? tiene tutto 'o scuro
Strigneme co sole 'n faccia
'n faccia a ll'omme ca nun so
Strigneme int'a sti braccia
Fino a che non guarir?
Se invece il buio scivolasse dentro
ancora guerre e mai rivoluzioni
come la luce pu? fermare una bellezza da guardare
mentre l'odio vince tutte le ragioni
Ai pi? che hanno mostrato indifferenza
sar? brevissimo nel ricordare
che non pu? esistere una nuova fratellanza
senza dividere la torta da mangiare
non voglio un mondo che nasconda
le miserie della gente
ma che vuol sembrare bello,
cerco una voce che ruggisce
ci? che grido nei miei occhi
e che mi canti solo quello:
Strigneme add? tiene tutto chello ca ce v?
Strigneme add? tiene tutto 'o scuro
Strigneme co sole 'n faccia
'n faccia a ll'omme ca nun so
Strigneme int'a sti braccia
Fino a che non guarir?

Loop 
Secondo me, l'anima
E? qualcosa che va
Piu' lenta del nostro pensiero
Fluttua lentamente
E il gioco della mente
La rende distante dal vero
A parte questo la parola
Rivolge comunque il suo veloce programmare
Ad immagini che da sempre usa ricordare
Secondo me, l'anime
Cammina veloce quanto il ritmo
In un missaggio molto lento
Mi sublima pensare 
Al moto circolare 
Delle onde...
Nel mare trovo la rosa della lingua
Che spinta da una corrente sottostante
Lascia le onde litigare
Cosa che la testa, la mia testa
Si diverte ad imitare
Dalla brina alla schiuma del mare
Mi sublima pensare 
Al moto circolare 
Delle onde...
A parte questo ritorno a pensare
Che per capire bisogna dilatare i riflessi
Renderci partecipi dei processi, complessi dello stato emotivo
Posto sempre sotto pressione
E lo sforzo ad agire diventa una mera ragione
Una scusa nella quale l'istinto si puo' rifugiare
Continuo a pensare 
Al moto circolare 
Delle onde...

Cerco una storia che abbia un lontano finire....
Fuoco ed asfalto si ghiacciano sotto di me
Voglio restare presente nel tempo che vivo
Voglio toccare le cose che il mondo mi da
Cerco una storia che abbia un lontano finire....
Bibita alcolica rotola sotto di me
Vivo quel lato nascosto che e' meglio coprire
Vivo cercando la chiave che il giorno mi da
corro, ritorno di lacrima a partire
Corro cercando nel senso...che senso non c'e'
Cerco una storia che abbia un lontano finire....

Non ho niente da dire su ci? che rappresento
mani da tagliare ? tutto quello che io sento di fare 
amo le cose da sporcare 
ancora litio,culo,faccia
tutta roba per guardarmi e avere niente
io non guardo,non vedo e non sento 
e tutto ci? che rappresento lo invento 
resto assorto e mi sento toccare 
alito distratto qualche cosa da baciare
ma brucia ? tutto quello che so dirmi 
allora stanco disegno le trame
con l'acido di base io volo sulle lame
ancora oggi mi sento pi? vivo 
e tutto quello che c'? di bello lo aspiro
lascio un corpo permanente per 
trovarmi nuovamente nel giro
lascio gli occhi a guardare la gente 
per guardare me stesso mi rivolgo alla mente
....e aggiungo con rima

altri mutui respiri
non ho niente da dire su ci? che rappresento 
bibita biliare senza l'ombra di un accento
favola omicida non ancora definita per la folle dipartita del momento 
lascio tutti a pensare sul fatto che io mento 
feto diagonale in una pancia di cemento
scatola miliare nel percorso cerebrale del momento 
appendo un unico accento sul tempo 
sulla voglia di fare ed in ci? che rappresento

Vivo In Un Furgone 
Vivo in un furgone giu' alla ferrovia
quasi perfetta la carrozzeria
chiarame'-chiarame'-chiaramente non e' casa mia
anche se puo' sembrare l'unica
La mia techno non si giudica
forma di espressione libera
quando corro di notte e lontano penso a un'isola
quante cose mi comunica
Vorrei guidare tutto il tempo fino a rinascere
Ho rifugio in una scatola
piena di benzina e musica
chiarame'-chiarame'-chiaramente e' vera musica
non e' finzione scenica
sono un negro di periferia
Vorrei guidare tutto il tempo fino a rinascere

Black Angels, White Shadows 
Face to Face, i'm not alone the shadows cry my tears
In the dark, forced apart my panic leads to fear
Put yourself in my shoes, would you feel like your in danger?
My enemy is not alone in your fear lives a stranger
Trapt inside, your world of lies your actions bring no rights
Looking far, searching wide my visions out of sight
Stinging hard, fighting rough my drinking leads to fear
Now blessed, im alone

Drown You 
I remember back in the day,
When i was afraid to say what i had to say
Back in the past when i let you live off me
I gave you everything what you could ever need
Unapreciatly you took my gifts for free
And now your back again,
Hoping things can still be free
But now i'm not the pushover that once i used to be
So when you turn up on my door
I won't be home coz i'm looking for somthing more.
I remember you'd said it privately,
Mentioning how much better you are
Just because i'm far away don't mean i can't hear your farce
You know i know, but still you continue do it so
Infront of all my friends you make my life look like a joke
And you Criticzize everything inside my heart
You think been a friend is about you stright from the start
I know you reilise what your doing to me
But this is it, no more tears for you to see
Just let me breath
Just let me see
Just let me surface from the water were you kept me
Just let me Break
Free!
I want to
Break
Free!
I want drown you in the water just like you did to me...
Don't stay, Don't stay Coz your your not welcome anymore,
Just let me breath
Just let me see
Just let me surface from the water were you kept me
Just let me Break
Free!
I want to
Break
Free!
I want drown you in the water just like you did to me...
Breathe.... just let me breathe
Don't want to be here in the water,
The place that scares me.

Midnight Ride 
Jenny got her house on the right side of town
Yeah well she's moved schools she'll have some real friends now
Well on the first day of school everything went great
Jenny 'd made new friends, got asked out on a date
Well jenny she knew what her parents would say
"not a chance in hell your way to young to date"
Well i wont tell them
They'll never no anyway
"Hey I'm sleeping in friends"
Her parents frowned ok..
Jenny felt guilty about telling the lies
But what's a pizza a party a moonlight ride?
Well the pizza was good, And the party was great
But the midnight ride was gonna have to wait
For they didn't know they had to much drink
Then it all went black the car smashed in to bits
She thought her heart was gonna call it quits
She heard "Call an ambulance these kids are in trouble"
Voices she heard a few at her best
But she knew there were two cars involved in this wreck
Then she wondered "Is Jeff alright?"
And if the people in the other car..well if they were alive
She woke in a hospital to faces so sad
"You've been in a wreck and it looks pretty bad"
The voices echoed around her bed
And they gently told her that Jeff was dead
They said "jenny look we have done all we can do"
But it looks as if were gonna lose you too
"What about people in the other car?"
"I'm so sorry Jenny but they have died to"
Jenny prayed forgive me for what I've done 
I only wanted to have one night of fun
"Tell All there family, I've made their lives dim, 
And wish I could return their families to them." 
"Tell Mum and Dad I'm sorry I lied, 
And that it's my fault so many have died.
Oh nurse wont you please tell them that from me?
The nurse just stood there-she never agreed
But she took jenny's hand with tears in her eyes
And a few moments later..jenny had died
A man asked the nurse
"Why didn't you do your best to bid that girl her one last request?"
She looked at the man with eyes so sad
Because the people in the other car were her mum and dad....

Why are we letting the world fade,
Why are we letting it change,
It used to be so fucking equal,
Now it seems there's to many people,
There's people who kill,
Just because there ill,
And there's people who die,
Because there sick off life.
Goodbye blue sky
Goodbye blue sky...goodbye

They just don't belong in this place,
There killing the world, and killing our souls,
They think they can tell us what we should be told,
There's something wrong, and something not right,
There stopping the sun from shining as bright,
We need to stop them i know you agree,
We need to stop them, you and me.

Dragging me down
Look talk and act like you do
Get out my head
Maybe I'd be Better dead!
Brainwashed believers
Turn off your TV's there here for your children
A monsters breeding
Here comes more lies and scheming
Don't become fodder, Put down the remote and look outside
What do you see?

The New Kid 
In my dreams i allways fall right down
But there words hurt more than the ground
Adults don't really seem to care
After the way that i dress they only think it's fair
A strict uniform can be seen
But underneath the clothes that's where i bleed
The fits of rage pump through there vains
Sometimes i wish i'd stayed the same
Just the new kid, Trying to get along
Nobody cares, Nobodys friend
Back of the class, i never stood up
My favorite t-shirt, covered in blood
There fun to them is just like one big game
My guess is that they don't even know my second name
I just get called "the freak"
Am i just alone or is this just a dream?
Kids will be kids that's how it seams
I think there more like a monsters from tv
They tease and laugh, call me lame
Most times i just run off and cry about my pains
Just the new kid, Trying to get along
Nobody cares, Nobodys friend
Back of the class, i never stood up
My favorite t-shirt, covered in blood
Why? Why? WHY! WHY!
My? My? MY! LIFE!
WHY MY LIFE!
WHY MY LIFE!
WHY!
Now the new kid, His life is a mess
He wanted no trouble, But they could care less
The new kid, No plans had been foiled
For now the new kid, Is buried in soil

Until i,
Pick up the pieces

Was thrown away
Have you no more to say

Idle hands
And these scars wont show
People never will know
Or see your face beneath
That mask that you show
Tomorrow ends today
No more hurting           
No more 
Cant hear your screaming
Your screams
Are none existent

You have no heartbeat
No beat
Your like a stillborn

Tomorrow ends today
So long fair well
I'll fuck'in Veda sane goodnight

From under this rock
Into the light
Were you cannot fight
And people can see through your lies
No supprise
And these scars will show
People now will know
They can see beneath
That mask that you show
Tomorrow ends today
No more hurting
No more 
Cant hear your screaming
Your screams
Are none existent

Animal

I'm the only one who's always left to blame
Take what you can take
Hurt is your only idea of a game
To break away
I don't have that within me
And I'm not your prey
So I bite the hand that feeds me
When all you do is break me
And put me
You put me in a cage
When I look in the mirror
All that I see
A zoo animal that wants to be free
Just get away, get away from me
'Cause I'll never be who you want me to be
No
It's always the same
It's not easy to keep myself contained
Sit back and relax
How can I when I'm going down in flames?
'Cause all you do is break me
And put me
You put me in a cage

Get away get away get away get away

Feel the warmth
Take me in your arms
Can you keep this heat
Oh please don't make me wait
Let me touch your lips
Your body is so sweet
Feel my fingertips
Why is your skin so wet

Hot pleasure ways
Desire burns me up

Hot pleasure ways

There is no shuffle
There is no shuffle here
Here on the north pole
On this quiet dome
Sun shining on crystal
And milky walls of ice
All seem so fragile
Under the polar sky
Cold in the head
But warm in the heart
You could find pleasure
You could find displeasure
There is no sound here
But the rumbling waves
Of the polar sea
I know this anger burning inside of you
And I'm afraid I can feel it too
I know this anger burning inside of you
There is an ice-floe between you and me
This is the place
This is the only place

Quite Unusual 
The sun went down and the ground started sort of grinding
A blinding light tore across the sky
A cyclone swept the landscape out and left it completely flattened out
And several twirls of smoke unfolded like gigantic flowers
The way the morning broke was quite unusual x4
I should have wakened up at once
but this was no concern of mine
so I kept on dreaming
My eyes roamed over the burning ruins
In less time than it takes to tell x3
And I felt like
And I felt like being numbed,              x2

From underneath the cowl

I'm the trusting friend you need
You're the open book I read

I see you sail night and day
On a sea where the waves
Always force you back
It won't take me more than one strike
To release your soul from the cares of life
I'm your guide through the night
Through the night to the light
I see you sink deeper down
In an ocean of pain
Always force them down
You shouldn't be afraid

Always force you down
A voice pierces your ears
My words enter your brain

Tragedy (For You) 
With that skill that was hers alone
She drove her clutches into me
I was dumbfounded
She was hungry
She required me entirely
All that's left is here to remain
It's a dull and cruel pain
That passes the ages unaltered
Her stamp is in my heart
I still feel disemboweled
I clearly retain
A blank
The void
The sore in my soul
The mark in my heart
Her acid reign
Hot sun, global fun
Needed action, start to run
And that voice that was hers alone
Still resounds in me
She left me dislocated
Disavowed
And twitching
Her rhythm is in my heart
She inspired in me
An acute sense of treachery

April 
The truth came around today
Sprung upon us all that's seldom seen
Sheltered until April
We knew they were there
But half pretended, half believed that they
Would disappear come April
They would disappear in April
Lay and watch the clouds
Watch the clouds rolls by
To forget is not....
Roll into the sky
Lay and watch the clouds
Roll by, roll by
It's the snow, it's the wind, it's the rain
It's the sun...
The thaw bares everything
Like a sun that, like a sun that swims
Nakedly through April
I hope we can hold this shell
It's paper thin, it's pale, it's blue
For you, for you
And for me
Blue for you
And for me
We happily pretended
Lay and watch the sun
Watch the sun roll by
To forget is not...
Roll into the sky
Lay and watch the sky

Cavalla 
Didn't you learn
It's supposed to burn
Didn't you know
Well I'm telling you so
Time is traced
When I look at your face
And it's no surprise
He doesn't have your eyes
Yes, it's no surprise
They shine green, so green
Yes, it's no surprise
They shine green, so green
They shine green, so green
And the spurs you've got
Well, they matter not
When the laws fate
Pull all the weight
Fate pulls all the weight
If you would only take a look inside his eyes
You'd known they'd seen the same as you
It's supposed to burn
It's supposed to burn
It's supposed to burn

Devil's Play 
The Queen Bee
Holds her wings to me
Among the paper roses
Nothing seems so long ago
And yes, you still look pretty
Home is where your roses grow
She said ???It's a lucky thing you know???
Three fists of sand
Thrown to the sea
And three coins in the fountain
To and fro this turnpike goes
Let's turn these wheels to wings
Wash away the devil's play
Three for you and three for me
Wash away the devil's play
Three for you and three for me
To the sea
Home is where your roses grow
She said ???It's a lucky thing you know???
We're going home

Every Day 
Absence makes the heart grow wild
As I pretend to sit here and smile
I want someone that I can hold
Someone here when there's nowhere to go
I want someone I can see every day
Someone I can see every day
Someone here as my heart lies awake
I want someone I can see every day
To say my lips are sugar sweet
Touch me from my face to my feet
Make the rest of the world go away
I want someone I can see every day
I want someone I can see every day
Someone I can see every day
Someone here as my heart lies awake
I want someone I can see every day
Nowhere to go and nowhere to stay
I feel so far away
I'm not sure how much more I can take
I feel so far away
I want someone I can see every day
Someone I can see every day
Someone here as my heart lies awake
I want someone I can see every day
Make the rest of the world go away
I'm not sure how much more I can take
Someone here as my heart lies awake
I want someone I can see every day

For An Exchange 
Hurry, hurry hey I'm ready
Come on let's go
Let's go far away from here
Come on, come on let's find
Another side of the world
Where everything's a souvenir
Should my mind escape me now
Don't put up a sign
Let it be, oh let it be
Heed those words of wisdom
And you'll probably find
It's in a better place than me
Should my mind escape me (in a place)
Go on let it be (far away)
Should my mind escape me
It was wanting to be free
Should my mind escape me
Heed those words of wisdom
And you'll probably find
It's in a better place than me
Should my mind escape me (In a place)
Go on let it be (Far away)
Should my mind escape me

Should my mind escape me (In a place)
Go on let it be (Far away)
Should my mind escape me

Should my mind escape me (It's all foreign)
Won't you come along with me (It's all for an exchange)
Should our minds escape us
How easily we could be free

Sky Walker 
Walking on a sun burnt sky
It isn't day it isn't night
Seems I'm the only one awake
I look for love to come my way
It isn't night it isn't day
Shuffle off to Buffalo
See the downtown go, go, go
???Round and ???round the oldest tree
I count the rings I'll never see
They keep on keep on saying
This haze is gonna burn
I keep on keep believing
Something's gonna turn
Walking on the sun burnt sky
It isn't day it's not quite night
Lazy Susan window pane

They keep on keep on saying
This haze is gonna burn
I keep on keep believing
Something's gonna turn

Trouble Heart 
Happy days are here again
I half believe and half pretend
Just one thing that's always on the mend
Please take this trouble heart away

Trade it to an auctioneer
He can make it disappear
Try anything ???long as it's far from here
Please take this trouble heart away
I don't think that I can wear it another day
You know as hard as I try
This old heart comes right back to me
Just like the track of a bird in the sky
Something I could not see
Now I always thought it'd be better
All shiny and new
Well it might be all busted and broken
But at least it's true
Don't take this trouble heart away.

Warm Hands, Cold Heart 
These hands are warm
If you want to come along
They'll lead you far
Enough to lead you on
The less you say
The more you give away
I think I know

Cold hearted
Beware my friend
The circle never ends
Leave it astray
Comes back to you some day
Warm hands, cold heart
Together tear apart
I think you know
What you started
Cold hearted
Would it kill you to melt some away
And love something for more than a day
Don't make wishes and don't ever pray
I hear everything that you don't say
These hands are warm
If you want to come along
They'll take you far
Enough to take you on
Warm hands, cold heart
Together pull apart

Libero 
Sento l'estate che mi pulsa in cuore 
Voglio partire, voglio viaggiare 
Voglio un posto in spiaggia sotto l'ombrellone 
Prendo il primo volo a disposizione 
E allora parto 
Lascio tutti qua in citt? 
Vado lontano vado all'equatore 
E scendo in pista, e comincio a ballar 
Sar? un bel viaggio me lo sento nel cuore 
Vento da sud, vento da lontano prendimi per mano portami lontano 
Vento da sud, se passi a Milano prendimi per mano perch? ho voglia di sentirmi 
Rit 
Libero di fare tutto quello che mi pare 
Sono stufo della gente che mi dice cosa fare 
Girovagando su una spiaggia infinita 
Girovagando alla ricerca della cica 
Girovagando un sogno spensierato 
Fare fare festa e fare casino 
E bere bere bere bere fino al mattino 
Per poi svegliarmi con la testa pesante 
Lo rifarifarei rifarei mille volte 
Vento da sud, vento da lontano prendimi per mano portami lontano 
Vento da sud, se passi a Milano prendimi per mano perch? ho voglia di sentirmi

Pigiama 
Sole che lascia la rossa scia per il sorgere della luna 
La citt? sul mar scende in festa all'imbrunire 
Giochi di sguardi che ti fanno vacillare 
Balli proibiti con i ritmi tropicali 
Cala poi la notte ma non ho paura, 
anzi l'atmosfera si raffresca alla sera 
Tante le parole, con il fruscio del mare 
Sulle tue guance un timido rossore 
Scatta la scintilla che accende le parti 
Forte l'emozione di averti qui davanti 
E con i racconti un po' montati del passato 
Un luccichio, il faro ha scintillato 
Si spengono le luci e piano piano i rumori 
Partono le macchine e si chiudono i locali 
E rimaniamo noi due qui da soli 
Un battito soltanto sommato dei due cuori 
Soffice carezza mi concedi dopo un'ora 
? il primo passo verso la bufera 
Soffice carezza morbida mi concedi dopo un'ora 
? il primo passo verso la bufera 
L? dietro Omega c'? la stella polare, 
nei tuoi occhi il mio sogno si muove 
sono il capo della trib?, con un pigiama di rosso e blu 
l'arcobaleno splende su di noi, tu la regina sei negli occhi miei 
sono il capo della trib?, con un pigiama di rosso e blu 
l'arcobaleno splende su di noi, tu la regina sei negli occhi miei 
ecco dopo le carezze, finalmente arrivano i baci 
son felice son contento con te accanto 
lunghi momenti, trepidante attesa d'imbarazzi 
istanti, in cui la voce trema e dopo un gesto 
d'istinto la mano che mi scivola a lato, sul fianco tra le dita 
apro gli occhi ed ? gi? mattino 
rumore di barche che pescano a largo 
apro gli occhi ed ? gi? mattino 
mi alzo, mi volto, dall'alto ti guardo 
e dopo un viaggio con 4 fortune 
? cos? che il mio sogno si muove 
sono il capo della trib?, con un pigiama di rosso e blu 
l'arcobaleno splende su di noi, tu la regina sei negli occhi miei

Sole 
Se potessi avere poteri straordinari 
Farei che i miei sogni potessero realizzarsi 
Che sulle mie spalle spuntassero due ali 
E che dolcemente cominciassero a cullarmi 
Sempre pi? in alto mi farei trasportare 
Fino a raggiungere lo strato di cotone 
E sul morbido atterrerei sicuro 
Sicuro di essere felice come un sole 
E sono qua, guardo il mare, mi viene voglia di viaggiare 
E sono qua, guardo il sole, sento il suo calore 
Sento un brivido che mi scorre dentro 
Sento la vita cantarmi di fianco 
Salto su un piede mi metto a danzare 
Vedo un sorriso sono di faccia al sole 
Le nuvole, che vedo scorrere sotto di me 
Sembran prender forma, mi sembran salutare 
Sarei felice tutto il giorno 
A non fare un cazzo e giocare a scacchi con gli dei 
E sono qua, guardo il mare, mi viene voglia di viaggiare 
E sono qua, guardo il sole, sento il suo calore 
Sento un brivido che mi scorre dentro 
Sento la vita cantarmi di fianco 
Salto su un piede mi metto a danzare 
Vedo un sorriso sono di faccia al sole

E amore tra le barricate
E ci sei tu vicino a me...

Canto Di Un Sufi Metropolitano 
Sono un uomo del deserto
che attraversa il vuoto
sopra un animale cieco
fino alla fine della sua condanna
Sono un naufrago della citt?
in cerca del suo regno
perduto ai dadi con il destino
via dallo spazio e dal tempo
Mi fermo per le strade
disegno un cerchio in terra
per dansargli intorno
costruire un altro universo
dove il percorso sia pi? chiaro
dove si illumina il cammino
ritorno per le strade
e il cielo ad ogni passo
e pi? vicino
Mi rifugio nel Signore dell'alba nascente
contro il male che ha creato
e contro l'oscurit? chi si estende
e contro il male che si soffia sui nodi
e contro il male dell'invidioso quando invidia
Mi rifugio nel Signore degli uomini
Dio degli uomini
Re degli uomini
contro il male del sussurratore furtivo
che soffia il male nei cuori degli uomini
che venga dai demoni o dagli uomini

Cara amica,

io non posso spiegarti meglio,

che ? quando dormo,
che son pi? sveglio,
e che trovo solo in sogno,
ci? di cui ho veramente bisogno,
cara amica di una vita,
io non posso spiegarti meglio no,

che ? quando dormo,
che son pi? sveglio,
Cara amica,
volevo dirti,
proprio adesso,
che vuoi assopirti,
che la notte,
veglia qualcosa,
che il giorno dopo poi
si riposa,
e che mentre sto qui nel letto,
succedon cose che non t'ho mai detto,
certe volte amica mia,
dalle lenzuola io vado via e
ci? che lascio steso qui al mio fianco,
? solo ci? di cui son pi? stanco,
Certe volte,
me ne devo andare,
e via con me,
tu non puoi venire,
perch? la strada,
che devi fare,
da nessun altro,
la puoi imparare,
posso dirti solamente,
ci? in cui credo pi? fermamente,
che c'? un sentiero fatto di brina,
che poi sparisce appena viene mattina,
e che alla fine dei nostri giorni,
da casa vieni ed a casa ritorni,
Andiamo a casa dai..
Andiamo a casa dai..
Andiamo a casa..
Andiamo a casa..

Il Poeta 
Lui parlava di rivoluzione
con le parole pi? belle
noi eravamo stupiti
nel sentirlo cantare
con le parole pi? belle
con le parole migliori
i sentimenti
che tutti noi sentivamo
Lui parlava di verdi colline
e di labbra melograno
e parlava di guerra
come di fare l'amore
quasi fosse lo stesso
come fosse migliore
e ci diceva
di ammazzare i tiranni
E io proprio non ci credevo
quando lo vidi in teatro
agitare quell'arma
gridare alla platea
"E' dovere degli uomini liberi
uccidere i tiranni"
Tu non ci crederai
ma lo fece davvero
e sorrideva davvero
quando venne schiacciato
dalle guardie del corpo
da qui cani da guardia
sotto il calcio dei mitra
sotto i loro scarponi
per vendicare
il loro vecchio padrone
E gli spezzarono tutte le dita
perch? non scrivesse canzoni
e gli spezzarono i denti
perch? non potesse cantare
ma restavano gli occhi
e li potevamo vedere
lui li guardava
e li lasciava stupiti
Quando arriv? il capitano
si svuot? la platea
ed io solo rimasi
a fissarlo atterrito
lui freddamente
gli spar? nella nuca
e per strada gridarono tutti
"Hanno ammazzato il poeta!"
"Hanno ammazzato
hanno ammazzato il poeta"

La Giostra Del Cuor 
Una donna in carriera

da sola al bostr?
E la portano in giro
gli piace averla vicino
la tenga stretta sul cuor
E il giorno sembra sicura
per? la notte ha paura
di svegliarsi al mattino
senza avere un perch?
O svegliarsi da sola
col vuoto tra le lenzuola
o svegliarsi ormai vecchia
per un'ora d'amore
Gira gira la giostra del cuor
finch? viene la sera
nella notte si sveglia l'amor
finch? viene mattina
E ora ? qui e ora ? l?
come scesa dal cielo
e la musica ? solo per lei
e saluta e sorride
e ci crede davvero
che sia un film scritto
apposta per lei

Guarda come ? biondo il mio grano

non pensano neanche a tagliarlo
di asfalto lo stanno coprendo.
Perch? ma perch? non capite
che io non posso laciar la mia terra
ogni albero conosce il mio tocco
ogni frutto ? per me come un figlio.
Le travi di questa mia casa
che io solo da me ho costruita
conoscono tutto di me
in ognuna lascio un pezzo di vita.

Portate via quel mostro di ferro
che mi sta sbranando le mura
vi prego lasciatemi entrare
lasciate che io muoia con lei.
Fermo ma cosa vuoi fare
Masha sei un vecchio testone

e tu solo un vecchio forcone:
Ma ? bello morire di giugno
coi campi incendiati di grano
e l'ultimo giorno che muore
lasciate che io muoia con lui.

Nella Tua Stanza 
Nella tua stanza
colore di rugiada
la vita canta
la notte ? gi? passata
i raggi di sole
appaiono ad oriente
la pioggia cade
bagnandoci la mente
nella mia stanza
il sole nn arriva
nessuno canta
la morte ci avvicina
nell'aria manca
ogni genere di odori
nella mia stanza
ti tolgono i sapori
nella tua stanza
grandi finsestre aperte
le serrature
non chiudono le porte
sulle pareti
uccelli e arcobaleni
nella tua stanza
quello che sogni ottieni
nella mia stanza
camicie senza braccia
dei tuoi pensieri
cancellano ogni traccia
ogni parola
rimbalza sopra i muri
anche i tuoi passi
non sono pi? sicuri
nella tua stanza
si gioca con l'amore
tutto rinasce
se il giorno prima muore
com'era bello
sentire le tue mani
sulla tua pelle
correvano i miei sogni
nella mia stanza
comandano i guardiani
quando ci parlano
ci trattano come cani
non vedo un fiore
da non so quanto tempo
una parola
gentile non la sento
spero soltanto
che quella bella stanza
per la tua gioia
duri ancora abbastanza
per poter dire
che per quanto hanno trovato
chi era il tuo uomo
non l'hanno mai piegato
nella tua stanza

Brucia jacques de molay sull'isola dei giudei
E bruciano i suoi compagni
Per sempre accanto a lui
Sul trono di mammona la tiara e la corona
Bruciano sui bracieri i santi cavalieri
Perche' la sola croce che accettiamo di portare
E' questa nostra spada infissa sullaltare
Jacques de molay adesso come ieri
Non tremano sui bracieri i tuoi santi cavalieri
E dopo tanti anni la storia e' sempre uguale
Le loro voci cantano cullate dal maestrale
E scruto l'orizzonte ogni giorno per vedere
Gonfiarsi dei mantelli con le loro insegne nere
Perche' la sola croce che accetiamo di portare
E' questa nostra spada infissa sullaltare

Sulle colonne antiche e gli eroi fascisti gettarsi
Sulle baionette nemiche e la tua romana
Ci guarda con amore e riconosce il sangue di roma

Vorrei potessi sentire nel tuo cuore
Quello che provo io quando carezzo quesyi pilastri
Che sono le ossa di un dio
Che mi ricorda ogni giorno che nulla e' tramontato
E che il futuro e' solo il ricordo

Sono tempi bui fratelli vengono a portarci via
Con un ordine firmato dalla nuova polizia
Ma se possono arrestarci non potranno mai fermarci
Finche' il cuore battera il mio canto di udira
Per il sangue e per la terra per la nostra liberta'
 per la patria
Ma se possono arrestarci non potranno mai fermarci
Finche' il cuore battera il mio canto di udira
Per il sangue e per la terra per la nostra liberta'
 per la patria
 per la patria
 per la patria

The Storm 
Il nemico s'appresta...
Nel cielo spira un'aria mefitica e funesta
Tutti bravi a parlare ma vediamo ora chi resta
Senti le urla in fondo alla foresta
E' un vento strano un soffio di maestrale
Che ti tramette un brivido speciale
Quando senti nel bosco come canta la civetta
Ma poi il silenzio si taglia con l'accetta
Attento ragazzo che qui si mette male
Senti anche tu la tensione come sale
Non hai mai provato mai nulla d'uguale
Ad un'ebbrezza come questa
Prima di sera qualcuno fara' festa 
Chissa' se saran loro ad avere la mia testa
Enti le urla in fondo alla foresta
L'ora sappresta bambina giu la testa
Si e' alzato il vento e un vento di tempesta
But i am ready for the storm
Yes already i am ready
For the storm ready for the storm
E ora li vedo farsi strada in mezzo ai rami
Le loro armi come fiori nelle mani verso di noi come in 
Un'offerta di una morte dolce e certa
E finalmente termina l'attesa
Ed il bosco con il sole sembra una chiesa
La luce si riflette, ma non abbaglia
E' fredda come gli occhi di chi e pronto alla battaglia
Ma mille passi rimbombano per terra
Suoni ritmati dai canti della guerra
Ogni animale ha smesso di cantare
E' il nostro grido che il cielo fa tremare
E tutto il mondo mi sta correndo incontro
O forse sono io che mi lancio nello scontro
Non sono che una goccia in mezzo  ad un torrente
Che scorre nelle vene di tutta la mia gente
E' lora sappresta bambina giu la testa
Si e' alzato il vento e un vento di tempesta
But i am ready for the storm
Yes already i am ready
For the storm ready for the storm

Vorrei 
Vorrei fossi diversa
ma sei come le altre
vorrei che fosse amore,
ma solo un gioco a carte.
Vorrei che tu vincessi,
ma questo mazzo ? un trucco
vorrei dirtelo un p? meglio
ma proprio questo ? il succo.
Vorrei che questo giorno
non fosse mai venuto
vorrei dimenticarla
in quest' ultimo minuto.
Vorrei che questo sangue non fosse cosi rosso,
vorrei restarti accanto, ma proprio pi? non posso.
Vorrei tirarle contro
questa troia di rasoio,
vorrei vivere in eterno ma guarda come muoio.
Vorrei non dirti addio
vorrei che mi salvassi,
ma in quest'ultima mia marcia
non torno sui miei passi.

27th Hour
Counter Clockwise 
It's too early to be drinking anything at all.  
Give it up and pack it in.  
Don't get up until the morning.  
I don't need you to be here for me. 
Unappreciated broken dreams.  
Seems so unreal.  
You weren't there when you were here.  
So I'm waiting for you to leave.  
So we can regain our self esteem.  
Sad songs and mixed up words.  
Makes you feel more then they should.  
Can't relate to anything  
Anyone else is going through.  
Sometimes with you.  
Your blue eyes and counter clockwise mind, don't please the majority.  
Still you aren't the minority. 
People envy and copy you everyday.  
It'll never go away.  
Pretend to be broken and the rest will follow.  
Why is everyone always so shallow.  
I want to be alone with you, 
But you're always with someone else.    
Another wasted night watching the clock on my shelf.

27th Hour
Effortlessly. 
I swallowed those words that you spat out at me. 
And I thought nothing good could come of this. 
Stay five steps ahead and leave me ten back. 
I don't need the distance but the time it wastes needs to be lost.  
I can watch you from down the street hearing the words you whisper in the light.  
Standing our ground and clutching our hearts.  
I just want to see you from any angle.  
The ones that my camera seem to capture so brilliantly are never real.  
They sit in black frames hung on my wall.  
Smiling at me.  
So effortlessly.

I Fucked This One Up Long Ago. 
Every look.  
Steals mine.  
Stole my love.  
Love your smile, that melted my heart.   
Your heart is mine.  
Mine is everyone else's.   
Everyone such as, 
The ones who hurt, 
The ones who break, who fall.   
Falling hard for you.  
Cute boys with evil ways.  
Toxic lips and sweet words.   
Grasp my heart with every breath oh so hard.  
The air is making this hot.  
But it's colder than ice.  
I'm melting from your touch.   
The bright lights or just your bright smile.  
Stay with me here for awhile.  
Oh how I love this game, 
I'll play with your heart 
and you can play with mine.

Just To See You Smile 
Raincoats break the fall of distilled tears.  
Slowly falling and running to the ground.  
There goes all of my fears,  
As long as you're around.  
I'm pushing people into the traffic now.   
Just so I can see you in the distance.  
They're blocking my view.  
Changing my perspective now.   
Emptying my pockets.  
Emptying my heart into you 
I'm pouring myself into you.  
Just so I can see you smile.

Early Mornings 
Early mornings make me angry
And routine takes away the very essence of the day
But when reflection shows a need for the latter then it matters
So I don't waste away
I used to wakeup at eleven and I 
Never did shit I'm thinking as I pen it that I 
Could have used my time a little wiser 
But it's too late I should have fucken opened my eyes up
Don't you waste today
You say you think that nothing matters
Well put your head back in your arse you fucking waste of skin
The fact you're here's a bonus
I think you'll find the onus 
Is on you to learn 
That he who tries is he who wins
I don't want to waste my time away

Eats Away 
I can't stand 
The taste of defeat
Just like any man
But I know I'll lose more sleep
If I waste another chance
For nothing more than the fear of the unknown
Don't wait
People may have broken down your trust in yourself
So you take that bitter pill and it hurts when you swallow down on it
And it sits inside of you and it slowly eats away
Take that step
So don't wait
'Cause you know you can't afford to
Take a step
Without your fear of failure
Let the rest
Just drop into place 
You'll never know until you place some trust in yourself
Years will pass
But nothing may ever change
If you don't want that for a life and do something today
All those dreams that you have
Not that far out of reach 
You can't live a life 
A life of what ifs
The chances you had
The time that you waste
Realise now that they may never come again
The rest of your life has just begun 
So step to the plate 
What's done is done

Friends 
why do we bother sometimes 
why not give this shit up 
we're meant to be friends but we 
can't let our guard down for too long 
we value our friendship so highly 
but too easily forgotten 
when we want what we want 
we were so tight when we were seventeen 
what fucking happend that's what I want to know 
I think we've lost touch with 
what our friendships really all about 
or maybe things have changed 
people do that's cool we can work it out 
now we are older and stronger 
and more our own men 
just a little confused cause we don't understand 
why we can't hangout forever like the old days 
our friendship was real it couldn't 
have been just a phase the conflict we feel 
in fact is just confussion cause it feels 
like you went and changed it 
wasn't me it wasn't you it's all and illusion 
happens to us all its just not that strange

 The Devil lyrics
Don't kid yourself
'Cause there's a good chance
Your life means nothing
You've got enough to confuse the facts
In time they'll know you're bluffing
You'll catch one out 
But in the meantime thousands more are breeding
It's always you and me who pay 
That's why my heart is bleeding
They are nameless
They are faceless
They are dollar signs
Hostile mergers
Taking over
Killing people from the inside
Drink it down
Throw your package to the ground
I am the devil
I spread myself pretty thin
I'm getting busy with the gluttony and sin
The world is lookin' fresh
I did this emptiness
The world is a girl I'm raping
The real TV's taping the whole thing 
And you were doing nothing but watch me
I am the people you trust 
You're never gonna stop me
Buy your coke or pepsi it doesn't matter
Either way my crew's pockets are getting fatter
What's my name?

I hope there's a heaven and the light's good
I hope you can see us all from there
I don't have faith to just fall back on
Got photos, memories and an empty space
Nothing will feel the same now you've gone
I cannot dignify this let alone justify it
You had got it so together
You found your perfect subject
Completed composition

That's you
so don't test this style cause I'm set to snap
don't pack a gun so I don't do ganster rap 
I kick it over this riff, I roll a spliff
I lova my son and I'm diggin my family
Everybody rip it up hands up in the sky,
Here we go throw it high to the J-I-M-M-Y
Jimmy's rockin hard on too, because of you
you know the part would suck if it wasn't for the crew, so 
[chorus]

cause I hit that shit when I get home 
hilly and beer stickin out my foam dome
so give me that, give me that, give me that cut

putting me to the test I'm not alone 
it's still all up to me 
I'll rise above and I'll look down 
it all seems so miniscule 
I'll riducule the problems that 
towered over me 
all I want to know is how to love myself 
I've had money keep your material wealth 
seems like security 
just you wait and see 
sometimes I bomb I want to give it up

Say what?
Never do we stress 'cause we're known to rock shit
Decks are in effect and we're going to cock this
Twelve gauge, super-fly never had a plan - shit
It's what we do best it's how we scam shit
We're the two eight D crew and we get into
The zone and never leave until we're through 
It's just a test if the rest of the mess
Can flip a song to bang along to nevertheless
We're gonna take what they don't deserve
They're gonna hate the fact that we're rocking
And we make another record, if we're not number one
We're gonna take what they don't deserve
They're gonna hate the fact that we're rocking
And we're motivated by something they could never hope to understand
Jedi Master is the man
Say What?
It's like a TV show, here we go
Kicking around the sound that's sounding def
'Cause I'm sick like salo
I tell ya that we're killing all the fake bullshit 
While they're making hits 
Like I'm taking shits and I'm sick of it
It's clear to me that they don't give a shit what the kids think
'Cause I can't tell the difference between heroin and *NSYNC
As long as they get sponsorship from the biggest cola drink
Open up your eyes to the crooked and you don't blink 
And I'm motivated by something I don't understand
I'm the man guided by the hand of the force
And Jedi Master's on the same plan
Making no sense like the rain man
Underground battles like Vietnam

Hit it twice, pass it left then you kick back track list

So much potential
So much left to achieve
Thanks so much for warm receptions and your clear perceptions
Thanks so much for stealing chairs

I had a dream last night
And I think you know 'cause you were there
And there's not much I can say
That we miss you every day
And I'm bitter 'cause it's unfair
We'll be drinking in the sun
Playing music having fun
'Cause one day I'll see you there
Out of everyone you were the last I expected to grieve for
It seems my place is to be the bereaved
To find the light in darkened places
To see the gift that you were there

Because you stole the farmboy's time 
Cuz if you find me on the trippy hip hop

There's a noise at the front door 
And just last week you sounded just like Faith No More 
Suckers come and go 
There's some things you'll never know 
You've bought a new record kid 
Now you've got a new style 
Let me tell you right now 
You're like a senile pedophile 
Cuz you wanna rape the kids but they wont' pay you shit 
Because you cut your hair when it was time to leave 
OH fingertip main trip, think you're so down and I just can't take it 
Suckers like you who fake it through, you're through

Come and rock the party full swing 
Listen to the styles that I bring and you know that kid

Got to people, feel they tried to sound like you

True Story 
And the story stays the same
The only difference is the name
He's a nice guy and she is a bad girl
He thinks that she can do no wrong
Although secretly 
She longs for every penis in the world
The only one who doesn't know
And while he's bringing in the dough
She is so busy screwing the days away
Although she doesn't deserve it
He seems to think that she's worth it
I can't help thinking of denial
I swear I see it when she smiles at guys
He gets a little crazy
I don't know how he puts up with 
All of her freaky cheating shit
I could not stand my girl to play me
Monday through to Saturday
And she fucks around on him 
While he's working

Nothing is brand new
Kid Jimmy you know you hear me spittin' lyrics over loops
Close friends used to call me Supes
Mad respect to CI crew 
Still rippin' over PFK
So what you gonna do?
Nothing, puffing out my fucking chest 
Crims rock the best
Shout out to Mesk for putting run-ups to the test
Dressed for success but we look like some bums
So easy fucking go, not easy fucking come
Tunnel vision won't enhance your view
So think it through
Do it for your self
Everything you read might not be true
So think it through
Do if for yourself
We rock London, Amsterdam, Carrum Downs and Osaka
You don't have to dig my style 
So step back fuck ya
And you're getting jealous man
Claiming that it's luck 
Ya can't handle it
I don't give a shit you can suck my dick
Say you can smoke me, you probably could
Going down south with your mouth wrapped around my wood
I got you wrapped around my wood
Whoa slow down
I got the low down
On this bigger than Ben Hur sound
That we just lit
So I hit it with a lip
That spits real, in harmony with hits
I can't help it when you shit your pants
I saw you fucking dance
Up and down when the record went number one
Fuming 'cause they're paying for my skills
While we're having fun
Now you're sober
Not drunk from thinking that's it over
Time to face the facts wak - it's only just begun
London, Amsterdam, Carrum Downs and Osaka
You don't have to dig it
Fuck ya

but you won't see it because you think
you're missing out on your youth
turn around one day and see it wasted

well I might be wrong but looking

fear and jealousy in your face its so clear

it's not a waste of time 
don't replace it
nothing

Crown 
Feelings of first degree 
Are all I ever feel, lately
Signs are pointing to you
Whatever the consequence
I'll take that risk, that leap of faith
Just to glimmer in your eyes
I wish I could let me be this
But not when you want that
When you want me to lead you on
This burning fire, my desire
Could lead me to the land of no return
And make you turn around
Around
Beneath the crown I wear
Inside my head is where I'm tearing up
Everything that matters to me 
Why
Do I fear I know how you perceive? 
If you've got something up your sleeve
Let me know, let me know
Is there a way out of this forest?
A path worth taking?
A way to have you?
Well I'd think twice 
If I thought it would serve me well
But my second thought
It won't make me whole
Make me whole
Whole
Beneath the crown I wear
Inside my head is where I'm tearing up
Everything that matters to me 
Why
Do I fear I know how you perceive? 
If you've got something up your sleeve
Let me know, let me know
Don't hold your breath
How could I decide?
What made me lose my mind?
Made me lose my mind
Lose my mind
Beneath the crown I wear inside
(Beneath the crown I wear, beneath the crown I bear)
Inside
(Beneath the crown I wear, beneath the crown I bear)

Return To You 
Where can I find today
Now that you're driving away
I never lied, but somehow I died to you
But something remains, and...
That I will find.
I will leave this world for a little while,
And I will cast myself onto the ocean floor,
And I will ride the sun into the grasp of night,
When I return I'll be the one that you knew before.
When did our moment become
Just another place in time?
I know it was more
Than I gave it credit for
I wanna get that moment back
I wanna pay for my crime.
I'll chase the past into eternity
There's nothing that I won't do
I'll drown away all my sorrows
Find love and give it back to you.
Consider this moment forever
When I'm looking into your eyes again
You'll know it's me..........
La da da......

Rumor 
Out with the old, new summer blues
And wipe the dust off from my shoes
There's so much space behind your eyes
That I wonder....about the vagueness of your views
Don't leave me hanging on
For another night alone
In my dreams I see me running through the fields
My footsteps following my mind
It's funny how I change with time
As I'm watching, waiting for the sign
Of another night alone
The rise and fall of monotony
Is far too familiar to me
When the smoke rises to the ceiling
It makes me wonder....will it remember me?
Don't leave me hanging on
For another night alone
In my dreams I see me running through the fields
My footsteps following my mind
It's funny how I change with time
As I am watching, waiting for the sign
Of another night alone....
When rumors travel on the wind
And you don't know just where they've been
You know they're only careless lies
But you still wonder....you wonder why?
Don't leave me hanging on
For another night alone
In my dreams I see me running through the fields
My footsteps following my mind
It's funny how I change with time
As I am watching, waiting for the sign
As I am watching, waiting for the sign....
Of another night alone...

Set Me Free 
I shoulda kept my jacket on to protect me from this
violent weather. Twist the knife a thousand times but
I can't feel I"m made of leather. There's something
else you never understood about me.....i"m at the
wall. Defying all my laws of reason, high from the
drug, I"m clever. Elastic nerves give the impression
that i"m here forever. Alive in every corner of my
mind, I stand tall.
It's real in my head, I feel it in my soul, you'll
always be a part of me I know. And coast to coast I'll
ride, knowing there's so much more that's inside. And
it'll set me free...........
How many times did you think I would show you my
pride? How many times did you think that I would
swallow it down? In regard to your deceiving I"m
receiving this reward. Relief from all the thoughts
that always lingered on my head. Relief from all the
messed up feelings when you're laying in my bed. I"m
trading it all away for false security.........
I'll race out of control, basking in the light, of all
that is ahead of me and I, will chase til I am weak.
It's there for the taking..........

Sleepwalker 
Back off from me 
I don't need your thrills anymore 
That spell you cast over me 
It doesn't work as well as it did before 
While all the others line up 
In front of you, one by one 
You decide what you were never meant to 
Decide 
Captivated, Trapped behind 
The subconscious wall of a mastermind 
I see 
What would've become of me 
I've never seen so many faces so empty 
Leave now, don't contemplate it 
I should escape while I'm not sedated 
But what about my friends 
And the death wish that the reaper sends 
Follow me 
And I'll take away your pain 
Then I'll take away 
What's left inside your brain 
Good people say their prayers 
And they think that you hear 
Nevermind their souls 
You make a profit from their fears 
Who will bear witness 
When everybody's gone 
I...am left behind 
I lived to see the dawn

State Of Ours 
Remember when
We used to talk?
What you told me before?
Hints of laughter, hints of pain
From both sides
You only talked about yourself
Said I wouldn't understand
Living in my painted world
If you only knew 
What you thought you knew
Then you could spread your wings
It's my life 
Don't tell me everything's alright
???Not really??? doesn't mean never
In disguise we all have our own lives
But you'll never see things
The way that I do
It seems so bad
The state your in
When you're alone
If it doesn't stay that way
And the pity stops
Where will you turn?
You never want to say that you feel bad
For someone else
Or feel their pain
But if you only saw that side 
You'd see that they're the same as you
They've been knocked down
It's my life 
Don't tell me everything's alright
???Not really??? doesn't mean never
In disguise we all have our own lives
But you'll never see things
The way that I do
It's my life 
Don't tell me everything's alright
???Not really??? doesn't mean never
In disguise we all have our own lives
But you'll never see things

The Beauty Inside 
Sometimes
Alone in my room
With my thoughts
I find the answers
That I need
And sometimes 
In the glare of the sun
People standing and staring
I try to find the words 
To make them stay
Or go away
But I have none
Where they go
I'll never understand why
When I need them the most
All I need, all I need
Is love
And all I need
Is you
And all I need
Is faith
To help me through these darkest days
Violent ways that arise
The ever darkening skies
Don't you know that we could paint right over this life
And all I need, all I need
Are the words to say to you
Searching my mind
All that you'll find
Is the presence of you
And the intensions of me
Knowing something's creeping in
I just can't get it out
This beauty in front of me
My emotions are wide
I am so tired
Of these beatings on my head
And I'm running out
And if I lose my space in time
When I drift away 
Thinking of you
Where they go 
I'll never understand why
When I need them the most
All I need, all I need
Is love
And all I need
Is you
And all I need
Is faith
To help me through these darkest days
Violent ways that arise
The ever darkening skies
Don't you know that we could paint right over this life
And all I need, all I need
Are the words to say to you
Something's in my head
Something in those words I said before
I need to 
Well I need to find the thing that brings those words to you
My intuition has grown
And there's a premonition known to me
That when I open my mind and my heart
This beauty inside will rise up into you 
My intuition has grown
And there's a premonition known to me
That when I open my mind and my heart
This beauty inside will rise up into you
This beauty inside
This beauty will rise up into you
When I open my mind
This beauty inside will rise up into you
Rise up into you...

This Love 
I could tell you now, if all were lost I'd still be rich, if I had you. Cuz good times come and go, but if they left for good I know we'd make it through. And I hold you now, here in my heart. I hold you, everyday. Can't imagine life, any other way............ I call you my love, I call you everything, though time may wither us it won't wither the One thing that brought us to this place. The reason I see it all upon your face, this love. No matter where you are, I see you feel you hear you deep within my soul. And nothing in this world, can fill that void because it's you that makes me whole. I call you my love, I call you everything, though time may wither us it won't wither the One thing that brought us to this place. The reason I see it all upon your face. This love is something more than we both know, this love........... Someday I hope I'll understand just how you make me feel the way I do.

You Didn't Mind 
I found a little baby by the telephone, said it's never to early to learn,
The lesson of life that waits for you and me.....
If it were true then would it be so bad?
Or would it cause all my bridges to burn?
Then I could be with me, all that I have is me.....
You didn't mind,
You didn't mind, wasting this heart I surrendered.
You didn't mind, you didn't mind.........
You didn't mind, 
You didn't mind, pouring the salt in this tender wound in me,
This tender wound in me.....
It doesn't concern me....it doesn't make me mad,
I missing on the rock that I thought I did, but never really had.
Don't seduce me, cheap wine that's flowing in our veins,
Is not enough to make me feel,
That this could be any other way.
And it's me, all I have is me.....
This pain is thrown to my rear, this logic numbing my fear,
These walls stand guard on both sides, I see it all to clear...
No time to be insecure, my faith is totally pure, in the one...........
And there's no place, there's no room, for this gloom, or this wounded me.......

Even If 
Even if the sun refused to shine
Even if we lived in different times
Even if the ocean left the sea
There would still be you and me
Ever since the start of time
You've had my love (oh yeah)

I knew your heart (oh girl)
In the dark of the darkest night
I can see your face (yeah)

I would find a way

Even if the clouds would shed no tears
Even if tonite was juz a dream
There would still be you and me
You've always been there and you'll always will be

Until forever you hold me girl (until forever)
I'll never know (ohh..)
In the cold of a winter's chill
I'll be there tomorrow (oh'll)

From the very start
One love, now and forever
Nothing can tear us apart

Through the door
Vule vu, vule vu

C'est la vie

You were made for me
Ah ah ah ah

This is the night
I'm gonna make my move
Get everything right
I'm gonna drive the sweet
Of you an champane on ice
I'll be your sugar and spice
And everything nice
I may not be
What you had in mind
But if I get my act together
It's just a matter time
I'm gonna tap
On your shoulder
I'm from a long time
To hold ya
Showin' you that
You need a lover
Who can be
So smooth never met
So fine that

That way I'll make

You look to me
Dang, girl excuse my french
I can't believe how good
You look to me
Well here we are
Movin' to the beat
I feel like a foolish dancer
With two left feet
I seem to fall flat on my face
'Cause when it comes to love 
I feel so out of place
I'm try to be
The man of your dreams
But every time I look at you
I get off from the seat and fall
I'm gonna tap on your shoulder
I'm from a long time to hold ya
Showin' you that you need a lover
Who can be so smooth never met
So fine that
I'll drive you crazy
That way I'll make
You my baby
Dang, girl excuse my french

How good you look to me

Don't be afraid of me

Tangled in your aura
Girl shinin' for your love
She adore, she adore

Through the door
Vule vu, vule vu

Buon Compleanno 
Sembrava cos? diverso solo adesso ho capito cos'?,
lampante che qualcosa rotto
ma non so mentire se si tratta di me stesso,
guarda ? un incubo senza di te
solo in mezzo a questo mondo...che mio non ?...
Sento freddo anche se ? giugno ,cos? freddo e non capisco
perch? mi hai abbandonato con me
che mi agito solamente non reagisco solo incasso,
pugni d'amarezza sul mio stomaco...
mi infrango sui ricordi di te ...
e ti auguro... Buon compleanno Giulia solo adesso ti capisco, buon compleanno Giulia vita non ? solo come noi.. buon compleanno Giulia ,suona chiaro come l'aria...che sono ancora pazzo di te...
Sai sto pagando tutto, qua gli sbagli ognuno paga da se..
? giusto anche se avvolte ..lo sai vorrei rifare proprio tutto non ? colpa mia se gli occhi che hai,
rendono la luna rossa , t invidia..
Buon compleanno Giulia solo adesso ti capisco buon compleanno Giulia vita non ? solo come...
buon compleanno Giulia  suona chiaro come l'aria.. che sono ancora pazzo di te..
Se siamo cos? distanti siamo vittime d'orgoglio e non ? sempre il peggior difetto
e non resta che cantare per teper te.. non resta che cantare per te..
buon compleanno Giulia  suona chiaro come l'aria ..che sono ancora pazzo di te..
che sono ancora pazzo di te...

Karike 
Primo pomeriggio di domenica tiro gi? la tenda
mi rendo conto che al rallentatore ? cominciata qua
sta' pessima giornata
paranoicamente mi volto le chiavi ho perso
giuro che ci sto provando e spingo
ma questa porta resta chiusa pi? che mai
non fosse cosi difficile ridare restituire le attenzione che,
che adesso mi circondano.
Karike di te che esplodono qua lungo il passaggio
solitudine e l'abito mio che adesso indosso
firma inconfondibile il marchio evidente sul petto
Karike di te che esplodono qua,
che esplodono qua proprio qua accanto a me,
proprio qua accanto a me.
Quasi mi vergogno a dover chiedere
a dover chiedere a me stesso
se ? giusto stare sotto a queste nuvole che portano tempesta.
Mi costa fatica piegare l'indole
di questa mia vita non ? impossibile
mi sento le dita qualsiasi cosa tocco rendo preziosa.
Freddo metallo per quanto pu? valere
pezzo di ghiaccio almeno un minimo
di sentimento e cerco per me ? essenziale ma non riesco a regalartelo,
non fosse cosi difficile ridare restituire le attenzioni che
che adesso mi circondano
Karike di te che esplodono qua lungo il passaggio
solitudine e l'abito mio che adesso indosso
firma inconfondibile il marchio evidente sul petto
Karike di te che esplodono qua,
che esplodono qua proprio qua accanto a me,
proprio qua accanto, proprio qua accanto a me,
proprio qua accanto.
Firma  inconfondibile il marchio evidente sul petto
Karike di te che esplodono qua, che esplodono qua,
che esplodono qua proprio qua accanto a me.

Con solo verte mi mundo cambia de color
Cuando te escucho
No se describir la emocion
Cuando hablamos de noche antes de ir a dormir
Me dejas sonriendo y todo el dia pensando en ti
Se que ests lejos hoy pues yo tambien lo estoy
142 dias faltan para verte 
Y cuento cada segundo..
Porque te adoro!
WoooO!!
Quiero tenerte...
Hoy maana y por siempre
Eres perfecta..
No sales de mi mente!
Cada cosa que haces me pone feliz
Me tienes distraido y todo el dia pensando en ti!
Se que ests lejos hoy pues yo tambien lo estoy
142 dias faltan para verte ...
Y cuento cada segundo..
Porque te adoro!
Y a veces me pongo triste porque estas muy lejos 
Y ya me haces falta...
Y miro tu foto...
Y se borra la distancia...

Just like the sun, 
Light up the earth, 
You light up my life.
The only one I ever see
With a smile so bright
Just yesterday
You came around my way
You change my whole scene way
With your astonishing beauty.
Oh, you could make a brighter scene
An ordinary thing
A supernatural being
And oh, you are brighter than the moon
Brighter than the star
I love you just the way you are.
Girl, 
You are my african queen
The girl of my dreams
You take me where I've never been
You make my heart go ting-a-ling-a-ling
Oh and, you are my african queen
The girl of my dreams
And you remind me of a thing
And that is the african beauty.
Out of a million
You stand out tall
The outstanding one
I look into your eyes
Girl what I see is paradise
You captivated my soul
Na everyday I want you mooooore
How can I deny this feeling
I'm feeling inside
No one gonna take your place
Gonna take your step
It's a fact that cannot erase
And oh, you are the one that makes me smile
Make me flow like a boat upon the nile
Girl, 
You arte my african queen
The girl of my dreams
You take me where I've never been
You make my heart go ting-a-ling-a-ling
Oh, you are my african queen
The girl of my dreams
And you remind me of a thing
And that is the african beauty.
You are my african queen
And I know see I know
You are my african queen
And I know see I know
See I know what I am feeling
In my heart and in my soul
Oh I know that is love
And I know that it love
Was surely sent from up above
Cos you're the only one that I think of
You are my african queen
And I know that this means that
You're the only one that I reserve
I give you
My heart, my soul, my body and my money
Any other thing you think of
In a man, who could think of anything better than you
Who could think of ever hurting you
Sacrifice my all I've given unto you
You are my african queen for real

Where them go respect my skills for instance
Where them no go dey play pranks

Nfana Ibaga 
Echo Yeah 
I'm coming out straight this time 
I'm coming out with a little piece of my own kind of piece of mind 
I'm doing it my way this time 
Liek I'm not gonna bore you with some flimsy kind of piece of rhymne 
So pull a cushion, sit back relax and listen 
To this introduction of me, myself and my mission 
My vision is to let you all see 
That there's more to this life than just faking up reality 
I wake up in the morning and I stretch out my feet 
Say a thank you prayer then I brush up my teeth 
A little exercise then I grab something to eat 
Put on a piece of clothing and then step out into the street 
The into the studio just to hook up some beat 
Later to the club to make the people feel the heat 
Make an honest living and I'm proud about it 
Making sure that all my mistakes I dont repeat 
Like I mind my own business and I dont give a shit 
I say whats on my mind I dont have time to edit 
Got to thank the Lord that He's helped me find my feet 
Oh praise the Lord he give me power to defeat 
If you give me stoneness they got to give me meat 
I try to find it and I try to forget it 
Everybody know that me too lazy to quit 
Everybody know that me physically fit 
Everybody know that me humble and cool 
But some poeple them take me for a fool 
Nfana Ibaga 
Never give another one yawawo 
So the reason why I say nfana ibaga 
Is that I got my conscience by my side 
Got piece of mind inside 
Nfana Ibaga 
No matter what I do I'm going to make my dough 
So the reason why I say nfana ibaga 
Is who has this, no man can curse 
No man can curse 
No man can curse 
Today is the first day of the rest of my life 
I got to be strong, got to be ready for the strife 
I know some people will say somethings that will cut like a knife 
I know some people will say that I might never find a wife 
But I'll do my thing my way oh my brother no be fight 
Sometimes I might be wrong sometimes I might be right 
But I'll keep my head straight 
And I'll keep my game tight 
'Cause what I can't see is the future where the pride 
Got to have it all not just the vine 
Got to have it all not by power not by might 
But I can squeeze the cup by day and by night 
And the Almighty Lord He never let me leave His sight 
But upon on top of that I still will do my peope right 
So I promise I go use my music to dey shine the light 
I no go comform I say I know the sight 
I go bear my mind I go bear am black and white 
Just because I say I no finish school 
Some people them they take me for a fool 
Nfana Ibaga 
Never give another one yawawo 
So the reason why I say nfana ibaga 
Is that I got my conscience by my side 
Got piece of mind inside 
Nfana Ibaga 
No matter what I do I'm going to make my dough 
so the reason why I say nfana ibaga 
Is who has this, no man can curse 
No man can curse 
So I say welcome to my world 
Welcome to my world 
Me I get plenty things to talk about yeah 
I say me I get plenty things to yawn about yeah 
No man can curse 
Nfana Ibaga 
Never give another one yawawo 
So the reason why I say nfana ibaga 
Is that I got my conscience by my side 
Got piece of mind inside 
Nfana Ibaga 
No matter what I do I'm going to make my dough 
So the reason why I say nfana ibaga 
Is who has this, no man can curse 
no man can curse 
no man can curse 
Who God has placed no man can curse

She used to live here before
But I don mess up and threw her out the door
Now I don't feel iray like I used to be before
All the things we used to say
All the way we used to dey
How we used to pray
Now there's an emptiness inside of my soul
And they say my melliness dey start to show
And God knows I cannot take it no more
That's why I am asking you
How do I come up with you
[Chorus:]
See, am looking for someone to satisfy me
Looking for someone to love me completely
Looking for someone to show me true love
And am searching for the kind of possibility
For someone to truly love me for me
Someone to come and be my true love

Now loneliness is the order of my days
Since she's gone, I feel like fading away
No, na die I dey

Oh, I cannot take it no more

See, am looking for someone to set my soul free
Looking for someone to love me completely
Looking for someone to show me true love

About being 14 and all filled with needs

It's all the young dudes, who's got the best moves, yea

Who just wants to see you wearing a tight thong
I don't even know what a thong is
But I got an A+ on the teen charm quiz
Sit back relax, and I won't hit on you
Just let yourself drown in my big baby blues 
OK so I'm older than your average teen
But baby I will treat you just like a queen
I'm wise and mature and so generous too
And I'll never use cuss words like hump or screw
A smooth older man, is just what you need
'Cause loving is better at a way slower speed

Wanna be your real heart breaker

My only motivation

Dreams, you know I've got one baby
You

I told you, you can always count on me
What can I do 
To put your mind at ease 
When the sun don't shine

When the rain don't fall
when the wind don't blow
When the earth won't spin

That's when I'll be gone 
When the river dries

When there's not one beat in a single heart
That's when I will stop, stop
Stop loving you
That's when I'll be gone 
I ain't going nowhere
Not if you won't be there
I ain't going nowhere without you 
When the stars disappear
That's when I won't be near
I knew the day I started
I'd always be there for you
Make no mistake
Baby, love is here 
'Cause we are all one, 
the same through 
&
 through
I'm here for you, girl don't be blue
Listen to me, here's what we'll do 
When the sun don't shine
&
 the moon won't glow
When the rain don't fall
when the wind don't blow
That's when I will stop, stop
Stop loving you

Stop loving you

It's been so long since I've seen your face
So long since I've been to first base.
*strike 3 your out*
I really miss the feel of your kiss.
But can I have back my things before 
I get really pissed? 
You had my heart, my soul, my attention
But you walked out my life with my CD collection. 
We're Breaking Up! 
Breaking up is hard enough (oh oh oh oh)
Say you had nothing but I called your bluff.
You got my sweaters, my hat...
I can't find my cat! *meow*
The Hardest Part Of Breaking Up

Yea 2gether's in the house 
Put your hands in the air 
'cause we'll make ya bounce c'mon yea.

So tell me girl, do I have to say please 
or do I have to involve the police.
*We have you surrounded*
There was a time when I'd trust you alone.
I'd call you up girl, but you took my phone. 
You borrow stuff every time I turn my back.
*hey that's mine!* 
I can't believe I went out with a KLEPTOMANIAC!! 
We're breaking up! 
Breaking up is hard enough (oh oh oh oh)
Say you had nothing but I called your bluff.

The Way You Do Me 
Girl the way you do me 
Hey, oh
Girl the way you do me 
Girl my head's on fire 
Since our very 1st kiss 
Dreamed of us 2gether 
Now they're dreamless 
Took me up to your room 
To show me who you are 
The cup is running over
or maybe its your bra 
Girl, the way you do me 
Makes me say wassup 
When you're finished 
I'm on the floor 
Feeling down feeling up 
Girl the way you do me 
Driving me insane 
I never felt this way before 
I tell ya how I'm feeling 
There's no way to begin 
like winning half a million
and then kissing Philbin
Girl I know you're moody 
You blow hot, blow cold, cold 
That's the way I like it 
You're what I want to hold 
Girl, the way you do me 
Makes me say wassup 
When you're finished 
I'm on the floor 
Feeling down feeling up 
Girl the way you do me 
Driving me insane 
I never felt this way before 
Girl, the way you do me 
Makes me say wassup 
When you're finished 
I'm on the floor 
Feeling down feeling up 
Girl the way you do me 
Driving me insane 
I never felt this way before 
Our Paris Blues 
&
 Gap you 
Can't wait to unwrap you 
You know I am feeling you 
Are you feeling me 
If you didn't phone me 
You see my sky turning black 
I wish my mom would loan me 
A couple of Prozac 
But I won't let it get to me 
I know you just forgot 
'Cause girl you're always with me 
Even when you're not 
Girl, the way you do me 
Makes me say wassup 
When you're finished 
I'm on the floor 
Feeling down feeling up 
Girl the way you do me 
Driving me insane 
I never felt this way before

U + Me = Us (Calculus) 
I'm losing my hair
and my vision is shady
Last night I dreamt 
of an over weight lady 
But I need a young thang
to keep up with my pace
to hold me in her arms
and take me straight to second base. 
I know my calculus
it says u + me = us
Sing it Chad for me
I know my calculus
it says u + me = us 
Oh yeah, calculus... 
Yeah, we're 2gether, we're 2gether

I can't even afford to pay my attention 
(can't pay my attention)
not even philosophy can ever come between us

I know my calculus

Ooh baby, oh lord

Visualize 
[Spoken:]
Sometimes we must live through the darkness
in order to see through the light
We must visualize 
Close your eyes, visualize
the most beautiful girl that could be
Just one sight, mesmerize
it's like gazing right in a sea 
Floating down the street
she stands out like a candlelight
When I look in her eyes
I'm not having sight
couldn't change this feeling 
So I walk towards her
with a vision in my mind
With a hand on my face
and a smile on hers
I softly say goodnight 
Close your eyes, visualize
the most beautiful girl that could be
Just one sight, mesmerize
it's like gazing right in to the sea 
Never dreamt of one who posessed
this gift of gold, gift of gold
She sees beyond through the darkest paths
she knows my soul 
Will she be my girl
if she loves this world
will I ever know
When the time is right
she will be my light
She is my angel 
Close your eyes, visualize
the most beautiful girl that could be
Just one sight, mesmerize
it's like gazing right in to the sea 
With a touch of the sand
from a far away land
gazing at perfection in the palm of my hand
A touch from her face
that far away place
there's no one above her
her spirit 
&
 grace 
Close your eyes, visualize
the most beautiful girl that could be
Just one sight, mesmerize
it's like gazing right in to the sea 
Close your eyes, visualize
the most beautiful girl that could be
Just one sight, mesmerize
it's like gazing right in to the sea 
Yeah I'm walking
in the misty air
in my mind my baby is there
Having you in my life
is my only care
sooner so that we can dream 
Close your eyes, visualize
the most beautiful girl that could be
Just one sight, mesmerize
it's like gazing right in to the sea

You're My Baby Girl 
12th of April we decided it was time
I was feeling good, you were looking fine
on the basement floor with TRL behind
You were loving me with Carson Daly on your mind 
You're my baby girl
you know that you are
You're my honeybunch
my sweet lucky star
So put your hand in mine
I will slap your sweet behind
you're my baby girl 
E is for Erin and making out with you
R is for wrong that's what you like to do
I is for eyes that are smiling at me
N is for nasty which we do constantly 
You're my baby girl

You're my honeybunch
my sweet lucky star
So put your hand in mine
I will slap your sweet behind
you're my baby girl 
Hot dogs and hamburger, unzip me please
Erin likes ketchup but go easy on the cheese
I like to look down on her naked from above
She's just like Gwyneth Paltrow

You're The Only One That's Real 
Oohh, ooohhhh 
When you kiss me 
Are you breathless 
When you touch me 
Do you fall apart 
Do you shiver when you dream, when you dream 
Is there a pounding in your heart 
When I talk do you hear 
When I cry do you care 
When I wake up in the morning 
Do you want me there? 
I want you to know me 
I want you to hold me 
To know who I am 
What I want 
When I feel 
You're the only one that's real

'Cause when we kiss 
When we touch 
All I know 
You're the only one that's real. 
When you call me 
Are you smiling, yeah 
When you leave me 
Does it make you sad 
Is there is an emptiness you feel, that you feel 
When we're 2gether are you glad
And by silence 
You told me if I'm crazy console me 
'Cause in each others arms is where I wanna stay. 
I want you to know me 
I want you to hold me 
To know who I am 
What I want 
When I feel 
You're the only one that's real

Time seemed like stopped
i know that it's what I ever wanted
but sittin in the back of car
I realize that it was just 
a short bracket,a short time in my life
experiences make my brain better than before
seeing sad people returning home 
returning on their lifes
I understand I'm just one of those 
people that lives 
few days and 
regret those for rest of life... 
it's rainin'shame and satisfactions 
on the top of car
that's burning km and petrol 
and it's going south
the only way for stop thinkin of it is sleeping
the only way for stop thinkin of you is sleeping more

but today drivin home or before sleep tonite

wish you have a good 2003 without me.

Baby I ain't joking
And its not I'm smoking
I really think your nice [x4]

We are the love that is hard to love
My name is 2Mex metaphor Mort from ork
Looking for my monogamous Mindy
While your girl envy
Desire a girl to befriend me
But not to entirely up in me
I have pictures of a woman that I love in an album day dreaming of a
different out come
I wear my art on my sleeve
As hard as it seems my heart rips apart at the seams and bleeds
[Awol One]
Some times she's so beautiful
Its like when ever she's angry
But why would someone who's so pretty and smart
fall in love with an underground MC
[2Mex]
Ha!
I took you to the darkleaf concert
You said you never heard of them
How cool is that
So I went to your room and read your diary
Took you to the how and showed you turntables
And then my heart stared listening to hip hop blends
Yo fall in love all over again
Baby I ain't joking
And its not I'm smoking
I really think you're nice [x2]
[Awol One]
She doesn't have the Cinderella syndrome
Hard like a drummer summer color skin tone
Shes like a cardiac still beating
From the top of the cloud to the bottom of the reef
The shark smells blood from a mile a way
Shes like a beautiful mermaid with legs
Well I love you so much that I'm hating your guts
And all I need is your everlasting touch
[Awol One]
Some times she's so beautiful
When ever she's angry
But how could someone so pretty and smart
fall in love with an underground MC
[Awol One]
You stuck your head on my chest and you ripped out my heart
While its still beating in your hands
When it gets broke it won't heal or recover
Its this point in time this love we discover
I'm crossing my t's
And dotting my i's
And signing my name in blood
Waters thicker than mud
It never helped to bring up the past
I talk so slow cause my mind moves fast
Because
Some times she so beautiful
It's like when ever shes angry
But why would someone who's so pretty and smart
fall in love with an underground MC
Baby I ain't joking
And its not I'm smoking
I really think your nice [x2]
We are the love thats hard to love

2Mex falcon gentle
The outcome is mental
Inner visions of anarchism essential
From inside the mouth of south central
Which side of your soul should I attend to?
[Verse 1]
Die in a rush never painted with a (?) brush
just like you fearing god was my high school crush
misunderstood up at the prom
misunderstood up under a bomb
still they deliver the silver sonnets
shiver and quiver if you really were ever honest
never was never really upon us
forever was cleverly thrust upon us
gray patients I stay ancient
decayed saint ships
a vapor ray trips in the middle of arcade flips
in a way its our art our came well equipped
I'm buying red don't die on your bed know that I am what's said
code of Zion misled
for I am stormberg
now conformist warm words
torn disturbed the laughing sunrise
collapsing lung size
grasping rasping tongue tied
robots can't feel it in here
boy copy imperial theater
[Chorus x2]
[Verse 2]
Lunar solburn balloon into the auburn
crimson maroon the edge is all burned
over done orange
brothers and sisters over the sun
we will find the courage
to reconnect with the umbilical
to see corrected stand at the pinnacle
if you can memorize your own pin code
then you can energize your within soul
my words of hope they tour the scope
of what you think is hardcore dope
the assorted coats
touchable figure heads
im on the payroll of un touchable bigger heads
im 3 secrets
from losing my life but maybe saving yours today
my rights and wrongs are expandable
tonight's my songs are what I'm sending you

Los Angeles lungs, love in lower lights
Oceans of organic opals overwright
Subliminal sorcerers satellite
Attempt sacrificion after life, after light
Not natural night
Giggling girls, gigabytes
Earth ending, extraterrestrial heights
Lyrically lines lynch the laptop leopard
Each execution emphasizes effort
Synonym surgery, satellite sits
Heatedly(?), I'm hearsay, hollow point hits
Indigenous idiosyncrasies
Pulling pistols upon political enemies
Hard-hider(?) holding Hell's history
Older organs, odd and ?older league?
Pathological purgery
World wide emergency, why wouldn't we
Introduce ideas instantly, intricately
Live and lift off a linear leaf
Leveling off illogically
Several sonic subjects asleep
All audible angels alive asking
Vibrate invisible visionary vaccine
Escape exactly
Tackling those that try to track me
Heartfelt hello to hard heroes hacking
Everyone evolve, elevate eye
"We won" is worth the wait, we wonder why
Obstacle absorb outside
Re-revolutionize your rubbery ride
Leave losers lurking in levels of lye
Don't doubt dissention, deserters will die

Word, word... word, word, word, word

[Awol One]You got one night in town break out
Of the ground baby doll are you down
Only got one night in town
Baby doll are you down
[Verse 1: 2Mex]
Hey yo thank you
For coming out to the sound check
I haven't even started running around yet
We just got here not to long ago
Is it me or did your hair get longer? No?
Why do you still think we met on the legends tour
I know I met you before that I'm just not sure
I think I met you on the flow and tell
I think we just said what's up to each other we didn't know each other
that well
Anyway
Why don't you take me away for part of the day
I'm down if you roll a j
Yo just take me away from this tour van
I'd love to walk around the city holding your hand
So is it all right if I stay with you so
I can pocket the money the promoter gave me for the hotel
Cool you're the best
No ones gonna take that away from you yes yes
So what up now I heard you have a man now
Hey that's cool whatever
I understand how you get lonely yo
Busdriver told that on the other tour you came to his show with some homie
Hey that not your man no more?
That not my business what happens
I'm just letting you know I know that it happened
Hey I know your in the mix
Don't front it sucks we only get to kick it once
Every 6 months
Lets not talk about that tonight
Shoot me back to the venue cuz I got to go rock the mic
Yo really though
I got to get to work
But its so cute you came to my show wearing my shirt
No I don't think that your stalking me its funny
How you chased away the only other girl that wanted to talk to me
But for real though its cool
All the love an affection your giving me is cool
Thank you
For all the drawing pictures and letters
Thank you for letting me kick it with you tonight whatever
Yeah I know you wanna talk about that song
I haven't thought about it in so long
I don't know if you like me or just my music
I like looking in to your eyes just like a muse
Its an even trade
Believe me if I could I would have stayed in a room we haven't made in the shade
[Awol One]
You got one night in town break out
Of the ground baby doll are you down
Only got one night in town
Baby doll are you down

Outro 
Strong winds push away the debris
Another long day decides what to be
Leaves on the trees are the instruments
Believe what you see only in increments
My equals think that I am blind
I find kind people sink into sublime
Power lines clever designs
Flowers vines
Only severed minds say never mind
I'm not nirvana
I just got the words you wanna pour on your medulla oblongata
I have now stood on four continents
I'm searching for more vowels and consonants
Carvings and hieroglyphics
Harboring words is my world specific
From simple characters
To symbols and caricatures
Round cylinders that don't sound similar
Indiana Jones Indian in a zone
Indigenous and never alone
I have decoded it and now I got it
I know that my life is not encoded or robotic
I know the moon is my grandmother
Why am I not in a mood to stand under?
I'm controlled by the kilowatts
I've been sold to the nano bots
Private to general electric
Get their orders at intervals accepted
Don't die in the artificial light
Go out side your hearts the issues figh

Return Of Fernadomania 
Yeah!

The return of Fernandomania
And the chow shall feed them

The return of Fernandomania
And the chow shall feed them
And the chow shall feed them
The return of Fernandomania
[Verse 1]
My name is 2Mex I'm not afraid of the cops I
just live, check to check and I stay hip hop
I got a brand new cd that I know you don't got
I got my own fat section at the mom and pops
And I'm the
Reason that your little brothers not a gangster
I'd like to take a little bit of time to just thank you
for buying imitations to weak toys
you've spawned a new nation of b-boys
the bling bling stuff was a mirage
I got your sister doing head spins in the garage
and you can pass the XO pass the Hennessey
Pass me the X-Clan and Public Enemy
The straight best from the underground west
You should buy a kid a book and not a bullet proof
Vest so if you're wondering why you should even try
All eyez are on me but I'm not ready to die
[Chorus]
So when you feel down like you don't belong
And you actually care about lyrics in a song
I got this brand new drug
And it's the bomb
Its called run back home and hug your mom
And the chow shall feed them
And the chow shall feed them
The return of Fernandomania
And the chow shall feed them
And the chow shall feed them
The return of Fernandomania
[Verse 2]
My name is 2Mex and I'm proud to be brown
In L.A. I got a ghetto pass I'm allowed to be down
I'm a walk into your town like a bum or a clown
As soon as I open my mouth you hear the lyrics sound
I'm a miracle elephant it' s not a miracle (?)
West coast underground hip-hop is relevant
So go ahead and dissolve in the illusion
I know this song won' t solve the resolution
You might catch me in an Escalade
But I don't make hip hop to have sex and get paid
[Chorus]
And the chow shall feed them
And the chow shall feed them
The return of Fernandomania
And the chow shall feed them
And the chow shall feed them
The return of Fernandomania
And the chow shall feed them
And the chow shall feed them
The return of Fernandomania

Foul play
On a summer day bumping De La Soul its a Saturday!
Without the roller skates
Threes no doubt the sun shouts out my daily solar fate
Must get up to motivate
There too much hope out there to cultivate
In this world and out the stratosphere
I'm looking at this girl like yo kiss me out of here
Don't care if your out of beer
Lets go to the trendy spots
And outdated gear
Let the posh
Of the Oshkosh
I paid the cost of the mosh pit to be a lost cause
Lets hit the in-in-out
At the end of the night we get through the old in-in-out
That would be something to dream about
But thats not what I'm really all about
In a crowded room your name I'm calling out
I'm about to bloom in this game ?????
Don't get me wrong and don't put on your make up yet
Lets fight again so that we can have make-up sex
I'll put the Elliot smith in the CD changer
Put your slit back on ill be the city stranger
No need to role play
Just roll with me and well be OK!
[2Mex]
Lets have a friendship uh slash relationship
And if it ends and crashes well just say it isn't shit
Don't say it was wack because you never really know
we might just get back together
You know all of our friends hate us
No one else in Los Angeles wants to date us
You go out with pretty boys and dress up
I go out with a pretty girl that lives to dress up
Is that what you want?
We both know that this is messed up
Yo I'm ready to roll if you would fess up
I can't talk about you no more
I'm looking at the from door
Cant waste my time trying to convince her
Hey! I just met a new girl on friendster
Word up yo
She likes the eels
This girl knows exactly how I fee

Graduation Day 
started the journey 18 years ago
friends would come and friends would go
everyday seemed to be the same
we've run into problems
but who's to blame
who's to blame
even though sometimes it was hard to get along
some of us feel as if we dont belong
memories of adolescent fun
lessons learned and now we're all done
now we're all done
time to get away
time to break free
time to find out what you mean to me
its graduation day and its all been fun
one last day for everyone
a lot of things are on my mind
what to do now its time i tried
try hard with whatever i do
and i just hope we can all pull through
all pull through
time to get away
time to break free
time to find out what you mean to me
its graduation day and its all been fun
one last day for everyone

Well, Haven't You Heard 
Well, haven't you heard
That the time of man is closing
Well, can't you see
That the Son of God is coming

In glory coming to reign

And wages war in righteousness
Holiness and justice and uprightness

And on His head many kingly crowns
He is dressed in a robe of red
By dipped in blood
And He is called

In glory coming
We'll crown Him King of kings
And Lord of lords
Forever and ever and ever
Well, haven't you heard
He's coming

27th Letter 
So I'll wait for something better
Because it isn't you

I'm still depressed

And I'll wait for you, to tell me
Everything will be okay (repeat)

This won't be a lonely night
I promise we won't fight

And my phone didn't ring
You were having fun with him
And it ruined everything, and I said...

This it the way it has to be
I am staying, you are leaving
This isn't fair, we must part.
I know it's gonna break your heart.
But I knew, and I knew
That this would happen
I knew, and I knew
That this would happen.
Ever day of my whole life

So I will try to find a way

Surfs up, time to go

My mind is somewhere else but I don't know where
My thoughts have been dismissed
Chorus:
I don't know when
And I don't know where
But one thing I know is I'll get there
Maybe not today
Maybe not next year
But for right now I am here
The tide is down and so am I
I am drowning now but not for long
My breath is running out
The wind has blown, the sun is gone
I am tired now but I'm not asleep
My eyes are open wide

But then you came along and picked me up
Off of the ground

The Legend (Chapter 6) 
I look toward the moon and wonder, 
"What doth she have in that heart of cheese?" 
If it were glee and joy and love for me, I'd see it. 
Surely I would when she asked, "please. Oh pretty please." 
And what would my answer be, if then she requested something free. 
A kiss, a nudge, a little bump, 
A lovely pat upon the rump. 
I think, that I think not. 
Yes... 
That's what I think. 
I heard a mysterious tapping, 
Just outside the Big Adventure. 
So, i tapped back 
mmmmm rhythm... 
It was a cool rhythm 
So, I opened the hatch... 
That's when I saw him..... 
I thought he was only a legend, but now, there he was... 
"Don't be frightened! You have nothing to fear, 
For the coolest place you seek, is nearer than near." 
So, I thought to myself... 
"I should offer him a cool refreshment. 
To sip on while he's chillin' . 
Something satisfying, yes. 
But never fillin'." 
He took a taste and said... 
"You've traveled far, my friend, and you've done your best. 
Soon, you'll know the secret that ends your quest of all quests." 
Then, I felt a cold, cold breeze... 
I must be very close. 
Then i heard a voice... 
"Someday, you're gonna be real famous." 
"Someday, you're gonna be real famous." 
What shall I do?
What doth she have in that heart of cheese?
Oh pretty please?
I must be very close...
Stop, come back!

Death Row
That's where motherfuckers is endin up
Dear mama, I'm caught up in this sickness
I robbed my adversaries, but slipped and left a witness
Wonder if they'll catch me, or will this nigga snitch
Should I shoot his bitch, or make the nigga rich?
Don't wanna commit murder, but damn they got me trapped
Hawkin while I'm walkin, and talkin behind my back
I'm kind of schizophrenic, I'm in this shit to win it
Cause life's a Wheel of, Fortune here's my chance to spin it
Got no time for cops, who trip and try to catch me
Too fuckin trigger happy, to let them suckers snatch me
Niggaz gettin jealous (jealous) tryin to find my stash
Whip out the nine, now I'ma dive and pump your ass
Peter picked a pepper, but I can pick a punk
Snatched him like a bitch, and threw him in the trunk
The punk thought I was bluffin, but swear I'm nothin nice
Before I take your life, first wrestle with these, mics
I listen to him scream, Tray Deee went insane
I guess the little, mites had finally found his brain
New Rovers pull me over, I'm sentenced to the pen
Remember that little, bird, he snitched and told a, friend
It's trouble on my mind, I'm with the old timers
And fuck five-oh, blaow blaow.. turn em into forty-niners
[Tupac sings]
Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive, when the ghetto's where you live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin like a thief, runnin through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go...
Where they find me?  16 on Death Row
Dear mama, these cops don't understand me
I turned to a life of crime, cause I came from a broken family
My uncle used to touch me, I never told you that
Scared what you might do, I couldn't hold you back
I kept it deep inside, I done let it fuel my anger
I'm down for all my homies, no mercy for a stranger
The brother in my cell, is 16 as well
It's hard to adapt, when you're black and you're trapped in a livin Hell
I shouldn'ta let him catch me
Instead of livin sad in jail I coulda died free and happy
And my cellmate's raped on the norm
And passed around the dorm, you can hear his asshole gettin torn
They made me an animal
Can't sleep, instead of countin sheep, niggaz countin cannibals
And that's how it is in the pen
Turn old and cold, and your soul is your best friend
My mama prayed for me
Tell the Lord to make way for me, prepare any day for me (why?)
Cause when they come for me they find a struggler
To the death I take the breath from your jugular
The trick is to never lose hope
I found my buddy hangin dead from a rope, 16 on Death Row
[Tupac sings]
Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive, when the ghetto's where you live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin like a thief, runnin through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go...
Where you find me?  16 on Death Row
Dear mama, they sentenced me to death
Today's my final day, I'm countin every breath
I'm bitter cause I'm dyin, so much I haven't seen
I know you never dreamed, your baby would be dead at 16
I got beef with a sick society that doesn't give a shit
And they too quick to say goodbye to me
They tell me the preacher's there for me
He's a crook with a book, that motherfucker never cared for me
He's only here to be sure
I don't drop a dime to God bout the crimes he's commitin
on the poor, and how can these people judge me?
They ain't my peers and in all these years, they ain't never love me
I never got to be a man, must be part of some big plan
to keep a nigga in the state pen
And to my homies out buryin motherfuckers
Steer clear of these Aryan motherfuckers
Cause once they got you locked up
They got you trapped, you're better off gettin shot up
I'm convinced self-defense is the way
Please, stay strapped, pack a gat every day
I wish I woulda known while I was out there
Now I'm straight headin for the chair
[Tupac sings]
Bye bye, I was never meant to live
Can't be positive, when the ghetto's where we live
Bye bye, I was never meant to be
Livin like a thief, runnin through the streets
Bye bye, and I got no place to go...

 Ahh shit, you done fucked up now -- 
Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party

motherfuckin place at the same      
Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party
motherfuckin time, hahahahah
Y'all niggaz about to feel this     
Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party
Break out the champagne glasses
and the motherfuckin condoms
Have one on us aight??            
Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party
[Verse One:  2Pac, Snoop]
Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Bomb the hoochies with precision my intention's to get richer
With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg my fuckin homey
Youse a cold ass nigga on them hogs
Sho nuff, I keep my hand on my gun, cuz they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom waitin on the outcome
Free Tupac, is all that's on a niggaz mind
But at the same time it seem they tryin to take mine
So I'ma get smart, and get defensive and shit
And put together a million march, for some gangsta shit
So now they got us laced
Two multimillionare motherfuckers catchin cases (mmm)
Bitches get ready for the throwdown, the shit's about to go down
Uhh, me and Snoop about to clown
I'm "Losin My Religion", I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin
Niggaz be actin like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
I got, nuthin but love, for my niggaz livin lavish
I got a pit named P, she niggarino
I got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
and I, think I got a black Beamer
but my dream is to own a fly casino
like Bugsy Seagel, and do it all legal
and get scooped up, by the little homie in the Regal
Mmm, it feel good to you baby bubba
Ya see, this is for the G's and the keys motherfucker
Now follow as we riiiiide
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the West side
And I can make you famous
Niggaz been dyin for years, so how could they blame us
I live in fear of a felony
I never stop bailin these, motherfuckin G's
If ya got it better flaunt it, another warrant
2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted
[Chorus:]
Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party
Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party

 Nuthin but a gangsta party...      
Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party
Nuthin but a gangsta party

motherfuckin gangsta party          
Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party 
Nuthin but a gangsta party
it ain't nuthin but a
motherfuckin gangsta party          
Ain't nuttin but a gangsta party
[Verse Two: 2Pac, Snoop]
Now give me fifty feet
Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
And keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, suffering is grief
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck wit me
I bust and flea, these niggaz must be crazy what??
There ain't no mercy motherfuckers who can fade the Thugs
(hahah right) You thought it was but it wasn't, now dissapear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player
It's like cuz, blood, gangbangin
Everybody in the party doin dope slangin
You got to have papers in this world
You might get your first snatch, before your eyes swerl
Ya doing ya job, every day
And then you work so hard til ya hair turn gray
Let me tell you about life, and bout the way it is
You see we live by the gun, so we die by the gun's kids
They tell me not to roll with my glock
So now I gotta throw away
Floatin in the black Benz, tryin to do a show a day
They wonder how I live, with five shots
Niggaz is hard to kill, on my block
Schemes for currency and doe related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm tryin to get up on it
My nigga Dogg with me, eternally the most wanted
[Chorus (w/ variations to end)]

Yeah, you got the Live Squad in this motherfucker
We got my nigga Treach from Naughty by Nature in this motherfucker
My nigga Apache up in this motherfucker
[Verse One: Tupac]
My Mossberg goes boom, gimme room, can I catch it
Talkin quick and then I vic just tryin to keep from gettin blasted
I had enough I put a hit upon them bastards
Boo-yaa!  Turned a snitch into a casket
Now they after me, prowling for a niggaz bucks
Time to see, who's the G, with the bigger nuts
Buck buck, big up and livin reckless
Niggaz with a death wish step in with a Tec and I'll wet this
Yeah this shit is hyper
Two to one I'm writing representing and I'm striking like a viper
Huh, I got my mind made up, I got my nine
Ring the alarm, and strong arm must run
Some niggaz need to feel me with a passion
I'm old fashioned, run up on me nigga and get blasted
With five deadly venomz
(Yeah 'Pac, fuck that, still hittin em up with
that old deadly shit.  Aiyyo Treach where you at?
Step up and hit they ass up with the wickedness.)
[Verse Two: Treach]
We come to hit you with a sock full of Brooklyn
to the Onyx of your nose, punk is funky like skunk blunts
Stunk like funk cunt
I come to take you on a war rough and rugged route
And if another doubts I blow your fuckin mother out
And that's the street scarred style
I shout I'm-de-MC-wit-de-nasty-mouf, and kick the bitch out
Sue me?  I pay the lawyer for ya oh boy yeah
Plus my style's ten to twenty fuckin pounds more
I take you quicker than a picture of a punk ya pickin shit
pickin pockets with a razor stoppin Russian rockets
Not shoplift, I'm liftin shop
Once you sound hot, cause if you ain't a perfect ten
my sign is stop!
It's twenty mother-crooked-fuckin styles in em
Like women I did em I'm in for deadly ready venom
[Verse Three: Live Squad]
Yeah, as I take a puff I get rough, Big Mad
To put it on, can't none come tougher see
I'm down with the sound of the Squad hard, boom!
Breakin em down, I make em see their doom
Coming straight from the dome where I roam it's a job to
rob and steal and runnin from the coppers
Who hold a, boulder, turn the gun controller
Started from a punk now to be a high roller
Youngest, reckless, crazy, disaster
Mac-11 blaster, and I run faster
Than a lot of cops I can't be stopped till my head gets popped
A lot of fuckin bodies will drop
It's a disaster, I'm coming for the blood splatter
I make you scatter, leavin trails of brains and bladders
Blowin em out the frame with no shame
Game tight, drop a body then get out of sight
Count my loot after I shoot, leave my kicks up and it's
something I don't wanna do, somethin that I never did
I try to get him, I think I hit em, I lit him
He's out!  A poison, a deadly venom
(Yeah Mad, fuck that!  You know how we do.
KnowhatI'msayin?  Squad in effect, YG'z in effect.
Now you know a nigga like me gotta represent)
[Verse Four: Live Squad]
Once again, back to rip shit, quick on the flip tip
The psycho, represent the real to take the mic flow
Deadly, rock a head G, check the melody
Niggaz can't touch me when I wreckin G you better flee
Cause I'm gifted with a jab and a forty-four Mag
So nigga flip or take a trip in a body bag
Uhh, boom you slipped up, now you're zipped up
Yeah one more statistic, fronted and got ripped up
No joke, you be yolk, no matter how it sound
We're taking over eight niggaz back to the stomping grounds
Line em up single file, dome runnin in em
A nigga hit em with the venom, the fourth deadly venom
(Nigga, yaknowhatI'msayin?  Fuck that!
I told you, we takin over, yo 'Pac.)
[Verse Five: 2Pac]
Five deadly venomz verse five be the livest
Strugglin and strive, keep a nine in my waistline
Take mine, you better bury me, G
Punk ass niggaz don't even worry me, see
I got a glock that say 'Pac run the block
Fuck the cops cause my gauge gets me... PAID
As I sit and reminesce about the old days
Hugging on my AK, fuck getting played, hey
I say niggaz need to get they mind right
Until they do I pop a clip and grip my nine tight
Now it's on everday could be my last day
That's why I blast on they ass as I past let the glass spray
First you had a mouth full of fronts
Now you're mouth's full of chunks, Pac's out puffin blunts
Deadly venomz
(Hahaha, yeah pass that shit over here.
Apache bout to clean shit up.)
[Verse Six: Apache]
Throw up your middle finger!  Start the track for the maniac
Only thing I'm givin out is black donuts and dirty backs
Let me tell how you rough I get
I pop shit behind your back get in your face and pop the same shit
You can't get in because my gate's bigger I'ma snake nigga
My act guards me so hard I pull the fuckin trigger
I'm a section to clinch your porch is like a pinch
Test a rhyme I'll knock your hairline back an inch
Fuckin up pooh-butts, cut em like cold cuts
Choke em with my boot lace, then leave em hangin like old nuts
Clip up and move out, time to get em
That's the results of fuckin with the fifth venom in denim
(Yeah, yaknowhatI'msayin?
Five motherfuckin deadly venomz, in effect for ninety-three
ninety-four ninety-five all that other shit.
We takin this motherfucker over this larger hit.

A Crooked Nigga Too 
[Intro]
Yeah nigga
Yo Pac (That's right) 
Yo, I heard you got beat up by the police 
Got a big fat lawsuit and everything (yeah)
Niggaz just wanna know if your still gonna be on some crooked ass nigga shit
[2pac Verse 1]
Please tell me what's a nigga to do and it's true
Ain't nuttin' new so I do what I can to get through
Now first they had me trapped and now I'm pissed
A loaded AK47 layin on my hips so don't trip
One motherfucker from the underground
And Big Stretch buckin' niggaz if they fuck around
Yo, why ya'll got beef with police?
Ain't that a bitch them motherfuckers gotta beef with me
They make it hard for me to sleep
I wake up at the slightest peep and my sheets are 3 feet deep
I guess it's hard for you to see 
But now I'm pointin the finger at police instead of motherfuckers blamin' me
I got the right to bear a pistol
And when them punk motherfuckers get to trippin' I got shit too
And maybe then you'll see the truth
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
[Chorus]
It's all up to you
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth (awwwwww)
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
It's all up to you
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth (awwwwww) Oooh!
You can't fuck with the crew, a crooked nigga too
[2pac Verse 2]
You know you really can't say that you blame niggaz
Fuck bein' tame, set a flame, tryin' to aim triggaz
2pac'll spark a revolution, fuck the constitution
I want my bucks for restitution
This time you got a bigger problem
Time to face the niggas from South Central, Oakland, Brooklyn and Harlem
And we ain't shootin' at eachother (fuck no), that's a motherfuckin' brother
So save two, run for cover
And other bitches from the clan
Come feel the wrath of a black man that doesn't smoke crack and
I don't drink St. Ides (fuck that!) 
Genuine draft ganja ganja and my fuckin' Tec-9
They know their scared to see us sober (awwwww)
Cobra - And niggaz will take the world over
It's all up to you (up to you) Blame the Korean (fuck that)
I'll be a crooked nigga too
[Chorus]
It's all up to you
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth (awwwwww)
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
It's all up to you
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth (awwwwww) Oooh!
You can't fuck with the crew, a crooked nigga too
[2pac Verse 3]
Pardon me, ?? has been God and try me
I'll be damned if I die come look at the rage in my eyes G
They got my homies in a jail cell
Now it's the rebel and the devil and one of us is goin' to hell
I got the whole place covered with loc'ed out brothers
And nothing but love for eachother
So motherfucker make a motion
I give a fuck, slice you up, and throw your ass in the ocean
Temperatures drop
See it's cool to shoot a nigga but they hate it when we pop the cops
That's when they gettin' petrol
You better watch your step or you'll be left on deathrow
But I learned to look ahead of me
Stay strapped, watch your back, keep your eyes on the enemy
We blowin' up precincts and oooohhhh you can't fuck with the crew
A crooked nigga too
[Chorus]
It's all up to you
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth (awwwwww)
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
It's all up to you
But until then I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth (awwwwww) Oooh!

One love, one love, one thug
One nation, twenty-one gun salute
I'm hopin my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio, gettin blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke
Twenty-one gun salute, dressed in fatigue, black jeans and boots
Disappeared in the crowd, all you seen was troops
This little nigga named Nas thinks he live like me
Talkin bout he left the hospital took five like me
You living fantasies, nigga I reject your deposit
We shook Dre punk ass, now we out of the closet
Mobb Deep wonder why nigga blowed them out
Next time grown folks talk, nigga close your mouth
Peep me, I take this war shit deeply
Done seen too many real players fall to let these bitch niggas beat me
Puffy lets be honest you a punk or you will see me with gloves
Remember that shit you said to Vibe about me bein a thug
You can tell the people you roll with whatever you want
But you and I know what's going on
Payback, I knew you bitch niggas from way back
Witness me strapped with Macs, knew I wouldn't play that
All you old rappers trying to advance
It's all over now, take it like a man
Niggas lookin like Larry Holmes, flabby and sick
Tryin to player hate on my shit, you eat a fat dick
Let it be known this is how you made me
Lovin how I got you niggas crazy

Against all odds, up in the studio, gettin blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke, against all odds
Hopin my true motherfuckers know

I heard he was light skinned, stocky with a Haitian accent
Jewelery, fast cars and he's known for flashing (What's his name???)
Listen while I take you back (NIGGA SAY HIS NAME!) and lace this rap
A real live tale about a snitch named Haitian Jack
Knew he was workin for the feds, same crime, different trials
Nigga, picture what he said, and did I mention
Promised a payback, Jimmy Henchman, in due time
I know you bitch niggas is listenin, The World Is Mine
Set me up, wet me up, niggas stuck me up
Heard the guns bust but you tricks never shut me up
Touch one of mine on everything I own
I'll destroy everything you touch, play the game nigga
All out warfare, eye for eye
Last words to a bitch nigga, "WHY YOU LIE?!?"
Now you gotta watch your back, now watch your front
Here we come, gunshots too Tutt, now you stuck
Fuck the rap game, nigga this M-O-B
So believe me we enemies, I go against all odds
I'm hopin my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio, gettin blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke
I'm hopin my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds
Puffy gettin robbed like a bitch, to hide the fact
he did some shit he shouldn't have did, so we ride em for that
And that nigga that was down for me, restin dead
Switch sides, guess his new friends wanted him dead
Probably be murdered for the shit that I said
I bring the real, be a legend, breathin the dead
Lord listen to me
God don't like ugly, It Was Written
(ey yo Nas) Nas, your whole damn style is bitten 
You heard my melody, read about my life in the papers
All my run-ins with authorities, felonious capers
Now you wanna live my life, so what's the answer Nas?
Niggas that don't rhyme right, you've seen too many movies
Load em up against the wall, close his eyes
Since you lie you die, GOODBYE
Let the real live niggas hear the truth from me
What would you do if you was me nigga
Against all odds
I'm hopin my true motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio, gettin blowed
To the truest shit I ever spoke
[repeat]
Against all odds
[Twenty-one gun salute]
One love to my true thug niggas (Outlaw! Outlaw! Outlaw!)
Twenty-one gun salute to my niggas that die in the line of duty
Representin to the fullest bein soldiers with military minds

I salute you my niggas, stay strong

To all you bitch made niggas, I'm comin for you

Ain't Hard 2 Find 
(feat. B-Legit, C-Bo, Richie Rich, E-40)
[Tupac]
 They say
[Intro/Chorus:]
[B-Legit]
Influenced by crime, addicted to grindin
[C-Bo]
Where I can pile up my chips
[Richie Rich]
And niggaz call me a timer
[Tupac]
I been ballin since my adolecsent years steady climbin
[E-40]
Man, you motherfuckers don't know nuttin about no timin
[Tupac]
 That's right, that's right boy start that shit off
[Verse One: 2Pac]
I heard a rumour I died, murdered in cold blood dramatized
Pictures of me in my final stage you know Mama cried
But that was fiction, some coward got the story twisted
Like I no longer existed, mysteriously missin
Although I'm worldwide, baby I ain't hard to find
Why I spend most of my time on California crime
Watching for thievin I'm cautious it's like I'm barely breathin
Puttin a bullet in mutherfuckers give me a reason 
See me and hope I'm intoxicated or slightly faded 
You tried to play me now homicide is my only payment
I'm addicted to currency in this life I lead
Why the fuck you cowards be runnin, too scared to fight a G
For the life of me, I cannot see
How motherfuckers picture livin life after a night of fuckin around with me
And if you don't like this rhyme 
then bring your big bad ass to California, cause we ain't hard to find
[Chorus]
[Verse Two: C-Bo, B-Legit]
I got my locs on hard hat goin to war
Breakin them off on sight, stoppin lives like red lights
Watch em pause as I pull my strap, out my drawers
And get to dumpin on they ass, like the last outlaws
Rich, Tupac and the Click, smokin blunts, loadin clips
With enough shit to raise your block in one dip
We bring on horror like Tales From the Crypt
And we ain't hard to find is the tales that we kick
I'm fully automatic full of static and shit
Movin Dodge van fifty rounds in the clip
I'm ridin shot gun with the tint in the back
I'm plan to have a motherfuckerin mint in this rap
I'm from the V-A-L-L-E-J-O 
Where sellin narcotics is all I know
I got blow, speed, bleed, whatever yo' kind
And if you need a motherfucker I ain't hard to find
Some may call me Bootsy, but I call it timin
That's while I keeps on grindin (that's right)
to the point where a nigga can't stop
Too much feelin this shit, that's why I'm quick to peel a bitch
Whether it's a nigga or a hoe, a hoe
get in my way, then that ass gots to go
Cause a nigga steady plottin
I serves hit for hit, and motherfuckers keep droppin
[Chorus]
[Tupac]
 C-Bo and D-Shot, E-40, Richie Rich
[E-40]
 Da Bay, beitch!
[Verse Three: E-40, Richie Rich]
Down the steps  
Abandonded broken down apartment complex
Heavy metal lipstick hairy can't be scary
Playboy, what the fuck is the proof without the drama play
Nigga, what the fuck you got a gun for, if ya gonna hesitate
Best shake and bake although mine was first to ask niggaz
Motherfuckers didn't think I wasn't going do somethin, ask niggaz
Threaten your life, ain't like you love him
Bury your thoughts, take his head fuck him have at him
Check this out
I grew up with that nigga, threw up with that nigga
I hear he tryin to ride, double-edgin for the other side
But now, my glock be so judgemental
Back seat of a rental keep my name out your dental
Nigga, if your gum bleedin, and you needin
mo' than twenty sticthes, you behaved like dem bitches
Sideways to the race
Heavy in the game, check the resident it's all the same
Nigga, and we ain't hard to find
[Tupac]
 Hell nah we ain't hard to find
[C-Bo]
 The whole clickilation fool
[E-40]
 Motherfuckers hard to find, right here bitch
[Tupac]
Why them niggaz actin like they can't find us
like like they can't see us and
like we don't be at the same spots they be at
It's the same congregation, Young Pac is back
YouknowhatImean?
[C-Bo]
 Nigga be lookin all the way when he see you and shit
It's a celebration, Young Pac is back
[E-40]
 Motherfuckers better understand this shit
[Tupac]

All About U 
(feat. Nate Dogg, YGD Tha Top Dawg)
You probably crooked as the last trick
Wanna laugh about how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch?
Thinking I had her but she had me in the long run
Its just my luck I'm stuck fuckin with wrong one, uh
Wise decisions based on lies we living
Skandalous times is games like my religion
You could be rolling with a thug
Instead you with this sweet scrub
Looking for some love
In every club, I see you standing like you want it
Well baby if ya got it better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin in walls as I pause
Addicted to the fast life
I try to holler but you tell me you're taken
Sayin you ain't impressed with the money I'm make
Guess its true what they telling me
Fresh out of jail lights hell for a black celebrity
So thats the reason why I call
And maybe you with it
Fantasies of the sweatin
Can I hit it? (hahaha)
Addicted to the things you do
Its still true what I'm saying Boo
Cause this is All About U
Every other city we go
Every other video
(its all about you)
No matter where I go
I see the same hoe
[repeat]
I'll make a promise if ya go with me
Just let me know, I'll have you hollering
My name out before I leave
Nobody loves me I'm a thug nigga
I only hang out with the criminals and the drug dealers
I love niggas
Cause we coming from the same place
Witness me holler at a hoochie, see how quick the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa
And I don't even care
Creep though
Weed smokes in the air
Everywhere I go, its all about the groupie hoes
waiting for niggas at the end of every show
I just seen ya in my friends video
Never put you on my friends so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm going through
It's All About U
(Yeah nigga, its All About U)
[Chorus 2X]
Is you sick from the dick or is it the flu?
It ain't about you or your bitch ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty hoe
You think it's all about you?
Well, boo, I gets down like Dru and my nasty new niggas, too
You couldn't hold me back
It'll take a fatter track, a lyrical attack
Or perhaps it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your ?
Straight in control
?Flows are full?
Why hold a cold stroll?
Coldest set
I told you I'm as gold
And that's gold diggin
Cold diggin a ?
I slide in easily
Try a grizzly
Sluts know the cuts
I came to fuck
Try skeezin me
Runnin up in this
It's like ? when I bring ya the most
I fuck a bitch from the West coast
[Chorus 4X]
(You know what I'm saying?)
Every other city we go
I see the same hoes
In the studio, that kickin it in the video
It's gotta be the same ass and thighs
But you's a groupie baby, and don't look surprised
I can see it in your eyes, that you ain't nothing but a trick
Hanging with us, for some superstar dick
Want an autograph placed on her napkin
After she asks "Ain't you the Top Dogg and don't you be rappin?"
She know whats crackin
Peep shows like Luke
From the limos, down to the Lexus coupes
We be flossin, and all females love that
Especially when you're dope, platinum, and your own ?
So when I met you
I really didn't have to say much
Cause me alone
Just made you want to taste and touch
Don't be trippin if I run up in you and your whole crew
I'ma still let you know girl, that it's all about you

You probably crooked as the last trick; want it light
but how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch
Thinkin I had her but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck I'm stuck with fuckin with the wrong one, uh!
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin for some love
In every club, I see you starin like you want it
Well baby if you got it better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla but you tell me you taken
Sayin you ain't impressed, with the money I'm makin
Guess it's true what they tellin me
Fresh out of jail, life's Hell for a black, celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you widdit
Fantansies of us sweatin, can I hit it?  (Hahaha)
Addicted to the things you do, but still true
What I'm sayin Boo, is this is all about you
[Nate Dogg]
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o

No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
(Yeah nigga, ha ha ha ha!)
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
[2Pac]
I make a promise if you go with me, just let me know
I'll have you hollerin my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me I'm a thug nigga; I only hung out 
with the criminals and the drug dealers, I love niggaz
cause we comin from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick, the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa, and I don't even care
Creep though, weed smoke's into the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
waitin for niggaz at the end, of every show
I just seen you in my friend's, video
Could never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin through..
It's all about you.. hahaha, yeah nigga!
It's all about you!
[Nate Dogg]
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
[Outlawz]
Is you sick from the dick, or is it the flu?
It ain't about you or your bitch ass crew
Every other city we go and every video
Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty hoe
You think it's all about you?  Well Boo
I gets Down like Dru and my nasty new niggaz, too
You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Golddiggin, cold diggin a gold Rolex
I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cuts, I came to fuck, try skeezin me
Runnin up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch from the West Coast to West Virginia
[Nate Dogg]
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
(It's all about you)
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
Every other city we go, every other vi-de-o
No matter where I go, I see the same hoe
[Snoop Doggy Dogg speaking over last two lines]
I'm tellin ya, it's the same ol' shit
I mean.. god damn, youknowhatI'msayin?

And then yaknahmsayin what make that even mo' fucked up

Big Syke, Newt, Hank
Beugard, Big Sur (yeah)
Y'all know how this shit go (y'know)
{All Eyez On Me}
Motherfuckin O.G. 
Roll up in the club and shit (is that right?)
{All Eyez On Me}
{All Eyez On Me}
But you know what?
[2Pac]
I bet you got it twisted you don't know who to trust
So many playa hating niggaz tryin to sound like us
Say they ready for the funk, but I don't think they knowin
Straight to the depths of hell is where those cowards goin
Well are you still down nigga?  Holla when you see me
And let these devils be sorry for the day they finally freed me
I got a caravan of niggaz every time we ride (every time we ride)
Hittin motherfuckers up when we pass by (when we pass by)
Until I die; live the life of a boss playa
Cause even when I'm high, fuck with me and get crossed later
The futures in my eyes, cause all I want is cash and thangs
A five-double-oh - Benz flauntin flashy rings, uhh
Bitches pursue me like a dream
Been know to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend
It seems - my main thang was to be major paid
The game sharper than a motherfuckin razor blade
Say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
One nigga's gettin jealous, and motherfuckers died
Depend on me like the first and fifteenth
They might hold me for a second, but these punks won't get me
We got foe niggaz, and lowriders, in ski masks
screamin Thug Life every time they pass {All Eyez On Me}
[Chorus One: 2Pac]
Live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die
live the life of a boss playa {All Eyez On Me}
cause even gettin high.. ..{All Eyez On Me}
Live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die
live the life of a boss playa, cause even gettin high..
[Syke]
Heeyyy, to my nigga 'Pac..
So much trouble in the world, nigga
Can't nobody feel your pain
The world's changin everyday, times moving faaast
My girl said I need a raise, how long will she last?
I'm caught between my woman, and my pistol, and my chips
Triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as I dip
I'm lost in the land with no plan, livin life flawless
Crime boss, contraband, let me toss this
Needy hookers got a lot of nerve, let my bucket swerve
I'm takin off from the curb
The nervousness neglect make me pack a tec
Devoted to servin this, Moet and paaayyy-checks
Like Akai satellite nigga I'm forever ballin
It ain't right parasites triggers and fleas crawlin
Sucker duck and get busted, no emotion
My devotion is handlin my business nigga keep on coastin
Where you goin I been there came back as lonely homie
Steady flowin against the grain niggaz STILL don't know me
It's about the money in this rap shit, this crap shit
It ain't funny niggaz don't even know how to act - shit!
What can I do, what can I say, is there another way?
Blunts and gin all day, twenty-fo' parlay
My little homie G, can't you see, I'm busta free
Niggaz can't stand me - all eyes on me!
[Chorus Two: 2Pac]
I live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live the life as a boss playa {All Eyez On Me}

I live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die
live the life as a boss playa {All Eyez On Me}
cause even gettin high
[2Pac]
The feds is watchin, niggaz plottin to get me
Will I survive, will I die?  Come on let's picture the possibility
Givin me charges, lawyers makin a grip
I told the judge I was raised wrong, and that's why I blaze shit
Was hyper as a kid, cold as a teenager
On my mobile callin big shots on the scene major
Packing hundreds in my drawers; fuck the law
Bitches I fuck with a passion, I'm livin rough and raw
Catchin cases at a fast rate, ballin in the fast lane
Hustle til the mornin, never stopped until the cash came
Live my life as a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live my life as a boss playa, cause even gettin high 
these niggaz got me tossin shit
I put the top down, now it's time to floss my shit
Keep your head up nigga, make these motherfuckers suffer
Up in the Benz burnin rubber
The money is mandatory, the hoes is fully strapped
This criminal lifestyle, equipped with the bulletproof vest
Make sure your eyes is on the meal ticket
Get your money motherfucker let's get rich and we'll kick it
All eyes on me!
[Chorus Three: 2Pac]
I live the life as a thug nigga, until the day I die
Live the life as a boss playa {All Eyez On Me}

All Out 
(feat. Outlawz)
[hellicopter propeller turning]
[Kastro 
&
 Napoleon]
We goin all out (aiiiite)
We goin all out (aiiiite)
We goin all out, watch ya motherfuckin mouth niggaz
(That's right, fuck these fag niggaz)
Do it, do it, do it
[2Pac]
Come hell or high water, down to slaughter opposers
Just another lost soul, stuck, callin Jehovah
Outlaw 'til it's over, brand as my strap
Back like a cobra, I stay drunk, cause I'm a mad man
Whenever sober, on a one man mission
My ambition to hold up the rap game
While I pluck holes in niggaz like donuts
And still down to die for all my souljas
Like hillbillies, they don't fear me
So refuse bringin war to the city
With each breath, death before dishonor
Never let you swallow me, no apologies, your honor
A general in war, I'm the first to bomb
With a squad of trusted killers, quick to move shit heavily armed
I'm similar to Saddam, sometimes I question Hussein
Like fiends frantic for that last vein, stuck in the game
I hit the scene like sandstorms, then transform, watch me
I take the figure of dirty niggaz, who all got me
While bitches wonderin who shot me
No love, keep a grudge, shootin sluggs like Muammar Quadaffi
Murder my friends, build a new posse
We takin shots at paparazzi, go and fly now, nigga like Rocky
You got a lot of nerve to play me
Another gay rapper, bustin caps to Jay-Z
(buck buck buck buck buck buck)
And still avoid capture, while y'all caught up in the rapture
Still after me, I'm in Jamacia sippin daquiris, no doubt
We used to havin nothin, then grabbin somethin and bustin
Wanted to be the thug-nigga, that my old man wasn't
I came to a field, catchin cases, litigation
Niggaz playa-hatin, got me crooked in all 50 states
I'm screamin DEATH ROW, throw my WESTSIDE, ain't no thang
We was raised off drive-by's, brought up to bang
We claim mob, M.O.B. if you be specific
We control all cash from Atlantic-Pacific
And get this, I'm hard to kill, when I peel with this live spot
Father, how the hell did I survive, these five shots?
Live it up, of give it up, and my demons
Late night, hear them screamin; we goin all out!
[Chorus: EDI]
We goin all out, bomb first till they fall out
Take them the war route, without a doubt
Ball, which means we all ride if it's on
Each nigga handle ya own, bring it on strong
If you got bills to pay, nigga go all out
Bustas playin with ya peeps, betta go all out
Try'na see the next day, nigga go all out
Obstacles in ya way, you better go all out
[Napoleon]
I'm on my land sled, walkin through the belly of the beats
Feelin like I'm all out, drunk as can be
It's plain to see, that we mobb niggaz hidin' in bushes
Claimin that they ride rough, but they soft as they cushion
They softer than bitches in the worst way, drownin in blood
Outlawz my blood brothers, I'd die for these thuggs
Say hi to this slug, it's a shame how some niggaz on the west coast
was ridin with Pac, but when he died, they went pop
I'm on the Jers to the fullest, like some west coast love
But after Pac stopped rappin, it ain't no west coast thug
Just westcoast what?  To my real niggaz stuck in the street game
Cause rappers like Jay-Z be pumpin Kool-Aid through they veins
Is it true what I'm sayin?  Slap your soft ass to the floor
And watch my fo-fo put peek holes through your door
I ride or die, but these other fag niggaz be bitin this
It's all from my heart when I was writin this
All out
[chorus]
[Kastro]
Now, we all ride, and down to die who wit us
Speak up, or get treated like you comin to kill us
Ain't nothin but squealers, in this rap game, swearin they rough
Tattooed up, and now them niggaz swearin they Pac
Stop that, and watch ya back, we ain't forgot bout cha
These glocks hot, and when shot, it'll bring the bitch up out cha
It's me, Kastro with the goattee
Walkin' like a OG, cause all these fag motherfuckers owe me
I pray to the thug lord, like that motherfuckers holy
Frontline soulja, till the heavens call me
I go all out, and if you real, you real
Feel what I'm talkin' bout, cause this game is ill
I live it, forbidden fruit, shoot, 'till they feel it
Livin' proof, Pac breed niggaz, they can't deal wit'
Holla back, right back, and watch ya mouth
Or get blood in it, WHAT, we goin' all out 
Nigga
[chorus - 2X]
fool, you better go all out
keep goin' all out
all my niggaz goin' all out
without a muthafuckin' doubt
[EDI talking]
Ey, you niggaz just gon think that you gon be uhh
talkin and slippin on all of these motherfuckin records
and we ain't gon say shit, now it's 1999
It's a different grind, don't disrespect the Don
It's still war motherfuckers
So let's see you act like you know

[2Pac speaking over background]
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind nigga
My ambitions as a ridah!
My ambitions as a ridah!
[2Pac]
So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin without heart
Was born rough and rugged, addressin the mad public
My attitude was, "Fuck it," cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Uhh, and my ambitions as a ridah to catch her
while she hot, and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, "Go to the tele hoe"
Equipped with money and a Benz, cause bitch I'm barely broke
I'm smokin bomb-ass weed feelin crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin and prayers, to breakin motherfuckers to pay-up
I got no time for these bitches, cause these hoes tried to play us
I'm on a meal-ticket mission, want a mil', so I'm wishin
Competition got me ripped, on that bullshit they stressin (boo-yaa!)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's manditory
No guts no glory my nigga bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the bidness so I got with Death Row
Now these money hungry bitches gettin suspicious
Started plottin and plannin on schemes, to come and trick us
But Thug niggaz be on point and game tight (yeah)
Me, Syke and Bogart, wrap it up the same night
Got problems then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggaz is jealous cause deep in they heart they wanna be me
Uhh, yeah, and now ya got me right beside ya
Hopin you listen I catch you payin attention 
to my amibitions as a ridah
[Chorus: 2Pac]
[singing]
 I won't deny it, I'ma straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
[singing]
 My ambitions as a ridah
[singing]
 Got the police bustin at me
But they can't do nuttin to a G 
[Tupac]
(I won't deny it, I'ma straight ridah)
Peep it.. it was my only wish to rise
above these jealous coward mutherfuckers I despise
When it's time to ride, I was the first off this side, give me the nine
I'm ready to die right here tonight, and motherfuck they life (yeah nigga!)
That's what they screamin as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
So open fire, I see you kill me (that's all you niggaz got?) witness my steel
Spittin at adversaries envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama come rescue me I'm suicidal thinkin thoughts
I'm innocent, so there'll be bullets flyin when I'm caught
(Shoot!) Fuck doin jail time, better day, sacrifice
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson
Thuggin for life and if you right then nigga die for it
Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
When it's time to die to be a man you pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah
[Chorus]
[Tupac]
My murderous lyrics equipped with spirits of the Thugs before me
Pay off the block evade the cops cause I know they comin for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
Now I'm back my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds, sure as some bitches bleeds
niggaz'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me but they didn't finish, (buck buck buck buck buck)
didn't diminish my powers
so now I'm back to be a motherfuckin menace, they cowards
That's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggaz on my team, so indeed, they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money, I'll have these motherfuckers buried (I been)
gettin much mail in jail, niggaz tellin me to kill it
Knowin when I get out, they gon' feel it
Witness the realest, a whoridah when I put the shit inside
the cry from all your people when they find her
Just remind ya, my history'll prove I been it
Revenge on them niggaz that played me, 
and all the cowards that was down widdit
Now it's yo' nigga right beside ya
Hopin you listenin, catch you payin attention 
to my ambitions as a ridah
[Chorus 2.5X]

As The World Turns 
[2Pac]
As the world turns..
As the world turns my ni**az grow and grow and grow
and get dough and roll and ride
ni**az die and mommas cry
ni**az got alibis and suicides and homicides
and three strikes and yo' life and my life and times change
And ni**az fame, as the world turns..
Though I walk thru the valley of hell the shadow follows me
Wisdom hard to swallow tomorrow expect apologies
You probably panic, stranded in search of a better planet
Realism hard to understand, we stand slanted
and still stranded, merciless thieves stole the best of me
I pray to black Jesus to please take the rest of me
And still, the best of us build, and reach monetary gains
Some of us kill, but still, most of us can change 
if we search deeper, god bless the hustler, curse the first sleeper
Enemies get beside me, flows go deeper inside
We we ride plots keep all my enemies blinded
Time will soon show, a thought can last for years
Outshinin them fakes smile plastic tears
like last year, ni**az stuck in the past, and it's clear
Just some busta a*s bastards allergic to cash this year
Makaveli for the Mob, M-O-B
Killin bustaz is my motherf**kin job, him or me
Lyrically fatally driven, ni**az reported missin
My competition dead or in prison, as the world turns...
[Chorus: Darryl 'Big D' Harper, (Tupac - in background)]
(Turns.. turns, turns, turns, and turns
My ni**az grow and grow and grow
and gettin dough and dough and dough
from this state to that state
from this cell to that cell, as the world turns)
As the world keeps turnin round and round
It's gon' be goin round as the world turns.. and steady turnin
[Young Noble]
As the world turn burnin paths, starin through my rearview
It's a war goin on, and the President is in too
I hear Tu-Pac sayin, "Watch em they'll kill you"
Sippin Thug Pa*sion, scrub actin like he feel you
Steady plottin, ready or not; Outlawz lost 
but not forgotten, from Gittere to Compton
A spitter of the hotness, long timeness
So like six I ain't never been rich
I need cream, to buy Ellene a dream house
She no longer fiend out y'all, Outlawww
[Napoleon]
Another lonely ni**a with a 12-gage pump
with a 12-hour rush to run and get this money, f**k these punks
Road rules I swim in the dirt, I stay in some skirt
I hit where it hurts, I ride or die for my turf
I ride or die for Makaveli the legendary war thug ni**a
Kadafi betta unslug this ni**a, Seike betta undrug this ni**a
Out of the buildin we street children with no souls
Our hearts gon' stay cold, the war gon' stay on
We serve em, like Pac told us to, catch em wet with the tec
Hit em in the neck and watch him die like he supposed to
Napoleon the front line soldier, front times over
Rider for the mightly dollar rather drunk or sober
ni**a talkin thug walkin all through yo' squad
Y'all ni**az scared by a dog, I got my fo'-fo' for y'all
It's like a hot, heated day homie, warfare don't play homie
Better be prepared than try to dunk away from these strays homie
Worlds turn, thangs burn, all in one shot
Rest in peace to the fallen soldiers, all that we got
As the world turns..
[Chorus: Darryl 'Big D' Harper, (Tupac - in background)]
(And my ni**az roll and ride, hahaha
ni**az gettin swoll out
And it don't stop and it don't quit
That real s**t!  As the world turns..
ni**az die for
How many you ni**az try for this?  As the world turns
Murderin methods.. haha OUTLAW!)
As the world keeps turnin round and round
It's gon' be goin round as the world turns.. and steady turnin
As the world keeps turnin round and round
It's gon' be goin round as the world turns..
[E.D.I. Amin]
Only haters caught feelings, when my homie caught millions
And acquired the desired status of boss livin
We cross driven, cornered into a life that's hellish
Payin our dues with bloodshed, ain't s**t y'all could tell us
Fellas - mount up, it's time for battle, it's on now
Two worlds collidin armies ridin soldiers, gone wild
Sometimes I think my glory days was back in my youth
I sought too for family, but I got it lost in these ounces
Now as the world turns court adjourns, I'm sentenced to burn
The cost of my sins too much, nuttin left to earn
[Kadafi]
October 9th 1977 first day out my baby carriage
Married my Mack-11 hit the block playin
Only five years up in this bi**h, poppa runnin from the Feds
Puttin peanut butter on the walls to hide his prints
Me on my own, not yet grown but only man of the home
to protect my zone in these streets I roam
Dough on d-low, downin straight shots of Cristal Brothers
Hundred dollar snot box on cee-lo, f**k eighth
I need a kilo, got a plot, move my block down state
Got the drop on the spot, movin pounds of weight
f**k my fate and lots of loot to burn, a hustler's yearn
for this dirty money earned as this crooked world turns
[Chorus: Darryl 'Big D' Harper (repeats as Tupac speaks)]
[2Pac]
Hahaha.. as the world turns..
and turns and turns and turns.. haha
This for the soldiers out there involved in the everyday struggle
Hopin to bubble, keep on hustlin, as the world turns

Baby Don't Cry (Keep Ya Head Up II) 
[2Pac]
I feel you {uhh} .. (baby don't)
but you can't, you can't give up
{Hey.. 2Pac what?}
[2Pac + H.E.A.T.]
Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up {Outlawz}
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up {Keep ya head up}
[2Pac]
Now here's a story bout a woman with dreams
So picture perfect at thirteen, an ebony queen
Beneath the surface it was more than just a crooked smile
Nobody knew about her secret so it took a while
I could see a tear fall slow down her black cheek
Sheddin quiet tears in the back seat; so when she asked me, 
"What would you do if it was you?"
Couldn't answer such a horrible pain to live through
I tried to trade places in the tragedy
I couldn't picture three crazed ni**az grabbin me
For just a moment I was trapped in the pain, Lord come and take me
Four ni**az violated, they chased and they raped me
Even though it wasn't me, I could feel the grief
Thinkin with your brains blown that would make the pain go
No! You got to find a way to survive
cause they win when your soul dies
[2Pac + H.E.A.T.]
Baby please don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don't cry, you got to keep your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up
Even when the road is hard, never give up {never give up}
Baby don't cry, I hope you got your head up {never give up}
Even when the road is hard, never give up
Baby don't cry
[Edi Amin]
Uhh
Forget him girl (forget him girl) he ain't gon' never change
ain't no hater but that ni**a lost in the game
After the bright lights and big thangs
he probably could loev you, but he in love with the struggle
Everyday, his mind on gettin mo' (gettin mo')
and never your feelings, he's chasin millions fo' sho'
Uh oh (uh oh), now you bout to have his baby? (dayamn)
Another wild-a*s ni**a that's gon' drive you crazy
You got too much, mo', livin to do - I'm spittin this to you,
cause you deserve more than what he givin to you (that's right)
Beautiful, black, precious, and complicated
A new millennium dime piece, so fine she
got em all stuck standin still when she come through
Baby take a little mo' time, love'll find you
And show us the sky's blue somebody other than me
gon' give you everything you need, feel me?
{Don't cry-ahhhhh..}
[2Pac + H.E.A.T.]
Baby don't cry, you got to keep your head up

[Young Noble]
I'm tryin to do all that I can, from jump
Now you losin, you was choosin the wrong man
Dealt the wrong hand, you was young and beautiful
Lost and turned out, what you let that ni**a do to you? (Damn)
I knew her since elementary, she blew a kiss to me
Wrote me a note in crayon, wantin to get with me
We was kids, now she got three kids
They see their father e'ryday, and they don't know who he is
Seen him last night, homey roll a E-cla*s
Mad cheese in the stash, still a deadbeat dad
I bring her, Pampers and food, just to stop through
but those, ain't my seeds, nuttin really I could do (nah)
I feel pity for you, you ain't even his wife
Seventeen with three kids, locked down for life
Shoulda chose me, she bout to O.D. from the pressure
Hell nah I won't let her {BABY DON'T CRY}
[2Pac + H.E.A.T.]
Baby don't cry, you got to keep your head up

Ballad Of A Dead Soulja 
Yeah.. ballad of a dead soldier
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
This is the ballad of a dead soldier
Come play the ballad of a dead soldier..
[2Pac]
The plan, to take command of the whole family
Though underhanded, to be the man it was planned
All my road dawgs, official mob niggaz love to act up
The first to bomb we rob niggaz
I can be, lost in my own mind
To be the boss only thought's grip on chrome nines
Niggaz get tossed up, war scars, battlefield memories
Swore I saw the devil in my empty glass of Hennesey
Talkin to a nigga on a tight leash
Screamin "Fuck the police," as I ride through the night streets
Lil' child runnin wild, toward his danger
What's the cause don't be alarmed death to all strangers
Maybe I'm a madman
A pistol grabbin nigga unleash the Sandman
Promisin merciless retaliation, nothin is colder
Close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier
[Chorus: singing + 2Pac]
Thug for Life I will be..
(this is the ballad of a dead soldier)
A life of crime I will lead..
(close your eyes, hear the ballad of a dead soldier)
If you play the game, you play to win..
(this is the ballad of a dead soldier)
It's a crazy world full of sin..
(close your eyes)
[2Pac]
Completely lost, revenge at all costs
Payback's a bitch, switch now the trick's crossed
Tossed up and never to be heard of
A single witness screamin bloody murder, murder
Blast tell me homey what you see now?
A blind man and a dead body, I'm read' to leave town
And get my cash though, hook up with Kastro
Homey had to blast on the task force
Stupid coppers tried to play us out, never that
They took my money and my stash, time to get 'em back (heh heh)
Upon my secret arrival
Two glock four-fives, time for survival
Death to my rivals, tell me what you want lord?
Nobody left after the death of a drug lord (eh eh)
The situation's critical
Nothin is colder - than hear the ballad of a dead soldier
[Chorus]
[last line:]
 "close your eyes and hear the ballad of a dead soldier"
[2Pac]
Be a coward, put yo' hands to the moon
When my glocks rang out, the niggaz came out BOOM
Who wanna see me in the challenge?
So merciless I'm terrifyin niggaz in my ballads, do you feel me?
Capo or Capi-tan, one day I'll be the Don
Until then, remain strong
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Bustin at my adversaries like a mental patient
To all my niggaz facin sixty years, sheddin tattooed tears
Another suicidal on the peer
Takin private planes, tryin to survive the game
For all my homies that'll never be alive again
All he promised us is death nigga
Take a breath come be the last one left nigga, it's real now
Villain to fantasize, ain't nothin colder
Listen you can hear it - the ballad of a dead soldier
[Chorus]
[last line:]
 "close your eyes and hear the ballad of a dead soldier"
[2Pac]
This go out to Cato, Mental
All the niggaz that passed away
To Geronimo.. (?).. all the down ass riders
All the niggaz that put it down, all the soldiers
All the niggaz that go through that day to day struggled
This is the ballad of a dead soldier!
All the niggaz that passed on
All the niggaz with ambition and money in they heart
All the niggaz that want some and that don't take none
Hahaha.. it's the ballad of a dead soldier!
The police are so scared of us
All the feds they aware of us
They wanna see us dead
They got pictures of a nigga head, ballad of a dead soldier!
Tryin to see me in chains, shit
Them niggaz'll never breathe again
Before they put me in a cell they'll see me in hell
Cause it's the ballad of a dead soldier!
Got my pistols cocked
Run the whole motherfuckin block, fuck the cops!
The police?  We run these streets nigga
Ain't heard the ballad of a dead soldier!
These niggaz can't see me, half the world wanna be me
Multi-millionaire; shit, it ain't fair
But nigga, you know - it's the ballad of a dead soldier!

Better Dayz 
Lookin for these better days
Better days, heyyy!  Better days
Got me thinkin bout better days
Better days!  Better days, better days
Heyyy!  Better days
Got me thinkin bout better days
[Verse One]
Time to question our lifestyle, look how we live
Smokin weed like it ain't no thang, so even kids
wanna try now, they lie down and get ran through
Nobody watched 'em clockin the evil man do
Faced with the demons, addicted to hearin victims screamin
Guess we was evil since birth, product of cursed semens
Cause even our birthdays is cursed days
A born thug in the first place, the worst ways
I'd love to see the block in peace
With no more dealers and crooked cops, the only way to stop the beast
And only we can change
It's up to us to clean up the streets, it ain't the same
Too many murders, too many funerals and too many tears
Just seen another brother buried plus I knew him for years
Passed by his family, but what could I say?
Keep yo' head up and try to keep the faith
And pray for better days
Better days, better days, heyyy!
Better days.. got me thinkin bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Heyyy!  Better days
Got me thinkin bout better days
[Verse Two]
Thinkin back as an adolescent, who would've guessed
that in my future years, I'd be stressin
Some say the ghetto's sick and corrupted
Plus my P.O. won't let me hang with the brothers I grew up with
Tryin to keep my head up and stay strong
All my homies slangin llello all day long, but they wrong
So I'm solo and so broke
Savin up for some Jordan's, cause they dope
I got a girl and I love her but she broke too, and so am I
I can't take her to the place she wanna go to
So we argue and play fight, all day and night
Makin passionate love 'til the daylight
Plus we about to get evicted, can't pay the rent
Guess it's time to see who really is yo' friend
Tell me you pregnant and I'm amazed
So many blessings while we stressin
Lookin for them better days
For better days, better days, better days, heyyy!
Better days.. got me thinkin bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Heyyy!  Better days.. got me thinkin bout better days
[Verse Three]
Now me and you was real cool, hell on them square fools
Since back in high school, we was true, me and you
Hardly parted or seperated, we stayed faded
Affiliated with gangbangers and still made it
Up in the gym, mess with me, gotta mess with him
Still dressin like grown men when rollin
I went to dark, smokin Newports, gamin marks
Got a place in my heart, homey stay smart
Locked you up in the pen, and gave you three to ten
I send you letters with naked flicks of old friends
Hopin you well, I know it's hell
Doin time in the cells, you need mail, when you in jail
And me I'm doin cool
I settled down, had a family, workin in night school
Every once in a while, I reminisce
And wonder how we ever came to this
I miss the better days
Better days, better days, heyyy!
Better days.. I'm thinkin bout better days
Better days, better days, better days
Heyyy!  Better days.. got me thinkin bout better days
I send this one out, to all the homeboys down in uh, Clinton lockdown
Rikers Island, all them dudes I was uh locked up with, hehe
E Block, F Block, lower H
N-I-C in Rikers Island, downstate
All the peoples I met along the way
Better days is comin homeboy, keep your head up
Better days, better days, better days
Heyyy!  Better days.. uhh, lookin for the better days
Better days, better days, lookin for the better days
Heyyy!  Hahaha..

Black Cotton 
(feat. Eminem, Kastro and Young Noble of the Outlawz)
[Intro: 2Pac]
Black Cotton
Black Cotton
Black Cotton - A symbol for unrewarded struggle
Time for a little gospel tail
Ghetto gospel that is- listen
Robbin' Black Cotton in God's eyes
Speak
[Verse One: 2Pac]
Black Cotton
Steady stressin' Smith and Wessons count my blessin's
Class is in session the worst question is the first question
Why do we work like slaves sweatin' blades to an early grave
Never got paid but still we slave (In the nine tre')
Answer that then answer this too-
Loves gonna get ya you know it's true life's a bitch true
You best to backtrack and try to act black and live
Not to be phony and positive but why be negative?
What's the matter G? Black cat got your tongue
Fat track gotcha sprung now your hung (Do ya feel me?)
Dum dum diddy is it me?
Attempt to reach each and every brother on the streets
If not peace then at least let's get a piece
I'm tired of seeing bodies on the streets- deceased
Lookin' through my highschool yearbook
Reminiscin' of the tears as the years took
One homie, two homie, three homies - POOF
We used to have troops but now there's no more youth to shoot
God come save the misbegotten
Lost ghetto souls of Black Cotton (In God's eyes)
[Chorus: Eminem]
Nobody don't care
(No matter how hard I try/Look to the sky/and I ask God why)
Nobody don't care
(Seems like my dreams/Drowned in by screams/No answer to my questions)
Nobody don't care
(Feels like I'm pressed/Why do I stress?/It's like I'm being tested)
Nobody don't care
(Seems like my prayers/Vanish to thin air/Please answer my questions)
Nobody don't care
[Kastro: Verse 3]
In the belly of the beast I'm bubbling up
Running out of luck, about to self destruct
Old heads say live your life like such
Your sure to catch her witcha one day boy
I wouldn't listen to 'em
Your power movement was cool
But it ain't fix nothin'
So I just go with what i know
I dont trust none
Look what the 80's did
To what's Bebe's kids
And now we grown up
Nobody ain't own us yet
[Young Noble: Verse 4]
Black cotton, I'm plottin' on what they owe me
I'm workin' without a profit
They shacklin' all my homies
I'm hurtin' but keep the mind
And we ain't stop, its cutains, you try to rise and 
Certainly we survive with Outlaw Ridas
What's the reward for a strugala
If the lord lovin' us then why they hate to see us comin' up
Runnin up, Gun cocked like nasty gloves 
If you aint got a penny, mind the glove
No love
Waitin' for my 40 acas and a blunt to blaze
Biblicle times good hearts with milita minds
Black Cotton - I'm hoppin' over enemy lines
Black Cotton - I ain't stoppin' till they givin me mine
Black Cotton

Searching for Black Jesus
Oh yeah, sportin jewels and s**t, yaknahmean?
(Black Jesus; you can be Christian
Baptist, Jehovah Witness)
Straight tatted up, no doubt, no doubt
(Islamic, won't matter to me
I'm a thug; thugs, we praise Black Jesus, all day)
Young Kadafi in this bi**h, set it off ni**a..
What?
[Kadafi]
I do my shootin's on a knob, prayin to God for my squad
Stuck in a nightmare, hopin he might care
Though times is hard, up against all odds, I play my cards 
like I'm jailin, shots hittin up my spot like midnight rains hailin
Got me bailin to stacks more green; Gods ain't tryin to be trapped
on no block slangin no rocks like bean pies
Brainstorm on the beginnin
Wonder how s**t like the Qu'ran and the Bible was written
What is religion?
Gods words all cursed like crack
Shai-tan's way of gettin us back
Or just another one of my Black JesuS traps
[Storm]
Who's got the heart to stand beside me?
I feel my enemies creepin up in silence
Dark prayer, scream violence - demons all around me
Can't even bend my knees just a lost cloud; Black Jesus
give me a reason to survive, in this earthly hell
Cause I swear, they tryin to break my well
I'm on the edge lookin down at this volatile pit
Will it matter if I cease to exist? Black Jesus
[2Pac]
All hail, the pressure no endeavor can fail
Some missin souls turn to hoes when exposed to jail
In times of war we need somebody raw, rally the troops
like a Saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus, hahahahaha
He's like a Saint that we can trust to help to carry us through
Black Jesus
[Young Noble]
Outlawz we got our own race, culture, religion
Rebellin against the system, commence to lynchin
The President ain't even listenin to the pain of the youth
We make music for eternity, forever the truth
Political prisoner, the two choices that they givin us
Ride or die, for life they sentence us
Oh Black Jesus, please watch over my brother Shawn
Soon as the sky get bright, it's just another storm
Brothers gone, now labeled a statistic
Ain't no love for us ghetto kids, they call us nigglets
History repeats itself, nuttin new
In school I knew, e'rything I read wasn't true
Black Jesus
[2Pac]
To this click I'm dedicated, criminal orientated
An Outlaw initiated, blazed and faded
Made for terror, major league ni**az pray together
bi**hes in they grave while my real ni**az play together
We die clutchin gla*ses, filled with liquor bomblastic
Creamated, last wishes ni**a smoke my ashes
High sigh why die wishin, hopin for possibilities
I'll mob on, why they copy me sloppily
Cops patrol projects, hatin the people livin in them
I was born an inmate, waitin to escape the prison
Went to church but don't understand it, they underhanded
God gave me these commandments, the world is scandalous
Blast til they holy high; baptize they evil minds
Wise, no longer blinded, watch me shine trick
Which one of y'all wanna feel the degrees?
bi**hes freeze facin Black Jesus
[2Pac]
All hail, the pressure no endeavor can fail
Some missin souls turn to hoes when exposed to jail
In times of war we need somebody raw, rally the troops

[Kastro]
Some say, some day, some how, some way, we gon' fail
And it ain't hard to tell, we dwell in hell
Trapped, black, scarred and barred
Searching for truth, where it's hard to find God
I play the Pied Piper, and to this Thug Life, I'm a lifer
Proceed, to turn up the speed, just for stripes
My Black Jesus, walk through this valley with me
Where we, so used to hard times and casualties
Indeed, it hurt me deep to have to sleep on the streets
And haven't eaten in weeks, so save a prayer for me
And all the young thugs, raised on drugs and guns
Blazed out and numb, slaves to this slums
This ain't livin... Jesus
[singers repeat in background 3X]
We believed in you
Everything you do
Just wanna let you know, how we feel
Black Jesus!
Searchin for Black Jesus
It's hard, it's hard
We need help out here
So we searchins for Black Jesus
It's like a Saint, that we pray to in the ghetto, to get us through
Somebody that understand our pain
You know maybe not too perfect, you know
Somebody that hurt like we hurt
Somebody that smoke like we smoke
Drink like we drink
That understand where we coming from
That's who we pray to
We need help y'all

Blasphemy 
(feat. Prince Ital)
[music from To Live 
&
 Die in L.A. fades]
[This Week in Bible Prophecy]
God has a plan -- and the bible unfolds that wonderful plan
through the message of prophecy
God sent Jesus into this world to be our saviour
And that Christ is returning, someday soon
to unfold the wonderful plan of eternity, for my life and your life
As long as we're cooperating with God
by accepting Jesus Christ as our personal Lord and saviour
And as the Lord does return in the coming seven days
We'll see you next time here on This Week in Bible Prophecy
[Tupac]
Tupac don't start that blasphemy in here!
Makaveli, the new breed -- and I remember what my pops told me
The new word, follow me -- remember what my pops told me
My family tree, consists of drug dealers, thugs and killers
Strugglin, known to hustle screamin fuck they feelings
I got advice from my father, all he told me was this
Niggaz, get off your ass if you plan to be rich
There's ten rules to the game, but I'll share with you two
Know, niggaz gon' hate you for whatever you do
Now rule one -- get your cash on, M.O.B.
That's Money Over Bitches, cause they breed envy
Now rule two is a hard one, watch for phonies
Keep yo', enemies close nigga, watch yo' homies
It seemed a little unimportant, when he told me I smiled
Picture jewels being handed, to an innocent child
I never knew in my lifetime I'd live by these rules
Initiated as an outlaw, studying rules
Now papa ain't around, so I gotta recall
or come to grips with bein on my enemy's wall (rest in peace)
Promised if I have a seed, I'ma guide him right
Dear Lord don't let me die tonite
I got words for my comrades, listen and learn
Ain't nuttin free, give back what you earn, no doubt
Gettin higher than a motherfucker, blessed and pleased
This Thug Life'll be the death of me, c'mon, yeah
And I remember what my papa told me
Remember what my papa told me, blasphemy
[Chorus: Prince Ital]
Love for dem dat steal in the name of da Lord
Dem a tell nuff lie but holdin my bird in a cloud
Usin de name of de Lord in vein
While de people in de ghetto, feel nuff pain
[Tupac]
We probably in Hell already, our dumb asses not knowin
Everybody kissin ass to go to heaven ain't goin
Put my soul on it, I'm fightin devil niggaz daily
Plus the media be crucifying brothers severly
Tell me I ain't God's son, nigga mom a virgin
We got addicted had to leave the burbs, back in the ghetto
doin wild shit, lookin at the sun don't pay
Criminal mind all the time, wait for Judgment Day
They say Moses split the Red Sea
I split the blunt and rolled the fat one, I'm deadly -- Babylon beware
Comin from the Pharoahe's kids, retaliation
Makin legends off the shit we did, still bullshittin
Niggaz in Jerusalem, waitin for signs
God promised, she's just takin her time, haha
Living by the Nile while the water flows
I'm contemplating plots wondering which door to go
Brothas getting shot, comin back resurrected
It's just that raw shit, nigga check it (that raw shit)
And I remember what my papa told me
Remember what my papa told me, blasphemy
[Chorus]
[Tupac]
The preacher want me buried why?  Cause I know he a liar
Have you ever seen a crackhead, that's eternal fire
Why you got these kids minds, thinkin that they evil
while the preacher bein richer you say honor God's people
Should we cry, when the Pope die, my request
We should cry if they cried when we buried Malcolm X
Mama tell me am I wrong, is God just another cop
waitin to beat my ass if I don't go pop?
Memories of a past time, givin up cash
to the leaders, knowin damn well, it ain't gonna feed us
In my brain how can you explain, time in D.C.
It's hard enough to live now, in these times of greed
They say Jesus is a kind man, well he should understand
times in this crime man, my Thug nation
Do whatchu gotta do but know you gotta change
Try to find a way to make it out the game
I leave this and hope God can see my heart is pure
Is heaven just another door?  I leave this here
I leave this and hope God see my heart is pure
Is heaven just another door?  And my people say
[Chorus 4X]
Our father, who art in heaven
Hallow be thy name
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
In earth, as it is in heaven
Give us this day, our daily bread
As we give up our debts
As we forgive our debt-ors
Lead us not into temptation
but deliver us, unevil
For God, is the kingdom, and the power
and the glory forever, and ever, and ever

All fifty seein visions of me shot in the chest
Couldn't rest, nah nigga I was stressed
Had me creepin 'round corners, homie sleepin in my vest
Shit, I'm like a hostage on this troubled block, call the cops
A thug nigga screamin Westside, bustin double glocks
Hittin corners in my Chevy Surburban
Liquor got me drivin up on the curb, hand on the steerin wheel swervin
Bless me Father I'ma sinner, I'm livin in hell
Just let me live on the streets, cause ain't no peace for me in jail
Gettin world-wide exposure
with a bunch of niggaz that don't give a FUCK, ridin as my soldiers

Westside Outlaw; Bad Boy killer, huh
Complete my mission my competition no longer beefin
I murdered all them bustas now I'm the last motherfucker breathin

Make sure I hold my position, stand firm in the dirt

Stale down here, too many jails down here
Why you act like you don't hear me?
Young Noble, Outlaw 'til these motherfuckers kill me
I'm still breathin
[Napoleon]
Now we was raised, "Fuck this life," I rose my right
Holdin on a tight grip with death in my sight
And the dark is my light, I'm cynical, sleepwalkin as a true
Walk around town with a pound full of, bitter food
Came a long way from my born day, dead away where there's war play
Fuck friends I'll say, rather die for my A-K
with these fag-ass niggaz, see-through glass ass niggaz
Only ride my dick and the skin of my mash-ass niggaz
Breathin!
[Chorus]
[Kastro]
Uhh, I walk around with a knife in my back
Talkin bout a bad day, I live a life like that
It's unfair, and I'm losin my hair, blastin hooligans
Catch me, I'm fallin out flat, yo I'm ruined and
breathin in sewer stench, no one give a fuck about me
I leaned to like it like that, when I was still in mommy
The side of seedy that the devil run from
In the belly of the beast, that's where the fuck we come from
And still I'm breathin!
[E.D.I.]
And still I'm totally wasted, they want me to face this
Just lost two of my closest na'r one of y'all can take this
But I'm Makaveli trained, simple and plain
We number one motherfucker bout to do it again
Shit, 'Pac still doin it, you hoes can't ruin it
Two million everytime he drop I know you fuckers losin it
We movin in - for the kill, for a meal, holdin steel
Hold the wheel I'm bout to give these niggaz somethin they can feel
Fakin real, but we the raw and uncut
Style-bitin thug lyin niggaz, give it up!
We hit 'em up!  (and we still breathin.. and we still breathin..)
[2Pac]
Tell 'em nigga.. tell 'em
(and we still breathin..)
Who'll be the last motherfuckers breathin?
[Chorus - 2X]

Brenda's Got A Baby 
Brenda's got a Baby
Brenda's got a Baby
I hear Brenda's got a baby
But, Brenda's barely got a brain
A damn shame
Tha girl can hardly spell her name
(That's not our problem, that's up ta Brenda's family)
Well let me show ya how it affects tha whole community
Now Brenda never really knew her moms and her dad was a
junky
Went in death to his arms, it's sad
Cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know
Just cause your in tha ghetto doesn't mean ya can't grow
But oh, that's a thought, my own revelation
Do whatever it takes ta resist tha temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now lets watch tha joy end
She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family
Who didn't really care to see, or give a damn if she
Went out and had a church of kids
As long as when tha check came they got first dibs
Now Brendas belly is gettin bigger
But no one seems ta notice any change in her figure
She's 12 years old and she's having a baby
In love with tha molester, whos sexin her crazy
And yet she thinks that he'll be with her forever
And dreams of a world with tha two of them are together,
whatever
He left her and she had tha baby solo, she had it on tha
bathroom floor
And didn't know so, she didn't know, what ta throw away and
what ta keep
She wrapped tha baby up and threw him in tha trash heep
I guess she thought she'd get away
Wouldn't hear tha cries
She didn't realize
How much tha tha little baby had her eyes
Now tha babys in tha trash heep balling
Momma can't help her, but it hurts ta hear her calling
Brenda wants ta run away
Momma say, you makin' me lose pay, tha social workers here
everyday
Now Brenda's gotta make her own way
Can't go to her family, they won't let her stay
No money no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job
She tried ta sell crack, but end up getting robbed
So now what's next, there ain't nothin left ta sell
So she sees sex as a way of leavin hell
It's payin tha rent, so she really can't complain
Prostitute, found slain, and Brenda's her name, she's got a baby
Baaaaaaaaby
(don't you know she's got a baby)
(don't you know she's got a baby)
(don't you know she's got a baby)
(don't you know she's got a baby)
(don't you know she's got a baby)
(don't you know she's got a baby)

More Trouble than tha average
just made 25 and i'm livin' like a savage
bein a G ain't no easy thing
cause you could fuck around get crossed 
and get stuck in tha game
and for tha rest of your life you will sit and remineise
wonder why it had to end like this
and to tha G's you can feel my pain
till tha mothafuckas gets born again
you thought I was a game kid
i'm not tha nigga for playin games
I let my buckshots rang
when I pull tha trigga on my gauge
i'm on tha rampage
makin' runs for tha devil
ain't nothin' on my mind
will get me in some trouble
i'm tryin to ride 
no more loves

Or is a jury starts (break that shit)

stuck outta luck
when I bust
pull me to my death
but i'm a G to tha enemy
[Chorus x2 -- Tupac]
I ain't got time for bitches

I die before they play me
from tha cradle to tha grave

Straight Thug G
kickin' it with tha homies in tha hood
getten' drunk, smokin' blunts
a bitch said I was no good
I gives a fuck
I spend my time in tha dope spot 
never had no time for no bitch 
instead slangin' rocks
and bustin' caps on you punk ass marcs
fake ass G's
bitch niggas with no heart
i'm stayin' real till i'm 6 feet deep
so when a nigga gone
bury me a G
[Chorus x2 -- Tupac]

even when I die

Tangaray got a nigga high

California love!

-California...knows how to party
California...knows how to party
In the citaaay of L.A.
In the citaaay of good ol' Watts
In the citaaay, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin!  We keep it rockin!
[Verse One: Dr. Dre]
Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild west
A state that's untouchable like Elliot Ness
The track hits ya eardrum like a slug to ya chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state with a bomb ass hemp beat
the state where ya never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
lean mean money-makin-machines servin fiends
I been in the game for ten years makin rap tunes
ever since honeys was wearin sassoon
Now it's '95  and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin lookin like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to tha Bay
Your city is tha bomb if your city makin pay
Throw up a finger if ya feel the same way
Dre puttin it down for
Californ-i-a

-Shake it shake it baby
Shake it shake it baby
Shake it shake it mama
Shake it Cali
Shake it shake it baby
Shake it shake it shake it shake it...
[Verse Two: 2Pac]
Out on bail fresh outta jail, California dreamin
Soon as I stepped on the scene, I'm hearin hoochies screamin
Fiendin for money and alcohol
the life of a west side playa where cowards die and its all ball
Only in Cali where we riot not rally to live and die
In L.A. we wearin Chucks not Ballies (that's right)
Dressed in Locs and khaki suits and ride is what we do
Flossin but have caution we collide with other crews
Famous cause we program worldwide
Let'em recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumpin and grindin like a slow jam, it's west side
So you know the row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say
But give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A.
From Oakland to Sacktown
The Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put they mack down
Give me love!

Can U Get Away 
[2Pac]
Whassup?  It's 2Pac.  Can you get away?
Let me come swoop you up.
[girl]
You know I got a man.
[2Pac]
I know you got a man
but he ain't gon' mind if I take you out.
[girl]
Of course he gon' mind.
[2Pac]
Let me take you to lunch.
I'll have you back before he even get home;
before anybody see.
[girl]
I can't.  (Aww c'mon!)  He ain't gon' let me.
[2Pac]
Pleeeeeease...
[girl]
Nah.
[2Pac]
Oh aight.  What's wrong with your eye?
Why you got on glasses?
[Verse One: 2Pac]
Ever since I met ya I could beat depression
It's like your man don't understand, all he does is stress ya
I can see your state of misery from the introduction
Ain't bout no suckin and touchin, just harmless discussion
Maybe we can see a better way, find a brighter day
Late night phone conversations -- would that be OK?
I don't wanna take up all your time, be the next in line
Tell me your size, let me find you things with you in mind
I can see you're cautious and I'm careful not to scare you
But anticipation of love makin 
got you shakin when I'm standin near you
News of precision will prepare ya
In case you get scared, just ask the man in the mirror
Now the picture's getten clearer all he does is hit you hard
I tell you to leave, and you tell me keep my faith in God
I don't understand, I just wanna bring ya home
I wonder should I leave you alone and find a woman of my own
All the homies tell me that you don't deserve it
I contemplate -- but in my heart I know you worth it
Tell me can you get away?
Ebony, can you get away?
C'mon.. let's go.. can you get away?
Can you get away?
[girl]
So much pressure in the air
[2Pac]
I know, I know
[girl]
And I can't get away
[2Pac]
Just for a little while love
[girl]
I'm not happy here
[2Pac]
I know it's hard but, can you get away?
[girl]
So much pressure in the air
[2Pac]
Let's go man, get up outta there
.. can you get away?
[girl]
And I can't get away
[2Pac]
Do you love him?
[girl]
I'm not happy here
[2Pac]
Do you love that man?
[Verse Two: 2Pac]
Could it be my destiny to be lonely?
And checkin for these hoochies that be on me cause they phony
But you was different -- I got no need to be suspicious
Cause I can tell -- my life with you would be delicious
The way you lick your lips and shake your hips got me addicted
I'm sittin here hoping that we can find some way to kick it
Even though I got your digits gotta struggle to resist it
Slowly advance and miss my chance not to miss it
You blow me kisses
when he ain't lookin, now your heart's tooken
My only wish is that you change your mind and he get shook
Wanna take you there but you scared to follow, come see tomorrow
Hoping I can take you through the pain and sorrow
Let you know I care -- that someone's there for your struggle
Depend on me, when you have needs or there's trouble
I wanna give you happiness and maybe even more
I told you before, no time to waste we can hook up at the store
Can you get away?
[girl]
So much pressure in the air
[2Pac]
I know it is
[girl]
And I can't get away
[2Pac]
Yeah you can
[girl]
I'm not happy here
[2Pac]
You ain't happy huh ..can you get away?
[girl]
So much pressure in the air
[2Pac]
I know.. is he beatin on you?
[girl]
And I can't get away
[2Pac]
Did he punch you?
[girl]
I'm not happy here
[2Pac]
Throwin you around the house?
[Verse Three: 2Pac]
I see you remiscin and I hope you listenin
In the position to pressure and offer competition
Me and you -- was meant to be my destiny, no longer lonely
Cause now it's on for you and me, all I can see
A happy home, that's my fantasy
But my reality is problems with your man and me
What can I do?  Don't wanna lose you to the sucker
Cause if he touch ya, I got some drama for that busta
Don't wanna rush ya -- but make your mind up fast
Nobody knows -- on who controls will it last, before I ask
I hope you see that I'm sincere, and even if you
stay with him today I'm still here
I refuse to give up -- cause I believe in what we share
You're livin in prison and what he's givin can't compare
Cause everything I feel for you I wanna let you know
Passion it be yours and I'll never let you go
Tell me can you get away?
[girl]
So much pressure in the air
[2Pac]
Can't get away.. why?
[girl]
And I can't get away
[girl]
I'm not happy here
[2Pac]
Let me take you away
All I really know, can you get away?
[girl]
So much pressure in the air
[2Pac]
Man..
[girl]
And I can't get away
[2Pac]
Course you can get away
[girl]
I'm not happy here
[2Pac]
If you really wanted to get away
you could get away
[Outro: 2Pac]
You ain't got to go through all this drama and this stress
with this old half a man, yaknowhatI'msayin?
I ain't tryin to put you in a position
where you gotta give up your lifestyle for everything
you need but now.. he ain't even takin care of you
He beatin on you and shit; look how you look
She motherfuckin wanna be with that nigga, yaknowhatI'msayin?
Shake that sucker to the left
Let me show you what this life is really about
YaknowhatI'msayin?  You need to be on first class
Need to be goin to Hawaii, seein the world
Seein what this world got to offer you
Not goin to, yaknowhatI'msayin?

Don't cry, it's all good

Impossible my posse dropping you 
We Death Row riders 
No need to beg motherfucker ain't no mercy inside us 
Feeling blessed 
The richer I get the more I stress 
Smoking lye watching time fly, waiting for death 
Dear God I been feeling like I'm close to Jesus 
Paranoid with my pistols close, smoking trees 
Keep my eyes on my foes, those close to me 
Watching niggas catch strays, shake, choke and bleed

A mercenary for the streets 
Check my pedigree 
Busting motherfuckers it's the thug in me 
Now niggas talk a lotta Bad Boy shit 
Then get to squealing

Dog my minds now clear 
And that ain't fair dog 
Your heart pump fear 
In the state I *censored* 
You better hide nigga *censored* is near 
And you know just as well I do 
You ain't no killer 
So kill that 
You wouldn't kill if you had to 
We might wobble but we don't fall down 
We take the gospel from Makaveli 
Pass it around 
Ahhhh, shit 
We gonna taste the power 
We started the thug trend 
The game is ours 
Now we coast together 
Put our thoughts together 
Won't question will we die together 
Cause the hour is soon to come 
Kadafi trained soldier 
I show you how to use your gun 
Bring it

Everybody's a gangsta 
But don't put in work 
Instead of putting on the armor

And the streets ain't got nothing for me but herbs 
I can't trust the church or the mobs 
I can only trust God 
And to tell you the truth I gotta ride 
I only roll with the real 
Cause rolling with the fake got my loved ones killed

By age sixteen I sold to dopefiends
Not yet a drug dealer, but I watched 'em closely
Until they noticed me I got the feds wonderin who broke the law
Far too inhibited for gunsmoke, I broke his jaw
Words harder than a fuckin diamond
Mobile phone call to Simon, niggaz trippin homey, when we ridin?
Fuck them slowly like Jodeci
And stick a needle in my eye if I don't live and die for M.O.B.
And fuck your homeboys nigga we can drop the guns
I hit your block and we can box for fun
Nigga one on one, last to fall is a baller cat
It's Death Row, why the fuck you think we call it that?
So if you knew me in my past life
Don't act like we homeboys, ain't no love in the fast life
I switch gears on them jealous bitches, who do you fear?
The gameplan of a changed man, so what I'm sayin is
[Chorus: Johnta' Austin + (2Pac)]
I changed plans but I'm still the same old rider
(Fuckin with a changed man)
I slang a new dope to the world but the people still buy it
(Nigga you fuckin with a changed man)
All my real thug niggaz, go and get your hands up
You go and drink the Henn' up
(You fuckin with a changed man)
Changed man, you're dealin with a changed man
[Verse Two: T.I.]
In drop top, the glock cocked, got rocks in my socks
Cops spot Watt niggaz but hardly stop niggaz
Not if they got niggaz, doughboys and hot niggaz
Who mighta shot niggaz but only by strugglin
I'm for respect nowadays they expect me
to be in a Ferrari or the old SL
Or anything you see flashin past and can't catch
Dat's me, gauge on the Escalade back seat - don't creep
Oh what you think, T.I., P and them sweet?  (Don't sleep)
Get you hit from your head to your feet  (And you don't know me)
I'm fin' ta introduce you to the old me
You walk in, exploded and leave reload
You don't like a rugged nigga, fuck you, blow me
But you will respect me or get it in your neckpiece G
No three niggaz here are gonna let me be
or get you inside there's codes to the streets nigga
[Chorus]
[Verse Three: 2Pac]
A nigga so cold when I flow, bow down to Death Row
Three wheel motion, comin through coastin
Who's that nigga in the G-ride screamin out
M.O.B.!  Nigga we ride
I hit the charts like a stick-up kid
#1 in the nation
I fucked the world, the Judge gave me probation
Faced with incarceration
Move tapes like it's big weight, slangin to the whole nation
GIMME MINE, or I'm blastin on every song
Murder my enemies, I'm mashin until I'm gone
One love to my thug niggaz
And fuck a bitch, cause a true sister love niggaz
Throw yo' hands in the air, close your eyes and hope
Never come against the massive smoke, on Death Row
My adversaries BLEED
But fuck 'em all 'til the talk cease, fuckin with a changed man
[Chorus]
[Chorus w/ 2Pac speaking over it]
[2Pac]
E'rybody think they understand me
Shit, you niggaz don't know me
Y'all know that nigga on the rap song
Y'all know that nigga in the movies
You don't know this nigga in 3-D
Real live right up against you in front of yo' face
Shit, nigga you fuckin with a changed man
[Outro: 2Pac]
Westside, Outlaw Immortalz, hehehe
You fuckin with a changed man
Hahaha.. you fuckin with a changed man
Hahaha.. I ain't the same, you fuckin with a changed man
We ain't the same, you fuckin with a changed man
We ain't the same, fuckin with a changed man
Changed man

Changes 
[1]
Come on come on
I see no changes wake up in the morning and I ask myself
is life worth living should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' poor 
&
 even worse I'm black
my stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
pull the trigger kill a nigga he's a hero
Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares
one less hungry mouth on the welfare
First ship 'em dope 
&
 let 'em deal the brothers
give 'em guns step back watch 'em kill each other
It's time to fight back that's what Huey said
2 shots in the dark now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother but we can never go nowhere
unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin' changes
learn to see me as a brother instead of 2 distant strangers
and that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me?
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
but things changed, and that's the way it is
[Bridge w/ changing ad libs]
Come on come on
That's just the way it is
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is
aww yeah
[Repeat]
[2]
I see no changes all I see is racist faces
misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under I wonder what it takes to make this
one better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people they'll be acting right
'cause both black and white is smokin' crack tonight
and only time we chill is when we kill each other
it takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven sent
We ain't ready, to see a black President, uhh
It ain't a secret don't conceal the fact
the penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change
try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game
Now tell me what's a mother to do
bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you
You gotta operate the easy way
"I made a G today" But you made it in a sleazy way
sellin' crack to the kid. " I gotta get paid,"
Well hey, well that's the way it is
[Bridge]
[Talking:]
We gotta make a change...
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes.
Let's change the way we eat, let's change the way we live
and let's change the way we treat each other.
You see the old way wasn't working so it's on us to do
what we gotta do, to survive.
[3]
And still I see no changes can't a brother get a little peace
It's war on the streets 
&
 the war in the Middle East
Instead of war on poverty they got a war on drugs
so the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the facts givin' it back to you
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up,
crack you up and pimp smack you up
You gotta learn to hold ya own
they get jealous when they see ya with ya mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this when they try to rush I bust this
That's the sound of my tool you say it ain't cool
my mama didn't raise no fool
And as long as I stay black I gotta stay strapped
&
 I never get to lay back
'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the pay backs
some punk that I roughed up way back
comin' back after all these years
rat-tat-tat-tat-tat that's the way it is uhh
[Bridge 'til fade]

Check Out Time 
(feat. Kurupt, Syke)
[Intro: 2Pac]
Ay what time is it nigga? (I don't know)
Oh shit, 12 o'clock
Oh shit, we got to get the fuck up outta here (hell yeah)
Nigga, it's check out time nigga
Hey call up Kurupt, call Daz room (hey there bitch, where Suge at nigga?)
Call Suge, call all the niggaz tell em to meet me downstairs
(Where K and them niggaz at man?)
Tell the valet, bring the Benz around
(Ay y'all seen my shoes?)
Hey Kurupt, y'all niggaz drivin or y'all flyin back, whassup?
(Kurupt: Man, I'm rollin man, fuck that shit)
Hey Syke nigga, come on man, get up out the bathroom fool
(Fuck that, I lost some money nigga)
Aw nigga, damn
[Verse One: 2Pac]
Now I'm up early in the mornin breath stinkin as I'm yawnin
Just another sunny day in California
I got my mind focused on some papers while I'm into sexy capers
Give a holla to them hoochies last night that tried to rape us
Will these rap lyrics take us, plus room all up in Vegas
I'm a boss playa, death before I let these bitches break us
Last night was like a fantansy, Alize and Hennessee
A hoochie and her homie dirty dancin with my man and me
Told her I was interested, picture all the shit we did
I got her hot and horny, all up on me, what a freaky bitch
First you argued, then I fight it, til you lick me where I like it
Got a nigga all excited, it don't matter just don't bite it
I never got to check out the scence
Too busy trying to dig a hole in your jeans
Now it seems, it's check out time
[Chorus: 2Pac]
We gotta go 
[2X]
Gotta go, gotta go
Yeah baby, hahaha, it's check it out time
We gotta go 
[4X]
Gotta go nigga, gotta go (y'all know what time it is)
Ay, c'mon man get y'all bags man call that valet motherfucker
Tell him to get a nigga shoe, cause we out this motherfucker
[Verse Two: Kurupt]
They label me an outlaw, so it's time for the panty raid
My fantansies came true, with Janet on, I'm in a Escapade
But did it all end too soon
All the homies runnin through the halls room to room, so I assume
Since I'm a playa like my nigga Syke
Then it's only right for me to disappear into the night
My game's Trump tight, so I find time to recline
Sneak into your room, instant Messiah, shit wines of all kinds 
I ain't got that much time
So hurry up and pop the Dom and let me hit it from behind
Since I'm only here for one night, I got to get you hot and heated
Play like Micheal Jackson, and Beat It
One more thing I like to mention, I'm done and I'm out 
cause there's someone else who deserves my atttention
So all the homies round up in the lobby
Cause busting bitches is a hobby, nigga
It's check out time
[Chorus: Kurupt]
We gotta go 
[8X]
Aiyyo man 'Pac ay where the where the fuck is Daz at man?
This nigga locked up or somethin
The only one not to leave
Yo man it's check out time, it's time to get out this mother
You seem them bitches?
We out man, fuck that shit
Yo Rece!  Yo nigga whassup?
[Verse Three: Syke]
Hey I'm livin the life of a boss playa
The front desk callin but I'm checkin out later
My behaviour is crazy, from what you did to me baby
If walls could talk, they'd say, you tried to fade me
I'm puttin in work, but didn't hurt from the jacuzzi to the bed
Carressin your thoughts, cause I'm livin Fed
Heard what I said? Passion is crashin the room 
From the liquor we consumed I heard a boom
I'm blackin out, you're yellin out 'Big Syke Daddy'
We did it in the caddy on the highway, my way
I'm lost in a dream, and so it seemed, to be the night
Five bottles of Cristal and I'm still tight
Out of sight, for 'Pac and Kurupt
As I get it up, once the doors close you stuck
In a heaty, sticky situation
Get up baby, you ain't on vacation
It's check out time
[Chorus: Syke]
We gotta go 
[8X]
Ay, it's check out time
Ay 'Pac, nigga where my motherfuckin, where my shoes go nigga?
Where my motherfuckin drawers and shit at man?
Man y'all niggaz was in here partyin too fuckin much
What the fuck y'all doin nigga?
Kurupt, go tell Daz man and Bogart and the rest of them niggaz
c'mon man, niggaz is trippin man
Front desk all callin me tellin me to get the hell outta here man
We gotta go

Cradle To The Grave 
[Chorus]
From tha Cradle to the Grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.
From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.
June 16, 1971
Mama gave birth 
to a hell raisin' heavanly son.
See the doctor tried to smack me 
but I smacked him back,
My first words were "thug for life" 
and "Papa pass the Mac."
I'm bustin' on these motha fuckas ballin'
Listen you can hear my mini 14 callin'.
From out the window of my drop top
I got my glock cocked 
bustin' at niggas 
when will it stop ?
Now tell me are you scared of the dark?
Can't close my eyes I see visions
And even with this thug livin'
will I escape in prison ?
Penitentiary chances was an all day thang
The only way to advance 
and if you slang
Then you'd better have your nikes on
Cause when we fight 
it's in the middle of the night with no lights on.  
Hey!!
There must be a God cause I feel lucky,
Paranoid out my mind
this motha fucka's tryin' to rush me.
Am I goin' to jail?  
Look at me bailin'
Commin' out the court house 
all about mail and bank
Never die 
be a hustler mothafuckas
And makin' thugs out you suckas.
From the cradle to the grave.
[Chorus]
From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto. easy
From the cardle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.
From the cradle to the grave 
since a little bitty child
I've been known to get ill and kinda buck wild.
Pop pop!  
just like the part that's in my walk with street talk
I'm runnin' up the block in the dark with less spark.
Survalience on a nigga every day,
Waitin' on my daddy just to take his ass away.
Now Mama always workin' tryin' to make ends meet.
So now a young niggas bein' raised by the streets.
And then the on other one that ever showed me love
Was my dope fiend uncle strung out on drugs
a striaght thug.
Just me, my mama out here on our own
So I got two gatts 
one black and one of chrome.
Now I don't wanna hurt nobody but I must defend mine!
It's all the fuck I got 
so stop and walk a thin line.
Young niggas be brave 
and keep on thuggin' from the cradle to the grave,
From the cradle to the grave.
[Chorus]
From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.
From the cradle to the grave, I'm glad to say
I made it this far.
Many G's died hard 
and all they got was their name here up on a wall.
It's sad thinkin' about the times
Life goes on, I'm steady lost in this land...
as the warzone I got no home 
don't have no friends neither.
It's just me by my lonely so I married my nina.
I keeps her wherever I go,
I love my ho.
Never leave home with out my sugar.
I'm hafta plug a nigga.
Mama told me not to trust no punks,
And kick his ass if he lay a hand on me.
Since then I been known.
Sometimes I think my own self stupid
Cause I stay shootin' at marks,
Get twisted up in police reports.
Since the cradle, I've been ungreatful.
My first toy was a gun
I got sprung and learn to love weapons.
But now I'm through with money 
and through with street fame.
Somebody peeled my cap and put me in my grave.
[Chorus]
From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.
From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.
March 18th
a rainy day my mama gave birth
To a baby boy trapped in hell on Earth.
From day one it wasn't fun I never had a crumb.
Daddy worked two jobs and Mama won't stop drinkin' rum.
I tried to cope loc 
but my family's broke
And my pocket's short 
so now I gotta sling dope.
In a game filled with pain it's a fuckin' shame,
The white man got a motha fucka slingin' cane.
So now it's on from dusk to dawn I get my serve on.
Always in the spot with my glock slingin' rocks at the rocks.
Shit don't stop I'm steady dodgin' cops.
I never flip flop 
hear my glock cock 
thug till I drop.
And if I hit the pen I gotta do my time
Sittin' on my bunk reminiscing about the good times.
It's fucked up a nigga gotta grow up doing dirt,
But from the cradle to the grave I'ma put in work.
[Chorus]
From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easy
Living in the ghetto.
From the cradle to the grave, life ain't never been easyy
Living in the ghetto.
Time's movin' fast 
will I last another day?
So I pray and I lay with my A-K.
Did I sell my soul as a young kid?
All the things I did
Wishin' someone held me 
but they never did.
I can't take it 
will I make it to my older age?
Before I'm shot up or locked up in a fuckin' cage.
Lord help me, guide me, save me!
Cause that's the way that Daddy raised me 
crazy.
Do or die.  Nigga pull the trigger don't give a fuck.
You'd rather be in jail than get your ass bucked.
Nobody cares, it's me against the world.
Keepin' murder on my mind and my tech-9.
I got nothin' to lose, payin' dues, nigga you wanna die?
I get high 
then my mission is a walk-by.
You'd better jet when I hit your set cause I'm commin'.
Start runnin' yellin' "evil mind" as I'm gunnin'.
One in the chamber for the anger that I build inside,
For the mothers that cried, for my homies that died.
The begining is an ending, am I just a slave?
So I got to be brave from the cradle to the grave.
[Chorus til fade]

A smokin ass nigga robbed me blind
I got a tech nine now his smokin ass is mine
I guess I felt sorry for the bastard, he was broke
I didn't know he smoked so I didn't watch him close
He caught me on the sneak tip, now the punk's in deep shit 
Catch him on the streets, I'ma bring him to his feet, quick
Pass the clip, I think I see him comin now
Fuck the bullshit, posse deep and let's run him down
Gots to be the first one to hit ya when we meet
Comin quickly up the streets, is the punk ass police
The first one jumped out and said, "Freeze!"
I popped him in his knees and shot him, punk.. please..
Cause cops should mind they business, when we rush
Now you're pleadin like a bitch, cause you don't know how to.. hush..
Now back to the smoker that robbed me
I tell you like Latifah, motherfucker give me.. body..
One to the chest, another to his fuckin dome
Now the shit can rest, yo tell him to leave me the fuck alone
Two very bloody bodies on the streets
A nosey ass cop and a nigga that robbed from me
Run from your backup punk, how you figure?
My finger's on the trigger for you crooked ass niggaz

A nigga's tryin to play me like he know me but he don't
Sittin on ten keys, I'ma get him, think I won't?
My nigga 2Pac, got the fuckin Glock cocked, and he's ready
When the kid, didn't even bring the weight bag, instead he
welcomed us, into his apartment
Oh this even better, two to the head, he's dead a clean get-a-WAY!

So make your move, and act like you wanna flip
I fire thirteen shots, and pop another clip
I bring luck, my Glock's like a fuckin mop
The more I shot, the more motherfuckers dropped
And even cops got shot when they rolled up
Best to bring a knot, or get popped, I'm a soldier
I ain't the type to fetch ya, ask Stretch, he's my witness
Smoke til I'm blitzed, fuck a motherfuckin piss test
I'm trigger happy, try to 'tack me and I'll drop you quick
Long as I got a clip I got some shit to hit em with
The nigga killer I get iller when the shit gets thick
My brain flips, I start thinkin like a lunatic
I rip shit, came equipped with a bigger crew

Dear Mama 
You are appreciated
[Verse One: 2Pac]
When I was young me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time, I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school; and scared to go home, I was a fool
with the big boys, breakin all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister
Over the years we was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddy's, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame mama
I reminice on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary?
Heeey! I see the penitentiary, one day
And runnin from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, mama
You always was a black queen, mama
I finally understand
for a woman it ain't easy tryin to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how ya did it
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated
[Chorus: Reggie Green 
&
 "Sweet Franklin" w/ 2Pac]
Lady... 
Don't cha know we love ya?  Sweet lady
Dear mama
Place no one above ya, sweet lady
You are appreciated
Don't cha know we love ya?
[second and third chorus, "And dear mama" instead of "Dear mama"]
[Verse Two: 2Pac]
Now ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love from my daddy cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry, cause my anger
wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin for a father he was gone
I hung around with the Thugs, and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin
I needed money of my own so I started slangin
I ain't guilty cause, even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin money in your mailbox
I love payin rent when the rent's due
I hope ya got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
Cause when I was low you was there for me
And never left me alone because you cared for me
And I could see you comin home after work late
You're in the kitchen tryin to fix us a hot plate
Ya just workin with the scraps you was given
And mama made miracles every Thanksgivin
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated
[Chorus]
[Verse Three: 2Pac]
Pour out some liquor and I reminsce, cause through the drama
I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act craaazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate, how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if ya hold on
It's a struggle everyday, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Sweet lady
And dear mama

Death Around The Corner 
[Child:]
  Why you by the window?, what's wrong daddy?
[Mother:]
 I know what's wrong with that crazy motherfucker
He's just stand by the goddamn window
with that fuckin' AK all day
You don't work, you don't fuck, you don't,
you don't do a goddamn thing
I see death around the corner, gotta stay high while I survive
In the city where the skinny niggas die
If they bury me, bury me as a G nigga, no need to worry
I expect retaliation in a hurry
I see death around the- corner, anyday
Trying to keep it together, no one lives forever anyway
Strugglin and strivin, my destiny's to die
Keep my finger on the trigger, no mercy in my eyes
In a ball of confusion, I think about my daddy
Madder than a motherfucker, they never shoulda had me
I guess I seen too many murders, the doctors can't help me
Got me stressin' with my pistol in my sheets, it ain't healthy
Am I paranoid? - Tell me the truth
I'm out the window with my AK, ready to shoot
Ran out of endo and my mind can't take the stress,
I'm out of breath
Make me wanna kill my damn self,
but I see death around the corner
[Chorus]
(When we were kids, belonging felt good)
I see death around the corner
(But having respect, that feels even better)
I see death around the corner
(When we were kids, belonging felt good)
I see death around the corner
(But having respect, that feels even better)
I see death around the corner,
the pressure's getting to me
I no longer trust my homies,
them phonies tried to do me
Smoking too much weed,
got me paranoid, stressed
Pack a gat and my vest,
under my clothes when I dress
Here's hopin I die the way I lived,
straight thuggin'
Huggin' my trigger for all them niggas
who was buggin'
My homie told me once,
don't you trust them other suckers
They fought like they your homies
but they phony motherfuckers
And even if I did die young, who cares
All I ever got was mean mugs and cold stares
I got homies in my head
who done passed away screamin, please
Young nigga, make Gs
I can't give up, although I'm hopeless,
I think my mind's gone
All I can do is get my grind on, death around the corner
[Chorus]
I was raised in the city, shitty
Ever since I was an itty bitty kitty
Drinkin' liquor out my momma's titty
And smokin' weed was an everyday thang in my household,
And drinking liquor til' you out cold
And tho' i'm gone now, nigga it's still on- Pow
Bustin on them niggas til they gone
How many more jealous ass bitches, comin for my riches
Now I gotta stay suspicious when I bone
Cause if I ain't sharp and heartless,
them bitches will start shit
Excuse me, but this is where we part bitch
No more game for free, please explain to me
Why niggas trip bitch, who you came to see?
Murderin' now but see me later man, as for my pops
I got homies that will hunt you til you drop
I hope the Lord will forgive me, I was a G
And gettin high was a way of gettin free
I see death around the corner
[Chorus]
This is for all the real mothafuckin niggas out there
I know you ain't scared to die
We all gotta go, ya know ?
A real motherfucker will pick the time he goes
And make sure he handles his motherfuckin business
Y'all niggas stop acting like pussies out there,
all right
[Movie bites]
I'm tired off getting ripped off by guys like that
I want his family dead, I want his house burned to the ground
I want to got there in the middle of the night,
I wanna piss on his head
I want his family dead, I want his house burned to the ground
I want to got there in the middle of the night,
I wanna piss on his head
I want that sonova bitch dead, I want him dead
I want him dead, I don't care

Definition Of A Thug Nigga 
"Nobody's, closing me out of my business"

[2Pac]
 My definition of a thug nigga
"Nobody's, closing me out of my business"
[Verse One: 2Pac]
I played the cards I was given, thank God I'm still livin
Pack my nine til it's time to go to prison
As I'm bailin down the block that I come from, still gotta pack a gun
Case some young motherfuckers wanna play dumb
I guess I live life forever jugglin
But I'll be hustlin til the early mornin cause I'm strugglin
Like drinkin liquor make the money come quicker
Gettin pages from my bitch it's time to dick her
I ain't in love with her, I just wanna be the one to hit her
Drop off and let the next nigga get her
That's the way it goes, it's time to shake a hoe, make the dough
Break a hoe when it's time to make some mo'
I keep my finger on the trigger of my Glock
Ridin down the block lickin shots at the punk-ass *cops*
And spittin game through my mobile phone
The type of shit to get them hoes to bone
My Definition of a Thug Nigga

[Verse Two: 2Pac]
Well I roll with a crew of zoo niggaz
They're quick to pulle a nine when it's time do niggaz
Comin through like I'm two niggaz, a true nigga fuck a Zig Zag
Roll me a blunt and pass that brew nigga
I'm drivin drunk on the freeway, so take it ea-sy
Lookin for a new face to skeeze me
Everybody's lookin for a nut but I'm searchin for the big bucks
Give a fuck, rather die than be stuck
in a one-room shack, and, kickin back
Daydreamin with the nine in my lap (huh)
So how's that from the mind of a Thug Nigga
Bought a fo'-five cause I heard that the slug's bigger
Figure the first motherfucker to jump'll find hisself
gettin swept off his feet by the pump
I put that on my moms, word to the motherfuckin trigger
Before I go broke I'll be a drug dealer, a Thug Nigga
[Chorus]
[Verse Three: 2Pac]
Short than a motherfucker snatched up by one-time
Make a phone call and be back to ball by lunchtime
So here we go, we in the inner city
I keep my hand on my gat and stay cool, my attitude is shitty
Niggaz don't like me cause I'm makin ends
Roll in a Benz and I blaze a blunt, cause I'm all in
And any nigga trying to take what I got'll
hafta deal with the sixteen-shot Glock (huh)
So here we go, I can't be faded
Happy in the motherfucker, finally made it
Got my money in my pocket, finger on the trigger
And I ain't takin shit from no niggaz
I'm just tryin to make some money right
Put some motherfuckin food in my tummy right
I'm feelin good like I'm supposed to, ready to ball
Find a spot and we can serve em all

Don't Get It Twisted 
[Mopreme]
Just 'cause a nigga come in he got style
Don't think I won't flip it
Don't pull your file
But I got enough bullshit to deal with
I'm rollin' with the thugs so
You must be on drugs to the head
Get your ass break down 
Broken half baby
I'm a feelin' like a motherfuckin psychopathic
And if you got beef best leave it in the freezer
I'm no joke
Mopreme straight lo
And you could get smoked
You hook the shit you get stroked 
And all of that
And later be back for your motherfuckin dope sack
Kid it ain't the type of day to play doughnut
Don't get your ass sewn up
Why you leakin on my blown out
Hey, you're mixed up like a bowl of nuts
You fuck around and got it twisted up
Boy, don't get it twisted
[chorus]
Don't get it twisted!.....
[Macadoshis]
It's the Macadoshis coming from the dark side
The park side where the O.G.s do ride
Ain't nothing but killers in the park
As many niggas lost they's heart
When my gat sparks
I'll bust a cap in that ass
Don't get it twisted
When I'm on a mission, niggas come with Mishy
You busters gettin disciplined
And you're comin' up short on your life
When i smoke you with this mac-10  
When it's on it's on 
Fuck it 
I'm makin niggas kick the bucket when I check em' by inducis
Ain't no think to let my shit spin
You on my shit list hope you got a death wish
I tried to warn you but you missed me
You should have listened motherfucker when i said:
Don't get it twisted!
[chorus]
[Rated R]
Niggas got problems about gettin shit twisted 
They need to stay the fuck out of grown folks business
Kids get a kick out of bumpin their big clips
But don't front no shit that brought no shit that peace started 
Cause I'm a cold hearted rider straight dunkin'
never through with my streets
Never hurt nobody but my heat
East side brothers don't hear me though
They'd rather get shit twisted and gather like hoes
Bitch make ass niggas when I caught 'em
Couldn't bust a drape if they wanted
They're soft like Charmin 
But I don't sweat varmits
I suffer with my black group 
Just a one-day murderer
On the motherfuckin Rudy Poop
I snapped his soul, son
Ain't no damn thing funny when I spray your ass with my tongue
And your mommy can't save you now
Cause you got the job twisted up
For fuckin' with a killer

Don't Sleep

[2Pac]
Ahhh shit hahaha
When I enter the first zone
Worst known mic holder
My Hummer roll up
Evacuating strapped soldiers
Inside strategy
Manifestin' military styles
Casually try da g
When niggas battle me
My prophesied prediction
Switch and move positions
Separated from his gun and bitch
And watch 'em start snitchin'
I keep spittin' still stupid niggas fail to listen
I personify this thug livin'
Hell or prison
My ammunition varies
My voice carries
Watch me invite the whole world
Me and the mob gettin' married
It seems all the fine screams pierce the dark
This is expected
A trick bitch where is your heart
You mark
Watch niggas fall when I call they name
We outlaws hold your head niggas all the same
Except some who want more out of life than stress
We still thuggin' 'til its none left
Don't sleep
[Chorus (2x)]
We gon' ride
Keep my pistol on my side
Always creep wit' the nine when I ride (when I ride)
Don't sleep
Blowin' pine
Always hustlin' on the grind
Cause I gotta get mine all the time (all the time)
Don't sleep
[Nutso]
Dumpin' on motherfuckers at random
Rapidly
Wit' accuracy
They shouldn't talk bad to me
It had to be
A motherfuckin' murder
I'm glad to be
A nigga that did the murder
So sad to see
Another motherfucker floatin'
In plastic reef
Sleep wit' his head wide open (head smokin')
Rapid release
Keep the police coastin'
Casualties
Warrant in deep east Oakland (doors wide open)
Yolk the nigga off the asphalt
Drove off to the hills
Positioned him on his knees and blew the back off
Death with the lex ruger
Death to ya
Niggas cry when the bullets fly
Kill and execute 'em
[Yaki Kadafi]
I blast first 'til they body me
Like my guns in variety
Runnin' wit' the real big willies you silly punks try to be
But front
Doin' my walk by's rollin' a blunt
Hand on my nuts in a getaway car full of stunts
Addicted to my nine
Movin' like crime through time
Poppin' niggas like pimples
Nigga nothin' simple 'bout mine
Etch-a-sketchin'
Dumpin' on all you punks at intersections
Day in and day out
Ain't no easy way outs or easy exits
Don't sleep
[Chorus (2x)]
[Lil' Scrappy]
G's up
A-Town
When I hit the street
All I can see is the grind
Blood sweat and tears when I bust my rhyme
Yeah I un- for my folk like I load my nine
And when I let loose
Then no crew standin' but mine
I gives a damn 'bout lame nigga actin' schiesty
Same one knew I was in jail and didn't write me
Wanna fight me then come find me
What eva you do shawty you betta think wisely
You might see me wit' a stack in the trap (Aye)
I use my thoughts and pen
Similar to a saran wrap
A lil' lame nigga I'll neva be
Yeah I'ma keep it g
I'm from the Three and Scrap will neva sleep
Aye

This go out to C. Delores Tucker, Bob Dole
And everybody else who feels like uh
They stronger than the constitution
Freedom of speech big baby
Freedom of speech
Ha ha ha
Outlawz
Goddamn! Rap music I hate that
It's just so violent and it destroys everyone, it makes the kids crazy
The kids kill people
There cop hater
here going against society, I don't understand the music
It's too loud, it's too rowdy, it's too violent
Let's ban all rap music
(Outlawz)
Ban Tupac, ban the Outlaw Immortalz ban 'em
[Verse One: Young Noble]
Listen it ain't no stopping
I gotta hustle
Cop it make it double, try to
Stop it and touch it, I'ma cock it and bust it
Niggaz tryna get it addicted to fast living
Get rich or die trying nigga as 50
I've been Operating Under Thug Laws As A Warrior
Oppressed by the industry the Hip-Hop government ?? by the Hip-Hop Police
Why you think Nas screaming Hip-Hop deceased?
No justice (No justice)
All the judges got grudges
Giving my niggaz life for a little next to nothing
So wherever you are, just a little extra something
You ain't the only one, we all going through the struggle
Penny pinching
It's like you really ain't living
? until eleven's, I'm cooking in the kitchen
Like we looking and we wishing
Praying will he hear it?
It's eating at my spirit
Speaking for the spirits
[Verse Two: Tupac]
You can't break me
Never make me
Busta soft the beats
This Outlaw style got a brother off the streets
Miss Deloris Tucker sue me I won't stop
Till we get justice for these crooked cops on my block
Time Warner full of sissies
Tell 'em all to miss me
A bunch of hypocrites
Whistling Dixie
Good riddance cause you never should of touched me
You cowards knew you couldn't take the pressure I'ma make you sorry
Trust me
Didn't cry when they dropped me
(Nah)
Can they stop me?
Tryna sell 4 million copies
If I wasn't spitting it'd be prison or death
This rap game all we got left
So try to comprehend where we coming from
Life as an Outlaw
Ain't meant for everyone
So here we come
Recognize how we organize
Strategize now we unified brothers on the rise
And we can't stop
[Chorus: Young Noble 
&
 Stormy]
No way no how we got to keep moving
And putting it down
We can't stop
(Outlawz)
Until we reach the top
Through the music we speak to the blocks
Believe it or not
I don't know what you've been, told
Real niggaz don't stay on they go
Can't stop until I get that you know
Won't stop until I get that keep going
[Verse Three: Hussein Fatal]
Bury me with a Makaveli suit and a Mac
I've God strike me with lightning, I'm shooting him back
Skinny cause I don't work out, my man is in the gym
Long as I'm strong enough to put a hammer on your chin
Trapped in the storm
Fuck the world till I'm gone
I'm bucking at Corey Brooke he treating my niggaz wrong
Until I'm gone
They gon' see who I be
I picture this bricks ducking from the penitentiary
[Verse Four: Kadafi]
See
Mysteriously it seems
Through my deepest thoughts and dreams its all wrong
Pop too long gone, and now 18 I'm stranded on my own
Abandoned here in the zone
Protect my thrown pal like a king, Al Capone style
Fake no jacks on this grind
Coked up with crack I get mine
Living life as a Don, Guess Gortex, Louis Vuitton
[Verse Five: Hussein Fatal]
Yeah your boys back with the proper team
When they think I'm wearing Red I'ma rock the Green
On a whole 'nother episode
Cops never heard of ya
The otherside'll hide down the block from the murder scene
Catch ya man he dead with the Fifth
When it's hot on Nu he G-Ride from the clear to the bricks
So gangster how he switched from the clear to the bricks
Niggaz hate it but they scared of the Fifth
(And we won't stop)
Outlawz!
[Chorus]
[Verse Six: Big Syke]
This rap game like a robbery
Cause it seem somebody hiding me
My nigga, made a motherfucker cop a Ki'
Motherfucker ain't no stopping me
My nigga, It's Mussolini see me all in the midst
I'm still chilling like I'm bottle of Crys'
Enemies sharpen they ?
And when they see me they can give me a kiss
So I'm posing with the frozen wrists
Outlaw immortalized we survived and curst
So I claim it like I'm bangin a turf
Yeah it's easy like I'm putting in work
Not been easy you wanna jerk
Come the squeezey I'm ready to murk
Outlawz, Makaveli niggaz ready to flow
So baby are you ready to go?
Outlaw my niggaz be screaming at night
A Big Syko with the thug in your life
[Verse Seven: EDI Amin]
Don't stop (Don't stop)
Keep going (Keep going)
Even when the wheels fall off we keep rolling (Keep rolling)
This Hip-Hop thing just won't stop
It's number one at the top of the charts
Here to stay like 'Pac
Man I just can't let it go
It's in my blood stream (Yeah)
So when I flow, I gotta do my thug thing
For the hood the under privileged and oppressed
Young nigga get rich, cash more cheques
Take the hood life
Put it on on wax
Get stakes now we living the good life
Car brand new and it shine so clean
Bought momma a house, on sweet sixteen's
And we, sitting clean in the latest edition
From the block to the movie screen deep in and pimpin'
Recognize how we organize
Strategize now we unified brothers on the rise
And we won't stop

Don't You Trust Me 
I ain't got time for this man I'm out
[Chorus]
You should stop for awhile you will find me standing by (Don't you trust me?)
Over here at the side of your life (Not that I don't trust you)
You spend all your hours just rushing around
Do you have a little time to have a little time for me?
As soon as I leave the house you wanna page me
See you got me trapped I'm going crazy this is slavery
You act like it's outrageous give me space it won't get better
And maybe we will argue and be through with all these sorry letters
Soon as I come home it's like I get the third degree
Where ya been and who you with I get no room to breathe
It makes me wanna leave
I'm sick of these tricks up your sleeve
Your suspicious I deceive give me grief without belief but to me
If you really trust me then it's pitiful
Question me about my whereabouts that's so trivial
Let me live my life and you can live yours
Just be there to help me and support that's what your here for
Not to give me stress and add to pressure
Home is where I go the rest I go to pass the test
I'm sorry if I left you all alone
But I couldn't make it home so we argue on the phone
Don't you trust me?
[Chorus]
Callin' up my house to hang it up You think that makes sense
Tell me what it takes for us to shake so we can be friends
It's time for us to take our separate paths
We had a lot of laughs but the good things come to pass
Let's think of the evil break don't make it scandalous
Try to be mature I'm pretty sure that we can handle this
You're saying I'm too busy I ignore you
I guess you didn't hear me when I said that I cared for you
But now it seems the arguments are nightly
I wanna hold you tightly but instead you wanna fight me
So why let it stress and aggravate me
Instead I'd rather break hope you don't hate me
You tell me that you love me but your lyin'
Fighting back the urge to start cryin'
I wipe away your tears come and hug me
I love you like you love me
Girl... don't you trust me?
[Chorus]
I hangup the phone (click)
I can't bare to hear you yellin' at me
Maybe we should end it neither one of us are happy
You know that I'm emotional you milk me
Comin' over crying just to get me feelin' guilty
You and me were met to be it yet
You always wanna sweat and how much closer can we get (don't fret)
Just let me pack my things and I'll be outie
This time I'm breaking out you let your mouth overcrowd me
I can't take the beefin' and the griefin'
I get no room to sleep I hope it ceases cause I'm leavin'
Maybe next time you'll be a little more sure
When I can give you more when you unsure
But baby until then I gotta leave ya
It's not that I don't need ya but see ya
And I hope that you understand why I bust it
Not because we rushed it (hell no)
But girl don't you trust me?
[Chorus]
Not that I don't trust you
Don't you trust me?
Not that I don't trust you
Don't you trust me?
Not that I don't trust you

One Nation, young, black and dangerous by far, 
Young nation just trying to get this 
[Verse 1: 2pac]
Murderous mind state, 
Can't keep my nine straight, 
Sippin' on this Hennessy, waiting for the time to break, 
Show up and muthafuckas bow down, recognize 
Westside, Death Row, Outlaw, Ridaz, 
Untouchable mob of pistol packers, 
Well-known felons labeled for 'drug-selling merciless jackers', 
Forever buzz, roll with thugs and dogs, 
Commence the letting off rounds, then escape in the fog, 
Who wants to see me solo? 
Catch Makaveli while he sleeping, 
My mini fourteen murdering niggaz while they creepin, (Uh) 
Duck cause you ass out, 
Drink 'til you pass out, 
Ain't scared to die, drunk driving in my glass house, 
Niggaz is under me, 
They bitches come to me, 
They heard the stories nigga, now they wanna really see, 
Bomb First, my motto, it's fully guaranteed,

[Verse 2: Hussein Fatal]
When it's on, I'm poppin' off every chance I get, 
Out the window on some uptown anthem shit, 
I'm stressin', but ain't no pressure, I been here before, 
Fugitive taskforce at my girlfriends' door, 
Now they checkin' in her bedroom, I ain't there, 
Forty Cals, extended clips, still I ain't scared, 
Outlaw, and best believe they won't take me alive, 
I'm different and I'mma prove it if it take me to die, 
You think God had a plan for me? 
But he won't be layin' up in my casket or doin' life in the can for me, 
Maybe I'm brazen or paranoid than a bitch, 
Me dyin', you think I'd let him see the joy from that shit? 
Walking dead, angels spend their last days by me, 
New Jersey Giant like Dave Tyree, 
Young George or Jonathan Chat, 
Your guns clap, 
Mine will go 'br-r-r-r-att', 
Soldier like Geronimo Pratt, 
And come through cockin' tha black pound, 
When they put the twin towers up, Pac, I'm knockin' 'em back down, 
Poster child, 
Air Force Ones, with the checks, 
I'm supposed to wild sex, 
Money and murder is all I breathe in my life, 
It's full of judges and chasin' enemies in the night, 
Through the Henny, I see the eyes of the Devil, 
He's ridin' with extra boxes of bullets and a nina and a shovel 
[Chorus: Carl Thomas]
Who you are, 
One Nation under a thug and bullet scar, 
Young nation, no revolution and no cause, 
One Nation, young, black and dangerous by far, 
Young nation just trying to get this 
[Verse 3: Papoose]
I always thought I'd have to die to do a record with Pac, 
So I wrote from the perspective of a graveyard box, 
You end up in the box 'cause them grave robbin' bastards, 
Dig your grave up and snatched you out the casket, 
Worms in my eyes, eating through my cabbage, 
The flesh to the bones, 
The bones to the ashes, 
But I'm not dead, 
I'm actually in a session with the Pac Keeper, Sha Money, progressing, 
They don't really want no drama, I know they goons, 
That's why I keep pressure on 'em like a open wound, 
This God given, he keep givin' me better music, 
So every time you hear me, my songs present improvement, 
Y'all can't kill me, y'all forever losin', 
Songs of evolution, 
If I load your gun for you and we bang it out with some other niggas, you better shoot it, 
Don't try to lie and say you was bustin', I'm clever, stupid, 
Claimin' you reppin' Ruthless, 
You got the same bullets you had when I loaded it for you, you never used it, 
The Nasareema dream, get ready for execution, 
Papoose, Fatal and Pac 
The revolution 
[Chorus: Carl Thomas]
Who you are, 
One Nation under a thug and bullet scar, 
Young nation, no revolution and no cause, 
One Nation, young, black and dangerous by far, 
Young nation just trying to get this 
Young nation just trying to get this 
Just trying to get this

Enemies With Me 
(feat. Dramacydal)
[2Pac]
Young Thugs in this motherfucker
Don't break up the fight, let 'em rumble
Don't make enemies with me
I Try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
Don't make enemies with me
Some say my criminal experience is legendary
I do what's necessary
Niggas wanna see me burried
Worried, if you coming hurried
I ain't going down, fuck the world I'm a thug
Tell 'em can't nothing stop me but a slug
I went from drug dealing to a shot caller
From off the block, no longer rock
And putting money in my pocket, nationwide baller
Bitch nigga I'm prepared to die, Before I fry
I hit the weed so I be forever high
My eyes has seen so much in misery, So before I flee
I open fire let the lord pick the first to bleed
Bitches don't wanna see me leave, forever thugging
Tell 'em bury me a G on everything I love
And fuck the law 'cause the raw niggas ain't free
This picture's clear but we can't see, hahaha
This game is jealousy, Don't let 'em change
That's what they keep on telling me, motherfuck the fame
I can't sleep 'cause I keep hearing peeps
? wrapped in my sheets
Don't make enemies with me
I try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
Don't make enemies with me
Rather fuck with these other other little Gs
Don't make enemies with me, nigga
I try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
Don't make enemies with me
Fuck with these other other little Gs
Don't make enemies with me
[Mutah with K-Dogg in ()]
The game is getting deeper with this I couldn't stop, I'm reminising
And having flashbacks when them niggas came up missing
(Wish in my heart, these niggas they ain't have to start
Now therefore they gotta see in dark
Played the part with heart when we spark they part
Running silly through the court) They don't really wanna start
(How you wanna do?) Yo K, anyway
These motherfuckers wanna play we can do it all day
So I stay (Sipping on my aray to keep my head fine
And I'm where? Everywhere from here to bedtime) 
And I squeeze when I say I'm coming
Straight gunning on enemies if it's really me that they wanting
(Cause it ain't nothing, Y'all niggas is fronting
Do you really want it?   niggas dying...)
[2Pac]
Don't make enemies with me
I try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
Don't make enemies with me

Don't make enemies with me
I try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
Don't make enemies with me
You'd rather fuck with these other other little Gs
Don't make enemies with me
[Big Mal with Yak in ()]
Now, we're in '94, Niggas get bust through the do'
Cup? in a flash sittin on that ass (And rarely fold)
Galitter tell 'em bout that trife shit (You wanna fight?
I wanna light shit, you lose your life bitch) bee-yatch!
A nigga struggle too hard for what I got
hustle (And doubled every fucking yard that I cop and stop
Hell nah! I coulnd't see it
Facing a century in the penatentury but so be it)
And Jesus couldn't help me out the state
(Prepare for an early date to see my fate at the pearly gate
But wait) No time for stalling (But death is calling)
You wanna stomp on it somebody's gotta start falling
(True, what I do from sun up) is for a come up
(Wake up with my gun up) Cause when I sneak that's when they run up
(So It's time to spray like Ray
And put the freeze on these fake Gs)  You know how we do
[2Pac]
Don't make enemies with me 
I try to tell these motherfuckers they ain't see
Don't make enemies with me
You'd rather fuck with these other other little Gs
Don't make enemies with me, nigga

Everything They Owe 
Imagine if we could go back
Actually talk to the motherfuckers that persevered (hehehe)
I mean the first motherfuckers that came in the slave ships
(Hey, excuse me, excuse me) Y'know? (Look)
[2Pac]
We back for everything you owe, no longer oppressed
cause now we overthrow those that placed us in this rotten mess
But let's agree on strategy and pick out enemies right
Who stands accused of the abuse my own, kind do right
Pardon, not disregardin what you thinkin but you musta been the ship 
cause once I rip your whole shit is sinkin
Supreme ideology, you claim to hold
Claimin that we all drug dealers with empty souls
That used to tempt me to roll, commit to violence
In the midst of an act of war, witnesses left silent
Shatter, black talon style, thoughts I throw
It remains in your brain then of course it grows
Maybe, even your babies can produce and rise
Picture a life where black babies can survive past five
But we must have hope, quotin the reverand from the pulpit
Refuse to turn the other cheek we must defeat the evil culprit
Lace me with words of destruction and I'll explode
but supply me with the will to survive, and watch the world grow
This ain't bout talkin bout problems, I bring solutions
Where's the restitution, stipulated through the constitution
You violated, now I'm back to haunt your nights
Listen to the screams, of the lives you sacrificed
And in case you don't know, ghetto born black seeds still grow
We comin back, for everything you owe
[Chorus: sung]
I'm comin collectin the shit that belong to me
Motherfuckers are runnin and duckin
I'm a crazy nigga on a mission wit a bad mentality
Armed with missiles guns grenades
Pull out the pin, free I'm comin
[2Pac over Chorus]
How do you plead Mr. Shakur, how do you plead?
How do I plead?
Yes sir, how do you plead?
Shit, you know how I plead
C'mon!!
Psssh
[2Pac]
Not guilty on the grounds of insanity it was them or me
Bustin at my innocent family, say they lookin for ki's
I was home alone, blind to the prelude
Bust in, talkin bout, "Where is the quaaludes?" What you say fool?
Where in the hell is the search warrant?
No feedback is what he uttered, before he screamed "Nigga motherfucker"
Dropped me to my knees I proceed to bleed
Sufferin a rain of blows to my hands and knees
Will I survive, is God watchin?
I grab his gat and bust in self-defense, my only option, God damn
Now they got me goin to the county jail
And my family can't pay this outrageous bail
Try to offer me a deal, they told me if I squeal
move me, and my people, to a mansion in Brazil
Not me, so this is how it ends, no friends
I'll be stressed and they just, reposessed my Benz
Told the judge it was self-defense, he won't listen
So I'm bumpin this in federal prison, givin everything I owe
[Chorus - 2X]

Ladies and gentlemen! (And gentlemen)
This, is a Jazze Phizzile produc-shizzle (Jazze Pha, Jazze Pha)
My nizzle! (My nizzle) Ha!
Outlawz! (Outlawz) 2Pac, Makaveli!
Still breathin, yeah, woo - wooo-WHEEE!
[Verse One: 2Pac]
A picture of perfection, the object of a nigga affection
Partners in passionate sex, a place to put my erection
Fantasies of you in submission, freaky positions
Pushin permanent twistin I'm on a mission got me on the mash
Tried to dig, you was screamin when I did
Steady yellin out spots for me to hit, and aww shit
Soon as I seen her saw us playin hide the weiner
Wanna "Freak Like Me," fuck Adina
Up and down is the object, side to side
Make you holla out my name when a thug nigga ride, can I come inside
Say you don't feel it that's a lie, you just scared to get this
penitentiary dick, the trot caught your eye
when I walked by, I said, "Hi"
But you was so shy, I can't lie, damn near stuttered when you walked by
You want me to lick it and even worse
Got your heart set on me goin first, and that ain't no fair exchange
[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
You do me
And if it's worth it baby I'll return the favor
And give it back to you
A fair exchange, on everythang
Let me tell you that's the way it's gotta be
Open your eyes baby, recognize a player
Give it up to me (give it to me give it to me)
A fair exchange, you know the game
We can do the damn thang, thang, thang
[Verse Two: 2Pac]
Open your legs
Got me watchin like it's a million, you tremble from the feelin
Look up, cause I got mirrors on the ceiling
And if you willin, then we can ride until the sun shine
And just for fun, I betchu I can make you cum sixty-one times
Close your eyes, let me heat it up
Cause when we fuck I refuse to bust a nut until I beat it up
Drop the top, time to fuck while the wind blow
Baby throw yo' legs out the window
Remember on the balcony, bend over baby bounce on me
And let me hit it where it counts and flee
Remember me?  "I Get Around," and I'm haunted by my temptations
Sexual participation, my motivation
Even though I like the way you work it
You don't deserve it cause you walk around actin like you perfect
Took a while but I finally got it, and like a boss player
Bitch you ain't doin me no favors, fair exchange
[Chorus]
[Verse Three: 2Pac]
Now yo' attitude ain't realistic
Yeah it's true I'm gettin pussy, but baby you gettin dick!
And since you bein laced with the penetration
It's only right to show a form of appreciation
Instead of fakin like you can't hear the bed shakin
In bed naked you so twisted think yo' legs breakin
You said take it so I'm blind in my passion, how long will I last?
Doggie style steady pumpin on that ass, until I blast
And then I laugh as we lay back
See I wait 'til you asleep and that's the payback
Cause you actin like you did somethin, givin me a piece
I had you mufflin your screams in the sheets, fuckin with me
A true digger that love triggers, a thug nigga
Hustlin bitches like drug dealers
Before I say goodbye, put an end to all the games
Here's my number for another fair exchange
[Chorus - repeat 2X]

So don't give up your conversation, give that bitch your 7 digits
When she call ya, ask that tramp whassup
And if she hesitate, nigga hang up, worrrd up
And let that bitch meditate to the dial tone
And call me when you're ready to bone, and it's on
A motherfucking mack tonight

You fuckin punks, I hate you snitches
Went against the grain and the game to be fake ass bitches
(God, damn! You can't just hit them niggaz with that game
and expect them to accept it; girl your heard me it gets skanless.
But we gonna kick this shit like this here)
[Chorus: 2Pac]

Lyin ass niggaz and you punk ass snitches

Broke hoes runnin round yellin "Gimme!"

Shit all I wanted her to do is suck my DICK
So how about hittin a motherfucker on my pager
Busy now bitch but you can give me the pussy later

Fame 
And my niggas say 
We want the FAME 
C'mon c'mon 
[Chorus]
One thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
Nothing but pain 
Stuck in this game 
Searching for fortune and fame 
The one thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
It's been nothing but pain 
Stuck in this game 
Searching for fortune and fame 
[Verse 1: Tupac]
Though we exist and breathe 
Some believe currency comes to g's 
Stresses half the ghetto 
With success comes greed 
[echo]
They got me hot 
When they shot me 
Plotted 
My revenge 
To increase my ends 
Enemies gettin dropped 
Win or lose 
Red or blue 
We must all stay true 
Play the game nigga 
Never let the game play you 
And for the fame 
[echo]
Niggas change fast 
[echo]
That's a shame 
[echo]
What's the game 
Lost souls 
Who controls our brain? 
Who can I blame? 
[echo]
The world seems strange at times 
Somewhat insane 
[echo]
I'm hoping we can change with time 
I'm living blinded 
[echo]
Searching for a ?? curse 
I know death follows me 
But I murder him first 
And worse yet 
With each breathe 
Steps I take 
Breathless 
Is there a cure for a hustler with a death wish? 
Cigar ashes 
Coaster 
Crystal glasses 
We mash on them jealous bastards 
With a ski mask 
I'm the first one to warn them 
Blast it 
Wrapped in plastic 
Bullshitting got his ass hit (outlaws) 
Ain't nothing left now 
Treated like a stepchild 
Was not for me 
Nothing but busters and bitches (fuck em all) 
Be rocking beats 
Fake in fame 
[Verse 2:]
Block run and shoot slugs 
We throw them back like hardballs 
Without the gloves 
No love for these fake desperados 
And thugs I bleed to envy 
Smoke and blow out they blunts 
Sipping Henney 
Drunk nights 
And hot days 
Cocking my heat 
Shooting it sideways 
A wife on the run 
Full of common blunts 
Unconditionally married 
To my gun 
Fulfillin' my destiny 
On knees 
And ones desires 
Be pulling all my cabbage 
Like priors 
Stuck in the trance 
Searching for something higher 
Fortune and fame 
[Chorus]
One thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
Nothing but pain 
Stuck in this game 
Searching for fortune and fame (FAME) 
The one thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
It's been nothing but pain 
Stuck in this game 
Searching for fortune and fame 
[Verse 3:]
Searching for fortune and fame 
Lost in the rain 
A lose of the game 
With life the cost of the game 
We forcing the change 
Mother fuck flossing the chain 
[echo]
All the blame 
Belongs to the part of the brain 
[echo]
That we never use nigga 
Plus my heart is in pain 
[echo]
And if I ever lose homey 
Bet I'm at it again 
[echo]
Outlaws don't die 
So united we stand 
[echo]
And if family 'come a foe 
All the fortune and fame 
[echo]
[Verse 4: Napoleon]
As I walk up in the crib 
Laid to rest me head 
Say some rhymes to angels 
Hope they bless my bed 
Hope they bless me the righteous way 
Got a homie locked down 
Outta town 
I sent him a kite today 
Man that hate in your heart 
Your gotta cleanse it dog 
Praying for my downfall 
And I can sense it dog 
I was passed down the street fame 
Like glocks clocked 
And keep aim 
Was raised up with a clock box 
And I ran with the local street gang 
They say the light is faded 
But still shine in the dark 
You can easy been a man 
But you is a boy in your heart 
And that's some game that I got 
From generation of game 
In the road of life dog 
We need to switch up lanes 
Think about it 
[Chorus]
One thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
Nothing but pain 
Stuck in this game 
Searching for fortune and fame (FAME) 
The one thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
It's been nothing but pain 
Stuck in this game 
Searching for fortune and fame 
[Verse 5:]
I can't complain 
I've seen my fair share of the fame 
It wont change me 
Now I've got this piece of change 
I feel strange 
I got so use to the hood 
That when I finally got out 
At first it ain't feel good 
I was just a baby 
Still retarded from slavery 
When we struggle to shovel shit 
Ain't nobody saved me 
Ghetto ain't made me 
I made myself 
Poverty raised me 
Thinking ain't no help 
I pray for my health 
My mind 
And my family too 
State of myself 
My grind 
And my family crew 
Where one hand watches the other 
No we ain't blood 
But we still real brothers 
The struggle is real 
Nothing can steal 
What we build 
And that remains the same 
'Till that day we killed 
And that's real 
Life that I was aimed to be 
Love by my family tree 
That's fame to me 
How about it 
[Chorus]
One thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
Nothing but pain 
Stuck in this game 
Searching for fortune and fame 
The one thing we all adore 
Something worth dying for 
Nothing but pain 
Stuck in this game 
Searching for fortune and fame

Remember me I'm ya homie that was down to brawl
Sippin' Hennessy hanging with the clowns and

You can throw ya middle finger if ya feel me loc

It took time but finally the cash was mine
all the rewards of a hustler stuck in the grind
Look around and all I see is snakes and faces

and when you stuck where the fuck is all ya friends
They straight busted and can't be trusted fuck y'all
[Chorus]
Fuck all y'all

[Verse 2]
I'm sippin' Tanqueray and juice and what's the use

Ain't no love reminiscing on how close we was
way back in the day before they put the crack in the way
and heeyyy how much money can you stack in a day
It's gettin' rough collect calls from my niggas in court
I recollect we used to ball now just living's enough
I stand tall in the winter summer spring or fall
Thug for life scrawled all across the wall
and all about my dollars make me wanna holla
drop an album sell a million give a fuck about tomorrow
I know it's gettin' crazy after dark
these marks keep on huffin' and puffin'
ain't no fear in my heart
What's going on in the ghetto still struggle and strive
I still roll with the heater smokin' chocolate thai
In 94 I'll be going solo
too many problems with my own
so I'm rolling do-do
Fuck all y'all
[Chorus 3x]
[Verse 3]
I went from rags to riches quick
to socializing with the baddest bitches

mixed with some indonesia watch me fly
And even though I know the cops behind me

Fuck the law give a shit I'm even worse than before
I know they wanna see a nigga buried
but I ain't worried still throwing these thangs
got me locked in these chains
and hey nigga what the fuck is you wailin' 'bout
soon as I hit the cell I'll be bailin' out
And when I hit the streets I'm in a rush to ball

Jump up and get your ass shot up 
For the profit pick my glock up

Poppin' nobody got em' 
Holla Outlaw riders 
Mash up on the gas pedal 
Vacate the scene 
Count the cash and stash the precious metal 
Here come the coppers

Why? Cause they'll never stop us 
I watch Arnold Swarchzenegger

Screamin'

Everybody just throw your hands in the air) 
Let's be friends..
(Wessyde in this motherfucker right here, Wessyde..)
[2Pac]
Approach you and post a minute, arm on my double-R tinted
As you pass bye wink in my eye, freshly scented
What's the haps baby? (Whassup?) Come get with me and perhaps lady
you can help me multiply my stacks baby
Currency seems small I need companionship (hey)
Through with that - scandalous shit, I bet your man ain't shit
So why you hesitatin actin like yo' shit don't stink
Check out my - diamonds bitch everyone gonna blink (bling bling bling)
This be a thug thang, Outlaw nigga with riches
Cream dreamin motherfucker, on a mash for bitches
Check my resume, sippin on Cristal and Alize
Smokin on big weed, keyed the Cali way
Don't like trickin but I'll buy you a fifth
I can't stand no sneaker-wearin nappy head bitch
Let my pedigree, re-breed me, they're so cheap
Puttin bitch-made bustas to sleep with no grief
Mash on my so-called comp, who the man?
While I'm tuggin on yo' main bitch head (C'mere baby, Wessyde!)
Understand this, ain't no nigga like me, fuck Jay-Z
He broke and I smoke daily (come on y'all) baby let's be friends
[Chorus: singer + 2Pac]
Let's be friends (where my niggaz at? come on)
You ain't gotta be my man at all, long as you just bring me your
friends.. (all my niggaz, where my hoes at?)
Why you trickin on them other hoes?
Let's be friends (where the bitches at, where the niggaz with money?)
(where you at baby?)
You ain't gotta be my man at all, long as you just bring me your
friends.. (cash makin hoes)
Why you trickin on them other hoes?
Let's be friends
[2pac]
I met you and I stuttered in passion
Though slightly blinded by that ass
It was hard to keep my dick in my pants
Every time you pass got me checkin for you hardcore; starin and watchin
Me and you one on one (see that bitch) picture countless options
Was it prophecy?  Clear as day, visions on top of me
Erotic, psychotic, we posess bubonics
Far from a crush I wanna bust your guts and touch
everything inside you from my head to my nuts
You got me sweatin like a fat girl goin for mine
Just a skinny nigga fuckin like she stole my mind
Back in time I recall how she used to be
I guess money and fame made you used to me
What's up in 9-6?  Fine tricks in drag
Fuck Dre, tell that bitch he can kiss my ass
Back to you, my pretty ass caramel queen
Got my hands on your thighs now
Let me in between as friends
[Chorus: singer + 2Pac]
Let's be friends (wessyde, motherfucker right here)
You ain't gotta be my man at all, long as you just bring me your
friends.. (wessyde in this motherfucker)
Why you trickin on them other hoes?
Let's be friends (wessyde in this motherfucker right here)
You ain't gotta be my man at all, long as you just bring me your

Why you trickin on them other hoes?
Let's be friends
[2Pac]
Can you imagine me in player mode, rush the tricks
I got em ready for a booty call, I fucked your bitch (Ha hah!)
Was it me or the fame?  My dick or the game?
Bet I scream WESSYDE when I came (wessyde, ha ha ha)
Scream my name, cause baby it's delicious got a weak spot
for pretty bitches up and down, similar to switches
My movement, baby let your back get into it
Make it fluid, in and out, all around when a nigga do it
You got me high!  Let me come inside!
I love it when you get on top, baby let me ride! (let me ride!)
Who wanna stop me?  Am I top notch?
Fuck player hatin niggaz cause they cock block (cock block)
You probably hate to see a real thug with vision, what's the game?
Rather see a nigga up in prison, why you change?
Made a livin out of cuss words, liquor, and weed
A bad seed turned good - in this world of G's
Baby got me fantasizin, seein you naked
It's the fuck song, so check my record
And let's be friends
(Where my niggaz at?  Show me where my niggaz at?
 Where my bitches at)  Thug style!
[Chorus: singer + 2Pac]
Let's be friends (where my niggaz at, where my bitches at?)
(Throw yo' guns in the air!)

Fuckin Wit The Wrong Nigga 
Niggaz.. fuckin wit the wrong nigga..
[2Pac]
My seductive introduction be specific, still elusive
but exclusive's what I give you when I kick it, and I'm still lifted
Niggaz can't get with Mr. Wicked
Picture me flippin my adversaries, gettin the dick swiftly
Niggaz are swingin wild, but they styles miss me
You can bring that bitch but ya whole click'll still get treated shitty
Business never personal I'm up before the sun come up on thai
Just a ghetto star, a dropped up double-R is what I'm ridin
Nigga, if you was half the man yo' bitch was, bring you artillery
when you come for me, cause we sick thugs
No hesitation when I pull and blast, cause Syke was bustin
plus, Bow had 'em duckin, screamin, "Get they cash!"
So now I got the law on me, my phone's tapped
So I had to send word through my lil' homies
Tell them niggaz this the year when they pull the trigger
Shit, this is what you get, for fuckin, wit the wrong nigga..
This is what you get, when you fuckin wit the wrong nigga..
Hehehehe, yeah nigga, peep it
Before I lay me down to sleep I, pray and thank the Lord
for givin me another fruitful, dayyy
I wanna be a peaceful man but still when niggaz come for me
all I can see is gettin 'em, killed
For real it's how I feel, reflect my thoughts, flowin on these reels
Make my enemies deal with my steel, they caps peeled
We still cool but you played yourself
Give him the mac and make him spray hisself, heyyy
Fallin legends clutchin chrome three-five-seven
Puttin two bullets to they dome, wanted to die in heaven
Why call in shots nobody really as clear as me
Ain't tryin to help the feds get a case for conspiracy
Murder my foes get disposed of
We all homies to the death, so my true niggaz show me love
God forgive me for my lifestyle, a negative figure
But why they fuckin wit the wrong nigga, y'know?
It's like..
Why you fuckin wit the wrong nigga..
I was raised by thugs, schooled by killers
Learned my mathematic skills from real drug dealers
Tried to rise but they tried me
I guess they all had to die cause we tried peace
I die in these streets, blast 'til they recognize
Still do or die, all my niggaz gettin high watchin time fly
Best strategize on the way to profit
Best organize how you ride so they can't stop it
Then keep it poppin lot of busters wanna see me fall
I fucked yo' bitch and now this new shit gon' fade 'em all
My niggaz ball made a call for some backup
for lil' homies and my dogs in the black truck
Buck buck was the sound as they gats burst
No need for ambulance, baby bring the black hearse
Shoulda never fucked around busta, how you figure?
Makin moves on the wrong nigga, is what it sounds like
Ding ding ding.. when you fuck wit the wrong nigga..
Niggaz gettin hit, when they fuck, wit the wrong nigga..
Fuckin wit the wrong nigga..

Fuck The World 
(feat. Digital Underground)
[Shock G sings the parts in {} throughout]
[2Pac]
Haha, what you say?
Who you callin rapist?  Ain't that a bitch
You devils, are so two faceted
Wanna see me locked in chains, dropped in shame
and gettin stalked by these crooked cops a-gain
Fuckin with the young black male, tryin to stack mail
and umm, stay away from the packed jails
I told the judge I'm in danger
and that's why I had that fo'-five with one in the chamber
Fuck the world!
[Chorus: 2Pac]
{They tryin to say that I don't care}
I woke up screamin, "Fuck the world!"
{They tryin to say that I don't care}
Just woke up and screamed, "Fuck the world!"
{They tryin to say that I don't care}
Uhh, I woke up and screamed, "Fuck the world!"
{They're tryin to say that I don't care}
Just got up and screamed, "Fuck the world!"
[2Pac]
When I was comin up rough that wasn't even what you called it
That's why I smoke blunts now and run with alcoholics
I'm gettin, threats to me, comin from my enemies
And, in they dreams it's, Hell where they sendin me
Have I, lost control or just another soul
A car full of motherfuckers when we roll
Sippin on yak as I sit back (YES!) life as a big mack
Brothers come up and say, "You did that?" {uhh, uhh, uhh}
Never take yo' eyes off the prize, and even if you gettin high
don't ever hesitate to try
Cause you can fall off or stay ballin, niggaz we all in
And them my motherfuckers callin {ohh, ohh, ohh}
Fuck the world!
[Chorus: 2Pac]
{They tryin to say that I don't care}
I woke up and screamed, "Fuck the world!"

Man, fuck the world..
Damn, they wanna label me a menace
cause I'm sittin here sippin on Guinness
Weighin 165, and these tricks should die
for bein jealous of a brother when he rides
I can see it in yo' eyes, you wanna see a young playa fallin
They hate to see a nigga ballin
Some of you suckers is rottin, plottin on what I got
And then you wonder why I shot him (boo-ya!)
Stop givin game for free, you wanna hang with me
like being a thug is the thang to be?
But I got love for my homies, the G's and macks
And if you're black, you better stay strapped
Nigga, fuck the world!
[Chorus: 2Pac]
{They tryin to say that I don't care}
I woke up and screamed, "Fuck the world!"
{They try to say that I don't care}
I woke up and screamed, "Fuck the world!"
{They tryin to say that I don't care}
Got up and screamed, "Fuck the world!"
Haha, fuck the world!  Fuck it
I hear my niggaz screamin fuck the world!
[2Pac]
They wanna know if I claim the click, that I'm hangin with
and if I'm down with this bangin shit
Well homie I don't give a fuck if you Blood or Cuz
Long as ya got love for thugs
But don't try to test me out, stall that
Homie this is Thug Life nigga and we all strapped
I been through, Hell and back, and if I, fell black
then it's, back to the corner where we sell crack
Some of you niggaz is bustas; you runnin 'round 
with these tramp=ass bitches, don't trust her
But don't cry, this world ain't prepared for us
A straight thug motherfucker who ain't scared to bust
Fuck the world!

Ghetto Gospel 
(feat. Elton John)
Uhh,
Hit them with a lil' ghetto gospel
[Chorus - Elton John:]
Those who wish to follow me (My ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior without the sound of guns
[2Pac]
If I could recollect before my hood days
I'd sit and reminisce, nigga and bliss on the good days
I stop and stare at the younger, my heart goes to'em
They tested, it was stressed that they under
In our days, things changed
Everyone's ashamed to the youth cause the truth looks strange
And for me it's reversed, we left them a world that's cursed, and it hurts
cause any day they'll push the button
and yall condemned like Malcolm x and Bobby Hunton, died for nothing
Don't them let me get teary, the world looks dreary
but when you wipe your eyes, see it clearly
there's no need for you to fear me
if you take your time to hear me, maybe you can learn to cheer me
it ain't about black or white, cause we're human
I hope we see the light before its ruined
my ghetto gospel
[Chorus - Elton John]
[2Pac]
Tell me do you see that old lady ain't it sad
Living out a bag, but she's glad for the little things she has
And over there there's a lady, crack got her crazy
Guess she's given birth to a baby
I don't trip and let it fade me, from outta the frying pan
We jump into another form of slavery
Even now I get discouraged
Wonder if they take it all back while I still keep the courage
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottles
I make mistakes, I learn from everyone
And when its said and done
I bet this Brotha be a better one
If I'm upset, you don't stress
Never forget, that God hasn't finished with me yet
I feel his hand on my brain
When I write rhymes, I go blind, and let the lord do his thang
But am I less holy
Cause I choose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace and end the war on the streets
My ghetto gospel
[Chorus - Elton John]

Lord can you hear me speak!!
To pay the price of being hell bound...

Ghetto Star 
For all my low life thug niggas, 
For all my niggas in the hood, 
Livin the life of a ghetto star, 
Ha ha ha Makavelli, 
Just holla my name 
And witness game official 
Niggas is so shame 
They stare stiff like scared bitches 
While I remain inside a paradox 
Gone my block 
Though gun shots is promised to me when will I stop 
I hit the weed 
And hope to god I can fly high 
Witness my enemies 
Die when I ride by 
Ita's shit to try 
Send they bodies to they parents up north 
With they faces they wrists and they nuts cut off 
Fuck em all what I scream as I dream

Ghost

The only way, for me to come back, is by Makaveli
That's it!  All these motherfuckers stole from me
I'm takin back what's mine
[slowed down voice]
[laughing]
 You motherfuckers can't stop me
Even if I die, I'm gon' be a fuckin problem
Do you believe in ghosts, motherfucker?
Real live black... ghosts
Feel me?
[Verse One: 2Pac]
Some say I'm crazy, these punk-ass cops can't fade me
Mama tried to raise me, but had too many babies
Papa was a motherfuckin, joke
Used to find dope in his coat
And nearly choked when he'd tell me not to smoke
Daaamn, don't get me started
My mama smoked so God damn much
when she was pregnant I'm surprised I ain't retarded
At night I can't sleep, count sheep
As they pass through the glass of my neighbors five deep
Starin at the wall, heard a scream
Wake up in the mornin
See the blood in the hall from the murder scene
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullabye
On the corner, where the niggaz slang they crack
And the undercovers jack those that don't watch they back
(Five-OH!) I daydream about the dope world
Take a puff from the blunt and watch the smoke swirl
My mausberg goes BOOM, what's another plug
Snatchin drugs, pumpin slugs in these other thugs
(GIVE IT UP NIGGA) Don't run out of breath
Every step could be death 'til you blast
And be the last nigga left, then I'll be ghost
[Chorus: 2Pac]
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullabye
Don't cry, just ask why, and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullabye
[Verse Two: 2Pac]
A seven-deuce full of niggaz goes by
Thought I was trippin the second time they rolled, by
Recognized the plates, the faces looked familiar
Everybody swear they know the nigga that's gonna, kill ya
Don't murder me murder me, killa a nigga in his sleep
Let me die as I rest in peace, deep
Back to these niggaz in the seven-deuce
A mac-10 out the window bout to let it loose, what could I do?
Run for cover and return fire
DIE MOTHERFUCKIN DIE, hope yo' ass fry, don't ask why
But I let off everything I have
An empty clip, hit the ground as a nigga dash
On my ass was the motherfuckin cops now
Barely breathin tryin to keep from gettin shot down
BOO-YAOW is the sound, bullet whizzed by
Still runnin like a nigga got nine lives
Don't know why but I'm runnin to my fuckin block
Took a shot, tired of runnin from the niggaz and the cops
Time to be a ghost
(HEY MAN, COME THE FUCK ON!)
And then we'll be ghost

Rest in peace to my mothafucka Biggie Smalls
That's right boy, it's goin on
Right here, Thug Life
God bless the dead
God bless the dead

 buried nigga
Don't worry if you see God first tell Him shit got worse
I ain't mad, I know you're representin the crew
And I can picture you in Heaven with a blunt 
&
 a brew
Fuck the world, pain was a part of the game
If you a baller, money went as quick as it came
My role models gone or they locked in the pen
Straight hustlas, caught up in the whirlwind
The other day, I thought I seen my homeboy Biggie
Sayin shit don't stop, nigga, no pity
We all hoods, and all we ever had was dreams
Money makin mothafuckas plot scandalous schemes
In the gutter, you learn to have a criminal mind
I was addicted to tryin, never meant to do time
My epitaph will read "Was the last of Gs
Kicked the shit to make the white man bleed
God bless the dead"
[Chorus - 2pac:]
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
God bless the dead
[2pac:]
Man, ain't nobody promised me a thang
I been caught up in this game
Ever since I was a little motherfucka wantin to hang
I can see 'em in my head, pow
Memories of my nigga but he dead now
Lookin back in my yearbook all the years took
Half my peers, they're stretched for years
And if I die will they all shed tears
Two to the dome, leave me alone, let me get my head clear
Paranoid got me lookin in the mirror
Behind me, life without my nine, I'd rather do the time
See I'm old enough to know that ain't no justice
Fuck the police 
&
 all the courts same way they fucked us
And why the hell am I locked in jail
They let them white boys free, we be shocked as hell
In my mind I can see it comin
And all the time it's a plot to keep a nigga runnin
By keepin gun 
&
 never run unless I'm comin at ya
Cry later but for now let's enjoy the laughter
God bless the dead
[Chorus]

Rest in peace to all the motherfuckas that passed too early
All the young motherfuckas that was took in they prime
Real motherfuckin Gz, this one is for you

Yo Big this is to you my nigga
Springfield Hollis crew, Thug Life, YGz
Sendin they respect, know I mean?
You my nigga for life, forever
You're always gonna be with a nigga
No matter what, don't forget that
I pray before I go to sleep
"Dear God save my place before I start to eat, cause times is hard
So I'm covered to my knees, oh why?
Why you had to take my nigga with the rock I buy?
You had to take a good one, a ghetto hood son, uzi weighin a ton
Niggas terrified of comin from the young gun
Hearin that they did it outta fear don't amaze me
But it's mind blowin, so I'm flowin goin crazy
Slip for cock the gun but he didn't run like a punk
He shoulda had the gauge in the trunk
For spunk is what he had, kid, I'd ratha attack Big
Now ya bout to smell the aftermath of what the mack did
Wannabe suckers wanna test, I'm tellin you, yes
The teflon's bout to rip through your fuckin vest
Guess who? I'll make a mess of your crew quick
The spirit Biggie Smalls and the ??? clique, yeah

Good Life 
(feat. Big Syke, E.D.I.)
[2Pac]
I was so money orientated, initiated as a thug
Fiendin for wicked adventures, ambitious as I was
Picture a nigga on the verge of livin insane
I sold my soul for a chance to kick it and bang
Now tell if I'm wrong
but sayin "Fuck the world" got you deeper in my songs
Drinkin 'til I earl, spendin money 'til it's gone
It's the good life - maybe niggaz got it goin on
Now maybe if I died, and came back, wouldn't have to slang crack
Addicted to the game, so obviously we came strapped
Please forgive me for my wicked ways, fuck a bitch
Bad Boy niggaz eat a dick a day, bumpin this
Lord have mercy it's a slaughter
So wicked that my tracks is wettin niggaz like it's water
I learned my lessons as a thug in these wicked ass hood fights
But I'm a baller now, nigga, I live the good life
[Chorus]
This is the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggaz that, trust them hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
and live the good life, cause thug niggaz don't die
We live the good life, fuck my foes
God bless the dumb niggaz that, trust these hoes
Found a way to stack money guaranteed to rise
and live the good life, cause thug niggaz don't die
[Big Syke]
No one knows what the, future holds, but you
Haha.. listen close
They say reach in yo' heart and you'll find your mind
Every day in the streets, got my foresight blind
My after time is narrow, peepin down the barrel of a foe
Just a nigga or a killer I don't know so
who makes the call will I fall a victim like the rest?
Slug in the chest, one in the dome and make sure I'm gone
Send me home all alone in these cold streets
In desperation constantly drinkin and I can't sleep
Neck deep strugglin tryin to survive
SOme wanna die I wanna stay alive, eyes on the prize
Let me modify this whole region
I declare this sucker duckin season, give me the reason
why I should change, into a softie
.. after living so loftily
It cost me my soul out of control in a devil's world
Me, my niggaz, and my girl - livin the good life!
[Chorus]
[E.D.I.]
I spend my days and nights not knowin if, strays in flight
gon' finally catch me, it's the good life, can you hear me?
Clearly over the edge, soon as I wake up
Last night we off the hook, doin way too much
But it's the fast lane only, big dealin big ceiling
All for the money, some kill some squeal
All for the money, most ain't even real
but we still call 'em homies, now what the fuck is that?
Fake love, fake thugs are, all in the game
I watch 'em all plot and fall while we come up and gain
Outlaw never surrender is the call when you hear us comin
Better start to get to runnin 'fore my click get to gunnin
Still in the midst of all the stress and pain
I'm still tryin to get a hold of the game, livin that good life

Got My Mind Made Up 
(feat. Daz, Kurupt, Method Man, Redman)
[Verse One: Daz]
You find an MC like me who's strong
Leavin motherfucker's aborted, with no verbal support
And when I command the microphone I gets deadly as Kahn though
With a bear and a snake and a panda, I'm on those 
Who can withstand, the mo' power I gain
and make it possible for me to drop a few to wreck ya brain
Imagine and keep on wishin upon a star
Finally realizing who the fuck we are
When I penetrate, it's been withstandin, faded
would it be the greatest MC of all time
When I created rhyme for the simple fact
When I attack I crush your pride
My intention to ride, every time all night
I'm faced with the scars beyond this one bar
for me to put down my guard, I'm faced with it, I'm a ride
breakin in gas with the six-eight all day
In and out with my pay
I'm soon to count the bodies...
[Verse Two: Tupac]
So mandatory my elevation my lyrics like orientation
So you can be more familiar with tha nigga you facin
We must be based on nothin better than communication
Known to damage and highly flamable like gas stations
Sorry I left that ass waitin
No more procrastination give up to fate, and get that asss shakin
I'm bustin and makin motherfuckers panic
Don't take ya life for granted put that ass in the dirt
You swear the bitch was planted
My lyrics motivate the planet
It's similar to Rhythm Nation
but thugged out, forgive me Janet
Who's in control I'm acvtivatin yo souls
You know, the way the games get controlled
Yo, two years ago, a friend of mine
Told me Alize and Cristal blows your mind
Bear witness to the dopest fuckin rhyme I wrote
Takin off my coat, clearing my throat
[Chorus: Method Man]
I got my mind made up, come on... (come on)
get in get in too 
[get on it]
let it ride (get wit it) tonight's tha night
I got my mind made up, come on...
get in get in too
let it ride... tonight's tha night
[Verse Three: Kurupt]
Well I comes through with two packs
of the bomb prophalaks for protection
So my fuckin sac won't collapse
Cause nowaday's, shit's evading the x-rays
Sending young motherfuckers to an early grave
I wonder, if my terrifying tactics of torturing MC's
shows my heart's as cold as the tundra
Electryfing like thunder, I'm just too much
Rough and raw with that motherfuckin poisonous touch
I'm an MC with lyrics that's tha fuckin bom-bay
Ya got dissed, that's before it's ingest like balmay
My rhymes, I leave a mark on ya mind
As the deadly vibes spread through ya head like sand pine
There's no escape, nah I ain't blastin
I use my mental to assassinate assassin's for those askin
Opposed to laughin, raw maniacal villian
Laughter enhances the chances of tha killin
Why is that?  Cuz smilin faces decieve
You best believe, to MC's I'm the deadliest disease
My thoughts rip ya throat and make it hard to breathe
Ya whole camp's under seige, and I'm Jason Vorhees
In the heat of the night is when I defeat and ignite mikes
My verbal snipe, your vocab on site
I'm out tha cut, uncut and raw with no clause for all
So all my rhymes hit and split tha bricks on the wall
Ya already have an idea about tha superior sphere
The greater rhyme creator on both sides of tha equator
I rock from here to there, to Philly and back
To LA on the spot where I rock and bust like straps
As your views get overshadowed when you come in contact
Beware, set and prepare to enter verbal combat
[Verse Four: Method Man]
Fuck you losers, while you fake jacks I makes maneuvers
like Hitler, stickin up 
[jews]
 wit german 
[lugers]
The Mr. Meth-Tical from Staten Isle
Will be back after this mess-age don't touch tha dial
Rarely do you see an MC out for justice
Got my gun powder and my musket -- blaooow!!
Melons get swellings, I paint mental pictures like Magellen
Half of my Clan's three deep felons
Niggaz best protect they joints for Nine-Nickel
Man I stay on point like icicles
Now who wanna test Tical then touch Tical
All up in your motherfuckin mouth
Head banger boogie
Catch me on tour with Al Doogie
Method Man roll too tight, you can pull me
Better take one and pass or that's that ass
Your vital statistics are low and fallin fast
Johnny Blaze out to get loot like Johnny Cash
Play a game of Russian Roulette and have a blast
[Verse Five: Redman]
Aiyyo, lyrical gas spittin tha criminal tactics
Non-believers get my dick and genitals backwards
Let's face it, there's no replacement
Taste this, mad underground basement, shit I'm laced with
Avalanche on ya whole camp when I'm splifted
Funk Doctor who? Spock bitch don't get it twisted
I got connects like Federal Express
to get the fresh package of bless, tha dogs can't fetch
Got the clear spot from tha rear block
to bust til every nigga here drop, men I fear not
Hold ya nose and blow out til ya ears pop
Since ya crew suit you to shift now you claim that you get's lot
With, this underground cannabis
I'm dangerous like John the bomb analyst
Then proceeds like keys
My degrees freeze consecutively like EPMD LP's
Lick off a shot and hit ya fam by mistake
So I erase the whole front row at the wake
I planned my escape in case jake or a snake bust it
I'm the one pushin the hearse in the first place
Confidence for you shaky ass folks
Pump for Rockafella for the day he got smoked
choke, off this anecdote got you ope
Get roast, by my lyrics Billy Dee .45 Colt
And I'm out for nine nickel (INS tha rebels)
West, list this, this, this...

Guess Who's Back 
Guess who's back?
[2Pac]
Drop the drums, here it comes, only got
two minutes to bounce, and every second counts
Better press, wreck on your tech, here we go, set pass the Moet
My trickery's more slippery when wet
Wicked as I flip, don't trip, get a grip
It'll kick, if the bass line's thick, it's a hit
Everybody's got a mic now, its like a hobby
But more like a job, cause bootleggers tryin to rob me
And little man wants to be a rap, star
Make papes, hit skins, drive a fat car
It ain't easy, sleazy even
Deceivin those we, believe in
No benefits, just tricks and chicks
Knock a pig to pick, so here's a stick to lick
I shoot a gift, til there ain't none left
And if I find that the track sound def
I catch wreck till I lose my breath
That's how it goes in the land of broke
I dispose of those, rock shows, and collect my dough
Now I suppose I'm the bad guy, why?
I say, "Hi," and try to stay high
Life's a mess don't stress, test.. of givin
but be thankful that you're livin.. blessed
Guess who's back, comin back with the track supplied
by Special Ed and Ak, comin right and exact
I'm fightin it back, now snap, where they at?
When it's time to go to combat, guess who's back
[Chorus: repeat 4X]
"Yes I'm back" - 
[Special Ed]
"Tupac is" .. back!!
[2Pac]
Drop the drums, here it comes, only got
one minute to bounce, and every second counts
I went from hustlin dicks, to makin hits, bustin flicks
Now I'm sure to be rich for ninety-six
I pull my 'capes on tapes, and make, papes
Trace the bass, to the tape with the baddest bass to date
I try to shake it but the pace is hard to break
Good thoughts I wait, cause they hate my black take
Yeah, it's on, and it's packed in the rap race
But if ya got a black face, its a rat race
I struggle to be rugged and raw, Dukes
Tryin to survive in the trials and lawsuits
Everybody wants to test me, WHY ME?
No lie, nuckas cried when they try me
Givin up the roughness, justice
I'ma bust as I'm rippin up 'nuff hits
And guess who's back?  No longer trapped
Cause I snapped on the ones that held me back, feel the contact
Ride the track, get I grip as I flip
Ghetto wickedness I kick, guess who's back?
[Chorus 1.5X]
"Yes I'm back, cause I never did front" -

Hail Mary 
(feat. Kastro, Young Noble, Prince Ital)
[Makaveli]
Makaveli in this... Killuminati, all through your body
The blow's like a twelve gauge shotty
Uhh, feel me!
And God said he should send his one begotten son
to lead the wild into the ways of the man
Follow me; eat my flesh, flesh and my flesh
[Chorus: Makaveli]
Come with me, Hail Mary
Run quick see, what do we have here
Now, do you wanna ride or die
La dadada, la la la la
[Makaveli]
I ain't a killer but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to gettin pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words bein quoted
Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God hoping that he's listenin
Seein niggaz comin for me, to my diamonds, when they glistenin
Now pay attention, rest in peace father
I'm a ghost in these killin fields
Hail Mary catch me if I go, let's go deep inside
the solitary mind of a madman who screams in the dark
Evil lurks, enemies, see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break, to the flame
Set trip, empty out my clip, never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corrupted, fucked in this shit
Stuck, niggaz is lucky if we bust out this shit, plus
mama told me never stop until I bust a nut
Fuck the world if they can't adjust
It's just as well, Hail Mary
[Chorus 2X]
[Makaveli]
Penetentiaries is packed with promise makes
Never realize the precious time the bitch niggaz is wastin
Instutionalized I lived my life a product made to crumble
But too hardened for a smile, we're too crazy to be humble, we ballin
Catch me father please, cause I'm fallin, in the liquor store
That's the Hennessee I hear ya callin, can I get some more?
Hail til I reach Hell, I ain't scared
Mama checkin in my bedroom; I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do
One life to live but I got nuttin to lose, just me and you
on a one way trip to prison, sellin drugs
We all wrapped up in this livin, life as Thugs
To my homeboys in Quentin Max, doin they bid
Raise hell to this real shit, and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be down in the dark
Thuggin eternal through my heart, now Hail Mary nigga
[Chorus 2X]
[Kastro]
They got a APB, out on my Thug family
Since the Outlawz run these streets, like these skanless freaks
Our enemies die now, walk around half dead
Head down, K blasted off Hennessee and Thai
Tryin it, mixed it, now I'm twisted blisted and high
Visions of me, Thug livin gettin me by
Forever live, and I multiply survived by Thugs
When I die they won't cry unless they comin with slugs
[Young Noble]
Peep the whole scene and whatever's goin on around me
Brain kinda cloudy, smoked out feelin rowdy
Ready to wet the party up, and whoever in that motherfucker
Nasty new street, slugger my heat seeks suckers
on the regular mashin in a stolen black Ac Integ-ra
Cock back, sixty seconds til the draw that's when I'm dead in ya
Feet first, you got a nice gat but my heat's worse
From a Thug to preachin church, I gave you love now you eatin dirt
Needin work, and I ain't the nigga to put you on
Cause word is bond when I was broke I had to hustle til dawn
That's when sun came up, there's only one way up
hold ya head and stay up, to all my niggaz get ya pay and weight up
[Kastro]
If it's on then it's on, we break beat-breaks 
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate
to this shit I don't got, be the shit I gotta take
Dealin with fate, hoping God don't close the gate
If it's on then it's on, we break beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate
to this shit I don't got, be the shit I gotta take
Dealin with fate, hoping God don't close the gate 
[Chorus (repeats in background)]
[Prince Ital]
We've been traveling on this wayward road
Long time til I be take a 'eavy load
But we ride, ride it like a bullet
Hail Mary, Hail Mary
We won't worry everyting will come real
Free like the bird in the tree
We won't worry everyting will come real
Yes we free like the bird in the tree
We runnin from the penitentiary
This is the time for we liberty
Hail Mary, Hail Mary

Happy Home 
Home man.. hey.. let's turn this house into a happy home
This for all the homeboys that couldn't get they happy home
Let's turn this house into a happy home
Long as one of us got it, some of us got it
Let's turn this house into a happy home
You know how that is, stay down for mine
Outlaw.. look
[2Pac]
Now we've been kickin it for quite some time
Remained beside me through my trials in this life of crime
We divorced so many times I forgot to count
I never hit you, not a coward, rather leave your house
Remember back in December when we was tight?
Sippin Alize and Cristal, whylin every night - in my bedroom!
Promised that I commit to you soon
Tongue-kissed me every time you seen me step inside a room
Straight out the hood
We promised to be good to each other, plus I love you
So I know you gon' make a good mother
Just try to understand if I change at times
it's only cause I never owned anything that's mine
So I'm tryin you can stay with my momma but keep the drama to a low
Never call the police, I never call you bitch and ho
We were all born hungry in this world alone
Finally moved out my mom's house, and got a happy home
[Chorus]
Ha..ppy.. home.. 
(let's turn this house into a happy home)
Ha..ppy.. home.. 
(finally made it out my mom's house, got a happy home)
Ha..ppy.. home.. 
(turn this house into a happy home)
Ha..ppy.. home.. 
[2Pac]
Goin through hard times, ghetto child of mine
I wonder if you have to suffer for your father's crimes
To be honest it's a hard road
Just keep your faith in God, knowin you'll get scarred though
Look at him walkin and talkin, a lil' child with my eyes and mouth
Father watch over lil' seeds, help me guide them out
Had to change my whole lifestyle, married my baby's momma
Made her my wife now, I'm tryin hard y'all
Maybe in time I'll be a better man
Watchin the older couples, handle it like veterans
Show me the meaning of forever and together we rise
If it would help our child grow, then together we'd die
Why - question my love, it's so easy to see
Without my family all I'm left with is a shadow of me
After all the arguments, and the nights alone
Now it's time to live the good life, inside a happy home
[Chorus]
Ha..ppy.. home.. 
(turn this house into a happy home)
Ha..ppy.. home.. 
(finally got to live the good life, inside a happy home)
Ha..ppy.. home.. 
(turn this house into a happy home)
Ha..ppy.. home..

Happy home
[singers]
All these problems got me goin
We got a family, of our own
I just wanna happy home
(turn this house into a happy home)
No man's made to stand alone
I promise I won't do you wrong
I just want a happy home
(finally made it out my mom's house, got a happy home)

Ha..ppy.. home..

And then you got some mutha-fuckas that say they your enemies
But in real life they eyes is on your money

But in real life those niggas will be the snitches
Its a dirty game y'all
Y'all got ta be careful about who you fuck with and who you don't fuck with
Cause the shit get wild y'all
Keep your mind on your riches, Baby

Shit I'm legendary niggas scary and paralyzed
Nothing more I despise than a liar

My mama told me When I was to see
Just a vicious mutha fucker while these devils left me free
I proceed to make them shiver
when I deliver
Criminal lyrics
from a world wide mob figure
Thug niggas from everywhere Mr. Mackaveli
Niggas is waiting for some thug shit, thats what they tell me
So many rumors but I'm infinitely Immortal Outlaw
Switching up on you ordinary bitches
like a south paw you get let
And every breath I breathe untill the moment I'm deceased
Will be another moment ballin' as a 'G'
I rip the crowd, then I start again
Internally I live in sin
untill the moment that they let me breathe again
The heartz of men
[Chorus]
The Heartz of Men
My lyrical verse with so much pain
that to some niggas it hurts
My guns bust
And if you ain't one of us
it gets worse
Bitch niggas get their eyes swoll
in fly mode
I'm a homicidal outlaw
and five-o, get your lights on, fight long
tonights gonna be a fuckin' fight
so we might roll
My own homies say I'm heartless
But I'm a 'G' to this 'til the day I'm gone that's regardless
Drive-by, niggas bow down
thought I'd rot in jail, paid bail, well niggas out now
Throw up your hands if you thugged out
First nigga act up
first nigga gettin' drugged out
I can be a villian if ya let me
I'll Muthafuck ya
if ya do upset me
tell the cops to come and get me
rip the crowd like a phone number
Then start again, don't have no muthafuckin' friends nigga
Look inside the heartz of men
[Chorus]
In The Heartz of Men
In The Heartz of Men
To all my niggas engaged in making money in the fifty states
Keep your mind on your chips and fuck a punk bitch
No longer living in fear
my pistol close in hand
Convinced this is my year
like I'm the chosen man
Give me my money and label me as a don
If niggas is having problems
smoke'em, fire and bomb
I died and came back,
I hustle with these lyrics as if it's a game of crack
Thugin' is in my spirit
I'm lost and not knowing
scar'd up
but still flowing
energized and still going
Uhh, can it be fate
that makes a sick muthafucka break
On these jealous ass coward cuz they evil and fake
What will it take ?
Give me that bass line
I'm feeling bombed
Deathrow baby, don't be alarmed
The homie Quik gave a nigga a beat and let me start again
Represent
cause I've been sent
The heartz of men

Heaven Ain't Hard 2 Find 
[Tupac Talking]
Heaven ain't hard to find
(All you gotta do is look)
[Tupac]
Simply because you nervous, let me start off with my conversation
Hoping my information, eleviates the hesitiation
I can see it clearly now
catch you smiling through your frown
I'm askin' Baby Boo are you down ?
Although I know you've heard about my reputation 
across the nation
"Mr. I get around"
My temptaion got me dripping wet 
perspiration
I'm activated by the moves your making
Baby why you faking? strip naked get the love making
See its all in your mind, so every time I sip a glass of wine
I fantasize till that ass is mine
Never gettin' but wanting, never touching but wishing
A straight thug on a mission until I get what I'm missing
Stop with the beeper, baby Listen,
I know you're grown, but pay attention
Let me hypnotize with my tounge kissen'
This is a message to bomb bodies and all dimes
Turn around one more time
Heaven ain't hard to find
[Chorus]
(Heaveeen)
Heaven ain't hard to find
(Heaven ain't hard to find)
Heaven ain't hard to find
Infact you can have it just have faith
Just like a little kid, still believing in magic
It takes a lot of scarifice 
with all the lonely nights on tour
I need somebody I can trust in my life
Let me apply the brakes 
baby you're moving to fast
My conversations are getting deeper, but first let me ask 
Are you afraid of a thug ? 
and have you ever made love 
with candles and bubbles sipping in your tub
Touch me and let me activate your bloodpressure
This Thug Passion 
help the average man love better
Picture me naked and glistening beneath the moonlight mist
Take a shot of that alazhay 
come give me a kiss
And maybe we can be better friends 
perhaps we'll be closer
I'll be the thug in your life
baby and you'll be my soulja
And I know it takes some time
And you got a lot of questions on your mind
But relax, in due time
Heaven Ain't Hard to Find
[Chorus]
(Heaveeen)
Heaven ain't hard to find
(Heaven ain't hard to find)
You think we all dogs, thats why you cautious when I approached you
Been talking since you arrived, but not a word is spoken
Through my eye contact, I wink and you respond back
Look at me 
whats all that ? Huh
its like the closer you get, Baby the quicker I'm speaking
I got a flight out Chicago, lets kick it this weekend
I'm sipping Heneesee and coke 
tho' addicted to weed smoke
I'm fiendin' for your body even mo'
Oh god help me identify me truest thoughts
your hidden motives full of passion who would of thought
Come hollar at me baby, love me for my thug nature
Far from a playa hater, label me a money maker
Straight heart breaker
Baby we can be friends 
I can soup you in my Benz 
we'll ride 
I'll let you floss it for your friends
Once we begin 
until the end, it gets better with time
I'm makin' love to your mind baby
Heaven ain't hard to find

Heaven ain't hard to find

The game's been good to me

Oh, you tink life is yours?
Life ain't na somethin you can rap with
Ooh come na ordinary game
Da game na somethin you can rap with
Me's a player you know?
I do not, play in no game
Me just, make money, dollars, everytime seen?
[Verse One: 2Pac]
Now how can I explain how this game laced, plus with this fame
I got enemies do anything to break me, my attitude changed
Got to the point where I was driven, twenty-four/seven
Money's my mission, just a nigga tryin to make a livin
These busta tricks don't want no mail
They spendin they riches on skanless bitches
who'll stay petrified in jail
It's hell, plus all the dealers want a meal ticket
Jealous-ass bitches, playa-hatin but we still kick it
Always keep my eyes on the prize, watch the police
Seen so much murder, neighborhoods gettin no sleep
But still, I get my money on major, continuously
Communicatin through my pager, niggaz know me
Don't have no homies cause they jealous, I hustle solo
Cause when I'm broke I got no time for the fellas, listen
Ain't nothin poppin 'bout no work nigga, I ain't no joke
Fuck what they say and get your dough nigga
Heavy in the game

Well lemme shoot some of this how heavy type of shit..
Certain niggaz wanna stick to the game, yousea trick to the game
Waitin upon your turn, so when will you learn?
Ain't no turns given, niggaz be twistin and takin shit
Puttin they sack down, then puttin they mack down
Me myself I hustle with finesse yes I'm an Oakland baller
Rule number one: check game, and fo' sho' you gon' respect game
Be yo' own nigga meanin buy yo' own dope
Cause that front shit is punk shit, somethin I never funked with
Be true to this game and this game will be true to you
That's real shit; disrespect, see what this here do to you
That jackin and robbin, despisin your homie
ain't healthy, niggaz be endin up dead 'fore they get wealthy
But not me though, I'm sewin somethin major
so what I reap is boss -- that's why my public status is floss
Went from a, young nigga livin residential
to a, young nigga workin presidential

[Lady Levi]
Me nigga Tu-pac ALWAYS look good
You know that's true 'im look good every time
Ooh, pussy war?  Step up

Ooh, we take game, we WON

Any by now, all, yi haffa forget fi we WON
Everytime
[Verse Three: 2Pac]
I'm just a young black male, cursed since my birth
Had to turn to crack sales, if worse come to worse
Headed for them packed, jails, or maybe it's a hearse
My only way to stack mail, is out here doin dirt
Made my decisions do or die, been hustlin since junior high
No time for askin why, gettin high, gettin mine
Put away my nine, cause these times call for four-five sales
cause life is hell and everybody dies
What about these niggaz I despise -- them loud talkin cowards 
shootin guns into crowds, jeapordizin lives
Shoot em right between them niggaz eyes, it's time to realize
follow the rules or follow them fools that die
Everybody's tryin to make the news, niggaz confused
Quit tryin to be an O.G. and pay your dues
If you choose to apply yourself, go with the grain
and come the riches and the bitches and the fame
Heavy in the game

Boy, ya nah bitch!

Hell 4 A Hustler 
[2Pac]
Get on yo' knees ni**a
Get on yo' knees and pray
Huh, increase the doses, bustin whoever closest
Thug livin, hell or prison, never losin my focus
I'm makin money moves manditory
In a discussion my past records tell a story
Picture ni**az we rushin and still bustin
til the cops come runnin, duck in abandoned buildings
Ditchin my gun, homeboy the motherf**kin villain
I live the lifestyles of drug dealers, but now legit list
So I laugh til I cry, when the law come get me
No baby momma drama, ni**a miss me, why plant seeds
in a dirty bi**h, waitin to trick me, not the life for me
Livin carefree, til I'm buried - and if they dare me
I'm bustin on ni**az until they scurry, I'm clearly
a man of military means in my artillery
Watchin over me through every murder scene
From adolescence, to my early teens, thought we was gonna die
Sellin dope to all the fiends, at times I wanna cry
And still, we try to change the past, in vain
Never knowin if this game'll last, feelin ashamed
of cocaine, the product of the devil, am I sellin my soul?
Got tired of small time livin, ni**az tellin me no
I got MINE, f**k THEM OTHER SUCKERS, that's the mentality
Jealous-a*s bustaz, make it hell for us
[Chorus: 2Pac (and harmonizing vocals) repeat 2X]
Lord, help me change my ways
Show a little mercy on judgment day
It ain't me, I was raised this way
I never let em play me for a busta, make it hell 4 a hustler
[Outlawz]
Now in these last days and times I takes mines so serious
Gotta get that paper quickly and escape the sickness
If I fail, then I suffer, bein broke is hell 4 a hustler
So I stay strugglin and jugglin with all the might I can muster
Since a youngster, been money hungry, moved in
One's five's and ten's was funny money
So I sets my sights bigger, four figures or mo'
Real ni**a fo' sho', out in the cold for dough
What you thought? ??, lost homies in plenty battles
Last two years shed plenty tears, and I'll send plenty at you
Let me catch you slippin, you soft ni**az is outta here
In case you forgot, we on the same s**t that got us here
[Outlawz]
Yo, to every step I take, every foul I make
Every jail I break, every mill' I ate
Head to head, whoever hustle hardest
On the block duckin charges, ni**a f**k the sergeant
He got a job, all my bottles got a pinch of coke
Listen tho' I'm missin dough I gotta gather mo'
Hell naw, dead blocks with red tops but now a ni**a sell words
for all my young thugs in jail in Jerz
They made it hell 4 a hustler, I bails high as f**k son
Dyin luck none supply us with much guns
I buck one, just to let you know that I can touch ya
Slangin cracks or raps, still hell 4 a hustler
[Chorus]
[2Pac]
No insanity plea for me, I ride the beef til I burn
Sensor me and bar your kids from the lessons I learned
And in turn I'm hostile guess you could call me anti-social
ni**az shakin like they caught the holy ghost when I approach em
Try to politic, before I smoke em, like Sun Zu
ni**az do unto these snitches, before it's done to you
And if the cops come arrest me in the evening
best believe they comin for my dogs in the mornin
And if I die by a slug, the death of a true thug
Tell me will my ni**az mourn me? Gettin blowed out
High, watch me murder the bird, before he testify
Strikes, walkin close to my third, I live a trouble life
And if you dream be a part of my team
From Long Beach to Queens, drug dealers to ex-fiends
Keep yo' eyes on the prize, ni**a watch for bustaz
Either heaven or jail, it's still hell 4 a hustler
[Chorus]
[2Pac]
This is how we ride
Not knowin if we'll live or die
Catch me rollin with my motherf**kin guns on the side
In case of drama, I'm the first to break wild til they all die
This is how we ride
Not knowin if we'll live or die
Catch me rollin with my motherf**kin guns on the side
In case of drama, I'm the first to break wild
until they all die, Outlaw
Yes (change my ways) yes
The Black Jesuz guide us through this
Weary weary weary weary
Only God can save us
Nuttin but boss players
Outlawz and thugs

Hellrazor 
(feat. Stretch)
Major! Hell motherfuckin yeah
This one goes out to my nigga Mike Coolin, hell yeah
Mama raised a hellrazor... born thuggin
Heartless and mean, muggin at sixteen
On the scene watchin fiends buggin
Kickin up dust with the older G's
Soakin up the game that was told to me
I ain't never touched a gat that I couldn't shoot, I learned
not to trust the bitch from the prostitutes, was taught lessons
A young nigga askin questions while other suckers was guessin
I was ganked for sexin
Elementary wasn't meant for me, can't regret it
I'm headed for the penitentiary, I'm cuttin class
and I'm buckin blastin, straight mashin
Mobbin through the overpass laughin
While these other motherfuckers try to figure out, no doubt
They jealous of a nigga's clout, tell me Lord
Can ya feel me?  I keep my finger in the trigger
Cause some nigga tried to kill me
and mama raised a hellraizor, everyday gettin paid
Police on my pager, straight stressin
A fugitive my occupation is under question
Wanted for investigation, and even though
I'm marked for death, I'ma spark til I lose my breath
Motherfuckers, every time I see the paper
I see my picture, when a nigga's gettin richer
They come to get ya, it's like a motherfuckin trap
And they wonder why it's hard bein black
Dear Lord can ya feel me, gettin major, unhh
[Chorus: Stretch]
Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin major
Lord be my savior, unnh
[Repeat 4X]
Mama raised a hellrazor
[2Pac]
 Dear Lord can ya feel me
Stress gettin major, unnh
Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin major
Tell me Lord can ya feel me, show a sign
Damn near running outta time, everybody's dyin
Mama raised a hellrazor, can't figure
Why you let the police beat down niggaz
I'm startin to think all the rich in the world is safe
While the po' babies restin in the early graves
God come save the youth
Ain't nothin else to do but have faith in you
Dear Lord I live the life of a Thug, hope you understand
Forgive me for my mistakes, I gotta play my hand
And my hand's on the sixteen-shot, semi-automatic
crooked cop killin Glock, tell me Lord
Can ya feel me? Show a way
I'm prayin but my enemies won't go away
And everywhere I turn I see niggaz burn
Every nigga that I know's on death row
My younger homie's seventeen and he paid a price
Little young motherfucker doin triple life
Though I tell him in his letters, it's gettin better
If my nigga knew the truth he'd hit the roof
Just heard ya baby's mama was smoked out, fuck the drama
Wanna break my Loc out, smokin blunts
Gettin drunk off that Tanqueray gin
Bout to break my nigga out the fuckin pen
Mama raised a hellrazor, uhh, yeah
C'mon, uhh, mama raised a hellrazor
Uhh, dear Lord can ya feel me, stress gettin major
(Lord be my savior, unnh)
[Chorus: Stretch]
Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin major
Lord be my savior, unhh
[repeat 2X]
Mama raised a hellrazor, stress gettin major
Dear Lord can ya hear me, it's just me
A young nigga tryin to make it on these rough streets
I'm on my knees beggin please come and SAVE ME
THE WHOLE WORLD done made a nigga crazy!
I got my three-five-seven can't control it
Screamin die motherfucker and he's loaded
Everybody run for cover, I cause shit
Thug Life motherfucker, duck quick
Now am I wrong if I am don't worry me
Cause do or die gettin high til the bury me
Dear Lord if ya hear me, tell me why
Little girl like LaTasha, had to die
She never got to see the bullet, just heard the shot
Her little body couldn't take it, it shook and dropped
And when I saw it on the news I see busta girl killin 'Tasha
Now I'm screamin fuck the world, in the end
it's my friends, that flip-flop
Lip-locked on my dick when my shit drop
Thug Life motherfucker I lick shots
Every nigga on my block dropped two cops
Dear Lord can ya hear me, when I die
Let a nigga be strapped, fucked up, and high
with my hands on the trugger, Thug nigga
Stressin like a motherfuckin drug dealer
And even in the darkest nights, I'm a Thug for Life
I got the heart to fight now
Mama raised a hellraiser why cry
That's just life in the ghetto, do or die

High Speed 
[E.D.I Amin]
I speak
For all my ni**az livin' in the rush
Slow it down just a notch baby
It's goin' be alright, it's goin' be alright
[2Pac + E.D.I Amin]
Life in High Speed
f**k the punishment, tie weed
I gonna buy me a gun
f**k doin' time
[2Pac]
I live life High Speed
Slightly disillusioned by weed
I breed thug muthaf**kas even worse than me
When I bleed, my enemies best to flee quickly, on me
My army, ni**az decieve swiftly
Look at you now, why you wanna hang out?
I pull the hammer back
Strike wit' a cannon and blow your muthaf**kin' back out
They blast but I'm still standin'
Slightly scarred deep
Questions for the lord, why he don't like me, guard my soul
Though my life was hard with no remorse
I absorb bomb less provide protection for the boss
Rollin' in my double, raw, rugged, and ruthless
Keep a vest through these hard times, knowin' it's useless
And my crew, who could should be mistaken for Jews
We all about our past, blast if he break the rules
Fools done snitched for the D.A., be heavensent
Switched like a stone-bi**h, turned str8 severed then, why?
Then they wonder why ni**az die
Put your family in danger just to get high
Now, what the hell can we get from jail?
More tricks for the crime rate, this is hell
Bail out, a thug ni**a fresh out the jailhouse
Open your safe count and take all your mail out
Whatever happens happens
Whoever falls dies
We fresh out of time, livin blind, so we all ride
In times like these, chronic and tie weed
Puffin' through these High Speedz
And people say
[Chorus (2Pac):]
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and Sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and Sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night
[Yaki Kadafi]
Verbal a*sa*sin, I hit the corner fast, blastin'
I plan to stretch your chest plate back like elastic
No need to push me to slippin'
I love beef, like pussy and pistols
For all you pussies that's soft as tissue
I ride plottin' like the fall guy out the roof
Bustin' at you wise guy, gettin' high, sippin' hundred proof
Gettin' your neck joints low to verdict wit' mine
Get that a*s attacked, murdered, and robbed, blind from behind
Grab your shots', callin'
Catchin ni**az while they stormin'
Kickin' his door in
And get your whole f**kin' family a' mournin'
Plus all you itchy-bi**hy types can't touch me
Frontin' like your hard
I'll play your f**kin' yard like a trussel
[Chorus (2Pac):]
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and Sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and Sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night
[E.D.I Amin]
At times, I look through times wit' so much anger
Wonderin' why it keeps on pa*sin' bringin' me the danger
No singal hard time is a good one
At times I'm amazed
Now what the mutha f**k a hood done
What we do to get paid
All day, for the almighty, dollar
Don't even bother to holla
We all destined to be swallowed
By the same thing we lust for
Threw away our morals in bags of dust, more
ni**az is dying tommorrow
We, bet on all time
ni**a the clocks tickin'
Approachin' is the day you only know your glocks spittin
Cops sittin', politicians pa*sin' laws you ain't knowin'
Soon that money goin' be illegal when you got it
Keep your dough up
But I ain't goin' tell you, what?, to stop chasin' paper
Man, I'm just like ya'll, I worry 'bout that s**t later
Put the metal to the pedal, slash up ni**a, blaze
Lets get blowed out High Speed til the end of my dayz
Now my people say
[Chorus (2Pac): repeat 5X]
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
I'm gonna buy me a gun
Then what's next?
Food and Sex, house parties in the projects
We goin' all night
[2Pac]
High Speedz (we goin' all night)
Life of an Outlaw, ghetto starz (we goin' all night)
(Yes) I'm gonna buy me a gun
Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?
(I'm gonna buy me a gun)
For my ni**az on the WestSide and the EastSide
And the NorthSide and the SouthSide

It'll get better... 
[coughing]
Ay do this Thug style main, Thug style
When this whole beat drop we just gon' run it to em bet
It's all good, uhh
I never had much, ran with a bad bunch
Little skinny kid sneakin weed in my bag lunch
And all through Junior High, we was just gettin by
And drivebys robbed my homies of their young lives
I never did cry, and even though I had
pain in my heart, I was hopeless from the start 
They couldn't tell me nothin, they all tried to help to help me
The marijuana had my mind gone it wasn't healthy
I travelled places, caught cases, what a ill year
I felt the pain and the rain but I'm still here
Never did like the police, let the whole world know
Now I gets no peace, cause they chasin me down
And facin me now, what do I do?
These thangs that a Thug goes through
And still I rise so keep ya head up, and make ya mind strong 
It's a struggle every day but you gotta hold on
[Chorus: repeat 4X]
Hold on, be strong, hold on
Be strong, hold on
When it's on it's on
There's, never a good day, cause in my hood they
let they AK's pump strays where the kids play
And every Halloween, check out the murder scene
Can't help but duplicate the violence seen on the screen
My homies dyin 'fore they get to see they birthdays
These is the worst days, sometimes it hurts to pray
And even God turned his back on the ghetto youth
I know that ain't the truth, sometimes I look for proof
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto, and if it does
Does it matter if you blood or you cuz
Remember how it was, the picnics and the parties in the projects
Small time drinkin gettin high with them armies
Just another knucklehead kid from the gutter
I'm dealin with the madness, raised by a single mother
I'm tryin to tell you when it's on
You gotta keep your head to the sky and be strong, most of all hold on
[Chorus]
[Interlude:]
Hold on, be strong
I know them ain't tears comin down your face
When it's on it's on but
Wipe your eyes
Hold on, be strong
In this world
When it's on it's on but
Only the strong survive y'know
Hold on, be strong
Hmm, I know it's hard out there
When it's on it's on but
Welfare
Hold on, be strong
AIDS, earthquakes
Cause when it's on it's on but
Muggings, carjackings
Hold on, and be strong
Yeah we got problems
Cause when it's on it's on but
But believe me when I tell you
Hold on, and be strong
Things always get better
Cause when it's on it's on but
God don't like ugly
Hold on, and be strong
And God don't like no quitters
Cause when it's on it's on but
You know what Billie Holiday said bay-bee
Hold on, and be strong
God bless the child that can hold his own
Cause when it's on it's on but
Y'know?
Hold on, and be strong
You got to stand strong
Cause when it's on it's on but
And when these bustas try to knock you out your place
Hold on, and be strong
You stand there to they face
Cause when it's on it's on but
Tell em hold on, and be strong
Hold on, and be strong
The game don't stop
Cause when it's on it's on but
Hmmm
Hold on, and be strong
This here is black main
Cause when it's on it's on but
If you don't never leave nothin, learn one thing
Hold on, and be strong
It don't stop, til the casket drop
Hold on
Thug, for Life... feel me?
All my homeboys and my homegirls, stay strong
When things get bad, especially come the first and the fifteenth
Stay strong, and stay ballin, hold on
I'll catch y'all at the next life, we in traffic

Hold Ya Head 
My homeboys in Clinton And Rikers Island
Mumia Atumie, Gerino Pratt, 
All the political Prisoners
San Quiton
"Can you see him?"
"I See Him"
[2Pac:]
 "I'm Alive"
Yeah
One Thug, One Thug
How do we keep the music playing
One Thug, One Thug
I wake up early in the morning
My state so Military
Suckas Fantasize, Pictures of a 
Young Brother Buried
Was it me, The Weed, Or this life I lead
If daytime is for suckas then
Tonight we Bleed
Out for all that
Knowing that this world brings drawbacks
Look how this shit bumps 
Once I deliver these war raps
Meet me at the cemetary
Dressed in Black
Tonight we
Follow the dead
And those who won't be back
So if I die
To the same for me
Shed no tear
An Outlaw, thug living in this game, 
for years
Why worry,
Hope to god
Get me high
When I'm burried
Knowing deep inside me
Only if yah love
Come rush me to the gates of heaven
Let me picture for a while
How I live for my days, as a child
I wonder now
How do we outlast, always get cash
Stay strong if we all mash
Hold Your head
[Chorus]
How do we keep the music playing
How do we get ahead
To many young black brothers are dying
Living Fast, too fast
These felonies be like prophecies
Begging me to stop
Cuz These lawyers getting money
Everytime they knock us
Slashing pockets lyrically
Suckas fleed when they notice
Switched my name to Makaveli
Had the rap game closed
Expose foes, with my hocus pocus flows
They froze
Now suckas idealize my choosen Blows
More money mean litigating 
More Playa hating
Got a cell at the penn for me waiting
Is this my fate
Miss me with that mistermeaner thinking
Me fall back
Never That
Too much Tequilla drinking
We all that
Make them understand me
Hey I'll stay all night out with my Posse
Everyone roll with me is family
Cuz everybodies got me
Watch me paint a perfect vision
This life we living
Got us all meeting up in Prison
Last week I got a letter from my road dog
Written in Blood
Saying, "Please show a young playa love"
Hold your head
Hold it
[Chorus]
How do we keep the music playing
How do we get ahead
To many young black brothers are dying
Living Fast, too fast
God bless the child that can hold is own
Indeed
Enemies Bleed when I hold my chrome
Let these words be to last
to my unborn seeds
Hope to raise my young nation
In this world of greed
Currency means nothing if you still ain't free
Money breeds jealousy
Take the game from me
I hope for better days
Trouble comes naturally
Running from authorities
Till they capture me
And my AIM is to spread more smiles than tears
Utilalize lessons learned from my childhood years
Maybe Mama had it all right
Rest your head
Straight converstion all night
Bless the dead
To the homies that I usta have
That no longer roll
Catch a brother at the crossroads
Plus nobody knows my soul
Watching time pass
Through the glass of my drop top
Hold your head
[Chorus]
<BREAK>

Holla At Me 
(Niggas out there jelous cuz we be bailin' with Death Row

[Chorus: repeat 3X]
Gotta be carefull, can't let tha evil of tha money trap me
So when ya see me nigga

[Verse One: 2Pac]
Are you confused ?
You wonder how it feels to walk a mile inside tha shoes 
of a nigga who don't have a thing to loose
When me and you was homies
no one informed me it was all a scheme
You infiltrated my team and sold a niggas dreams
how could you do me like that ?
I took ya family in
I put some cash in ya pocket
made you a man again
and now you let tha fear put your ass in a place
complicated to escape
It's a fools fate
without your word
your a shell of a man
I lost respect for you nigga
we can never be friends
I know i'm runnin' through your head now
what could you do ?
If it was up to you
i'd be dead now
I let tha world know nigga you a coward
You could never be live
until you die
see tha mothafucken bitch in your eye
Type of Nigga, that let tha evil of tha money trap me
when ya see me nigga
ya better holla at me (holla at me)
can't let tha evil of tha money trap me
So when ya see me nigga
Ya better Holla at me
[Chorus: 2Pac]
(You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay)
So I gotta be carefull, can't let tha evil of tha money trap me
so when ya see me nigga

(You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay)
[Verse Two: 2Pac]
courious 
spittin' lyrics
on tha verge of furious
i'm addicted to currency
nigga that's why we're doin this
I got shot up, I surprised tha niggas tha way I got up
and then
I hit the studio
It's time to blow tha block up
No hesitation
this information got you contemplatin'
heartbreakin' and eliminatin' with this conversation
break him
and let him see tha face of a mental patient
it's a celebration 
of my criminal elevation
with the participation
I want members across tha fifty states
to keep tha nation anticipatin' until we break
will I be great, is it my fate ?
to live tha life of luxury
some niggas bought my tapes
so much jelousy it scares me
so be prepared
cause only tha strong survive
life isn't fair (fair)
probably never knew tha way it feels to die
so you figure fuck with me
I give that ass a try
Nigga, Holla at me
[Chorus]
(You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay)
(Ohhhhhh....)
[Verse Three: 2Pac]
I shoulda saw tha signs
I was blinded      
criminal minds of a young black brotha doin' time
so many brothas framed in this dirty game
it's a shame
so much pressure on my brain
while she blame me
Secrets in tha dark
only her and I know
now i'm sitten' in tha state pen
doin time for slow 
guess she made a bad decision
that got me livin' 
just like an animal
i'm caged up in state prison
my niggas dissin'
cause 
hell have no fury like a woman scorn
A cemetary full of mothafuckers got not knowin'
picture my prophecy
tha cops are attacking me, on top of me
i'm runnin' from tha coppers
but never let'em stop me
cause i'm a soulja 
hell, ever since I was a little nigga havin' fantasies
of one day getting older
Niggas is paranoid
trust
a no no
love is a mystery
Fuck tha po po,
Holla at me.....
So when you see me nigga
you better holla at me....
[Chorus]
(You better beware where you lay
We better not find where you stay)
(Niggas out there jelous cuz we be bailin' with Death Row
They try to playa hate
but they can't fade us tho'
We be mobbin' through tha neigborhood
Yeah
with that funky sound (so funky)
we be throwin' down)

(You better beware where you lay

Holla If Ya Hear Me 
Aww yeah, uhh, uhh
Holla if ya hear me, yeah!
[Verse One]
Here we go, turn it up, let's start
From block to block we snatchin hearts and jackin marks
And the punk police can't fade me, and maybe
We can have peace someday G
But right now I got my mind set up
Lookin down the barrel of my nine, get up
Cause it's time to make the payback fat
To my brothers on the block better stay strapped, black
And accept no substitutes
I bring truth to the youth tear the roof off the whole school
Oh no, I won't turn the other cheek
In case ya can't see us while we burn the other week
Now we got him in a smash, blast
How long will it last 'til the po' gettin mo' cash
Until then, raise up!
Tell my young black males, blaze up!
Life's a mess don't stress, test
I'm givin but be thankful that you're livin, blessed
Much love to my brothers in the pen
See ya when I free ya if not when they shove me in
Once again it's an all out scrap
Keep your hands on ya gat, and now ya boys watch ya back
Cause in the alleys out in Cali I'ma tell ya
Mess with the best and the vest couldn't help ya
Scream, if ya feel me; see it clearly?
You're too near me -

Pump ya fists like this
Holla if ya hear me - PUMP PUMP if you're pissed
To the sell-outs, livin it up
One way or another you'll be givin it up, huh
I guess cause I'm black born
I'm supposed to say peace, sing songs, and get capped on
But it's time for a new plan, BAM!
I'll be swingin like a one man, clan
Here we go, turn it up, don't stop
To my homies on the block gettin dropped by cops
I'm still around for ya
Keepin my sound underground for ya
And I'ma throw a change up
Quayle, like you never brought my name up
Now my homies in the backstreets, the blackstreets
They fell me when they rollin in they fat jeeps
This ain't just a rap song, a black song
Tellin all my brothers, get they strap on
And look for me in the struggle
Hustlin 'til other brothers bubble -

Will I quit, will I quit?
They claim that I'm violent, but still I keep
representin, never give up, on a good thing
Wouldn't stop it if we could it's a hood thing
And now I'm like a major threat
Cause I remind you of the things you were made to forget
Bring the noise, to all my boyz
Know the real from the bustas and the decoys
And if ya hustle like a real G
Pump ya fists if ya feel me, holla if ya hear me
Learn to survive in the nine-tre'
I make rhyme pay, others make crime pay
Whatever it takes to live and stand
Cause nobody else'll give a damn
So we live like caged beasts
Waitin for the day to let the rage free
Still me, till they kill me
I love it when they fear me -
[Chorus]

 Holla if ya hear me!

Oh s**t, caught that ni**a alone
Ain't that a bi**h
Hey, uh, this one here is, uhh
for them ni**az that be Johnny Dangerous when they be f**kin fifty deep
But they be f**kin cowards when they by theyselves
You know who I'm talkin about
(You know who I'm talkin about) that's right
You ain't s**t without your homeboys
You ain't s**t without your homeboys
You ain't s**t without your homeboys
Now
Now everytime I see you cats is rollin in packs
For the life of me I cannot see why you don't know how to act
Love to clown when you deep, but when you on that solo creep
out on the streets you don't hear a peep
ni**a it's a god damn shame, somebody explain 
why they sent a Bad Boy to play a grown man's game
Tear that a*s out the frame, completely get that a*s kicked
Woke up on the street but you'll be sleepin in the casket
How long will it last, ni**a don't ask, just be first to blast
Outlaw on the mash tryin to be the first to see some cash
My s**t's cla*sic, like my ni**a Nate 
Go get the tape, we keep the nation anticipatin until we break
Money made me evil, court cases got me stressed
ni**az aimin at my head but I still wear my vest
I don't give a f**k motherf**kers I'm loc
They all duckin when my gun smoke
cause you ain't s**t without your homeboys
You probably run at the sound of funk
I give a f**k, you ni**az is punks
Without your homeboys, you be the first to reach in your trunk
You scary ni**az is punks, you ain't s**t without your homeboys
ni**a, punk a*s motherf**ker
You ain't s**t without your homeboys
Throw your hands up you little trick, coward motherf**ker
[Young Noble]
Like Yak said, how the f**k you gonna shoot me rocks
When you got the Outlaw 'Pac s**ttin ya box
You was lookin real weak walkin down the street
Now a ni**a thirty deep, oh you wanna beef
Talk cheap, shoot a ni**a the fair one
Your homies like f**k it, what's this you the only scared one
(faggot a*s) Damn son, close call I bet
Now down around the way you gets no respect
They like that Outlaw ni**a played you out
We could have took it to the firfth I would I have laid you out
ni**az be actin all different when they dogs come around
Watch em act like bi**hes when Outlawz draw down
They all clown, better yet they all stunned 
You the type to have a gun and never blazed it once
Get y'all banana split, you ain't Emmanuel
Outlawz you'll never forget
Makaveli the Don get a call y'all
Turnin these streets into Vietnam
Where your homeboys, homeboy
[2Pac]
You ain't s**t without your homeboys
My thug ni**az, I love ni**az
From small time crooks to big-time drug dealers
My homeboys, the only thing a ni**a got left
I love my ni**az to death, we ain't s**t without our homeboys
.. You know what time it is
I ain't s**t without my homeboys
Hey, tell em the story how you came up ni**a
Now I was born alone, took my first joint and I got high alone
Now I'm an Outlaw ni**a, I never die alone
Me and my ni**az is so close, it's complicated
One ni**a smokin and drinkin, and yet we all faded
My ni**a Edi had a son we all happy
Cause now that little ridah got to deal with eight daddies
My ni**az cry, we all cry, and all ride
To rectify the problem, motherf**kers they all die
Been tryin to make a million, by hustlin since my adolescense
From crack dealin to rap villian, my new profession
Who wanna see me at eight deep, f**k 3D
You coward a*s motherf**kers'll never see me
Bustin with automatic straps, my raw raps like good crack
ni**az fiendin, I got em comin back
Until I die, they label me as a ridah
Forever, my ni**az be together
Ain't s**t without your homeboys
Thug ni**az I love ni**az
From small time crooks to big-time drug dealers
Without your homeboys, the only thing a ni**a got left
I love my ni**az to death
We ain't s**t without our homeboys
(without our homeboys)
Love my ni**az to death
We ain't s**t without our homeboys
Love you ni**az to death

Yeah nigga
2Pac in this muthafucka
[Tupac]
All my homies drinking liquor
Tears in everybody's eyes 
Niggas cried to mourn a homies homicide
But I can't cry 
instead I'm just a shoulder
Damn, why they take another soldier
I load my clip before my eyes blurry, don't worry
I'll get them suckas back before your buried (shit)
Retaliate and pull a 187 
do real niggas get to go to heaven ?
How long will they mourn me, bury me a muthafuckin 'G'
Bitch don't wanna die 
then don't fuck with me
It's kinda hard to be optimistic 
When your homies lying dead on the pavement twisted
Y'all don't hear me doe, I'm trying hard to make amends
But I'm losing all my muthafuckin friends (damn) 
They should've shot me when I was born
Now I'm trapped in the muthafuckin' storm
How long will they mourn me ?
[Chorus]
I wish it would have been another
How long will they mourn me
How long will they mourn my brother
(Got them niggas all dead and shit)
How long will they mourn me
I wish it would have been another

How long will they mourn me
How long will they mourn my brother
(Gotta keep this shit goin' on, Yo Syke)
[Syke]
How long will they mourn me
Every muthafuckin' day homie
You stayed down when tha other niggas didn't know me
From my heart to the trigga you my fuckin' nigga
And things won't be the same without ya nigga
I remember kickin' back, you wanted to lack
And goin' half on a muthafuckin' hundred sack
Smokin' blunt after blunt and steady drinkin'
Hung around so much, you knew what I was thinkin'
Tell me Lord, why you take big Kato ?
So confused not knowing which way to go
I'm goin crazy and runnin' out of fuckin' time
I can't take it, I'm losin' my fuckin' mind
So day after day 
ride after ride
We'll hook up on the other side
Watch over your family and your newborn
Till we meet again homie
How long will they mourn me ?
[Chorus]
I wish it would have been another
(Yo Kato)
How long will they mourn me
(It's still on nigga)
How long will they mourn my brother
How long will they mourn me
I wish it would have been another
(Yeah)
How long will they mourn me
How long will they mourn my brother
(Rated R, Double Jeopardy, Mack 10)
[Rated R]
Damn a nigga tired of feeling sad
I'm tired of putting in work
I'm tired of cryin while watching my homies leave the earth
I know soon one day I'll be in the dirt
And my peoples'll be mournin'
When they get a call from the coroner
All niggas can say is that's fucked up
And get tossed up
Reminiscing how we grew up (my nigga)
Rest and love to my nigga Kato
See you in the crossroads real soon
For now let me pour out some brew
I'll be always thinkin' of ya homie
Rest in peace
How long will they mourn me ?
Ya know life's a fuckin' trip
And everybody gotta go
But why the fuck it have to be my nigga Kato
Another nigga fell victim to the chrome
It's enough to make you crazy
It's fuckin' with my dome
Ya only live once on this earth
A nigga had it bad, since the day of my mutahfuckin' birth
But niggas say they down and they always be my homie
But when a nigga gone
How long will ya mourn me ?
[Chorus]
Yeah!
I wish it would have been another
(Mack 10 in this muthafucka)
Yeah, how long will ya mourn me
How long will ya mourn my bother
(Thug Life boy, Nate blowin' that shit, 
Nate Dogg do that shit nigga)
I wish it would have been another
Yeah! How long will ya mourn me
How long will ya mourn my brother
(This for my nigga Kato and all his kids)
How long will ya mourn me
I wish it would have been another
How long will ya mourn my brother

I Ain't Mad At Cha 
(feat. Danny Boy)
Change, shit
I guess change is good for any of us
Whatever it take for any of y'all niggaz to get up out the hood
Shit, I'm wit cha, I ain't mad at cha
Got nuttin but love for ya, do your thing boy
Yeah, all the homies that I ain't talk to in a while
I'ma send this one out for y'all, knahmean?
Cause I ain't mad at cha
Heard y'all tearin up shit out there, kickin up dust
[Danny Boy]
 I ain't...
Givin a motherfucker, heheheheheh
Yeah, niggaz
[Danny Boy]
 ...mad at cha
Cause I ain't mad at cha
[Verse One: 2Pac]
Now we was once two niggaz of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line 
You was just a little smaller but you still roller
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
Member when you had a jheri curl didn't quite learn
On the block, witcha glock, trippin off sherm
Collect calls to the till, sayin how ya changed
Oh you a Muslim now, no more dope game
Heard you might be comin home, just got bail
Wanna go to the Mosque, don't wanna chase tail
I seems I lost my little homie he's a changed man
Hit the pen and now no sinnin is the game plan
When I talk about money all you see is the struggle
When I tell you I'm livin large you tell me it's trouble
Congratulation on the weddin, I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life, and that's no bullshitin
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
And I can see us after school, we'd BOMB
on the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed, and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme, and you ain't even with it
Hmm, knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker bad
Go toe to toe when it's time for roll you got a brother's back
And I can't even trip, cause I'm just laughin at cha
You tryin hard to maintain, then go head
cause I ain't mad at cha
(Hmm, I ain't mad at cha)
[Chorus: Danny Boy]
I ain't, mad, at cha 
[2Pac:]
 (I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad, at cha
[Verse Two: 2Pac]
We used to be like distant cousins, fightin, playin dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin, knowin, that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin blitzed and I reminsce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin n grindin wasn't nothin on our mind
In time we learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back, to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony lovin the way the guns blow
And even though we seperated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I be locked up state
I kiss my Mama goodbye, and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear, cause Mama I ain't happy here
I'm through trial, no more smiles, for a couple years
They got me goin mad, I'm knockin busters on they backs
in my cell, thinkin, "Hell, I know one day I'll be back"
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'll be there, so prepare, to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin at cha
Cause youse a down ass bitch, and I ain't mad at cha
[Chorus: Danny Boy]
I ain't, mad, at cha 
[2Pac:]
 (I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad, at cha 
[2Pac:]
 (A true down ass bitch, and I ain't mad at cha)
[Verse Three: 2Pac]
Well guess who's movin up, this nigga's ballin now
Bitches be callin to get it, hookers keep fallin down
He went from nuttin to lots, ten carots to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big, man on the block
He's Mister local celebrity, addicted to move a key
Most hated by enemy, escape in the Luxury
See, first you was our nigga but you made it, so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you why you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin so high off that bomb hopin we make it, to the better days
Cause crime pays, and in time, you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
You'll feel the fire from the niggaz in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a glock beside my head, when will it stop?
Til God return me to my essence
Cause even as a adolescents, I refuse to be a convalescent
So many questions, and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?
They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin at cha
You niggaz just don't know, but I ain't mad at cha
[Chorus: Danny Boy]
I ain't, mad at cha 
[2Pac:]
 (and I ain't mad at cha)
Iiiiiiiii ain't mad 
[2Pac:]
 (hell nah I ain't mad at cha) at cha
I ain't, mad at mha

 (and I ain't mad at cha)
I ain't, mad at cha

I Don't Give A Fuck 
I don't give a fuck
They done push me to the limit the more I live
I might blow up any minute, did it again
Now I'm in the back of the paddy wagon
While this cops bragging about the nigga he's jackin
I see no justice 
All I see is niggas dying fast
The sound of a gun blast
Then watch the hurst past
Just another day in the life 'G'
Gotta step lightly cuz cops tried to snippe me
The catch, they don't wanna stop at the brother man
But then they'll have an accident and pick up another man
I went to the bank to cash my cheque
I get more respect from the mutha-fuckin' dope man
The Grammy's and the American music shows pimp us like hoes
They got dough but they hate us though
You better keep your mind on the real shit
And fuck trying to get with these crooked ass hypocrites
They way they see it, we was meant to be keep down
Just can't understand why we getting respect now
Mama told me they're be days like this
But I'm pissed cause it stays like this
And now they trying to send me off to Kuwait
Gimme a break
How much shit can a nigga take
I ain't goin' nowhere no how
What you wanna throw down
Better bring your guns pal
Cuz this is the day we make 'em pay
Fuck bailin' hate I bail and spray with my A-K
And even if they shoot me down
There'll be another nigga bigger
from the mutha-fuckin' underground
So step but you better step quick
Cause the clocks goin' tick and I'm sick of the bullshit
You're watching the makings of a physco-path
The truth didn't last
Before the wrath and aftermath
Who's that behind the trigger?
Who'd do yah figure!?
A mutha-fuckin night nigga
Ready to buck and rip shit up
I had enough and I don't give a fuck
Niggas!, isn't just the blacks 
also a gang of mutha-fuckas dressed in blue slacks
They say niggas hang in packs and their attitude is shitty
Tell me, who's the biggest gang of niggas in the city
They say niggas like to do niggas, 
Throw me in the cuffs with just two niggas
A street walkin' nigga and a beat walkin' nigga with a badge
I had to shoot yah and the pass for the blast take his cash
And bash his head in dump him at the dead in
And that's just his luck
Cause a nigga like me 
don't really give a fuck
Walked in the store what's everybody staring at
They act like they never seen a mutha fucker wearing black
Following a nigga and shit
Ain't this a bitch
All I wanted was some chips
I wanna take my business else where
But where?
Cause who in the hell cares
About a black man with a black need
They wanna jack me like some kind of crack fiend
I wonder if knows that my income is more than 
His pension, salary and then some 
Your daughter is my number one fan
And your trife ass wife wants a life with a black man
So who's the mac in fact who's the black jack
Sit back and get fat off the fat cat
while he thinks that he's getting over
I bust a move as smooth as casanova
And count another quick meal
I'm getting paid for my traid but its still real
And if you look between the lines you'll find a rhyme
AS strong as a fuckin' nine
Mail stacked up niggas wanna act up
Let's put the gats up and throw your backs up
But the cops getting dropped by the gun shot
Usta come but he's done, now we run the block
To my brothers stay strong keep yah heads up
They know we fed up
But we they just don't give a fuck
They just don't give a fuck
I gotta give my fuck offs
Fuck you to the San FranCisco police department
Fuck you to the Marin County Sheriff department
Fuck you to the F.B.I
Fuck you to the C.I.A
Fuck you to the B-u-s-h
Fuck you to the AmeriKKKa
Fuck you to all you redneck prejudice mutha fuckas
And fuck yah
Fuck Y'all
Punk gay sensitive little dick bastards
2paclypse mutha fuckin' know 
Y'all can kiss my ass and suck my dick
And my uncle Tommy's balls
Fuck Y'all
Punks, punks, punks, punks, punks

If I Die 2Nite 
A coward dies a thousand deaths
A soldier dies but once
[Verse One]
They say pussy and paper is poetry power and pistols
Plottin on murderin motherfuckers 'fore they get you
Picturin pitiful punk niggaz coppin pleas
Puffin weed as I position myself to clock G's
My enemies scatter in suicidal situations
Never to witness the wicked shit that they was facin
Pockets is packed with presidents, pursue your riches
Evadin the playa hatin tricks, while hittin switches
Bitches is bad-mouth, cause brawlin motherfuckers is bold
But y'all some hoes, the game should be sewed
I'm sick of psychotic society somebody save me
Addicted to drama so even mama couldn't raise me
Even the preacher and all my teachers couldn't reach me
I run in the streets and puffin weed wit my peeps
I'm duckin the cop, I hit the weed as I'm clutchin my glock
Niggaz is hot when I hit the block, what if I die tonight
[Chorus]
If I die tonight 
[repeat 3X]
"Tonight's the night I get in some shit" - 
[Dr. Dre]
[Verse Two]
Polishin pistols prepare for battle pass the pump
When I get to poppin niggaz is droppin then they done
Callin the coroner come collect the fuckin corpse
He got it by killer, preoccuppied with bein boss
Revenge is the method, whenever steppin keep a weapon close
Adversaries are overdosed over deadly notes
Jealous niggaz and broke bitches equal packed jails
Hit the block and fill your pockets makin crack sales
Picture perfection pursuin paper with a passion
Visions of prisons for all the pussies that I blasted
Runnin with criminals individuals with no remorse
Try to stop me my pistol posse's usin deadly force
In my brain all I can think about is fame
The police know my name, a different game, ain't a thing changed
I'm seein cemetary photos of my peers
Conversatin like they still here, if I die tonight
[Chorus]
[Verse Three]
Pussy and paper is poetry power and pistols
Plottin on murderin motherfuckers 'fore they get you
Pray to the heavens three-fifty-sevens to the sky
And I hope I'm forgiven for Thug Livin when I die
I wonder if heaven got a ghetto for Thug niggaz
A stress free life and a spot for drug dealers
Pissin while practicin how to pimp and be a playa
Overdose of a dick, while drinkin liquor when I lay her
Pistol whippin these simps, for bein petrified and lame
Disrespectin the game, prayin for punishment and pain
Goin insane, never die, live eternal, who shall I fear?
Don't shed a tear for me nigga I ain't happy hear
I hope they bury me and send me to my rest
Headlines readin MURDERED TO DEATH, my last breath
Take a look picture a crook on his last stand
Motherfuckers don't understand, if I die tonight
[Chorus]
<BREAK>

If My Homie Calls 
[Verse One:]
Ever since you was a pee-wee, down by my knee with a wee-wee
We been coochie-coo all through school, you and me G
Back in the days we played practical jokes on
everybody smoked with they locs and the yolks on
All through high school, girls by the dozens
Sayin we cousins, knowin that we wasn't
But like the old saying goes
Times goes on, and everybody grows
Grew apart, had to part, went our own ways
You chose the dope gaaaane, my microphone pays
In many ways we were paid in the old days
So far away from the crazies with AK's
And though I been around clowning with the Underground
I'm still down with my homies from the hometown
And if you need, need anything at all
I drop it all for y'all, if my homies call
[Verse Two:]
It's a shame, you chose the dope game
Now you slang cane on the streets with no name
It was plain that your aim was mo' cane
You got game now you run with no shame
I chose rappin tracks to make stacks
In fact I travel the map with raps that spray cats
But now I don't wanna down my homie
No matter how low you go you're not lowly
And I, hear that you made a few enemies
But when you need a friend you can depend on me, call
If you need my assistance there'll be no resistance
I'll be there in an instant
Who am I to judge another brother, only on his cover
I'd be no different than the other
H-to-the-O-to-the-M-to-the-I-to-the-E
I'm down to the E-N-D
Cause it's a fall in no time at all
I'm down for y'all, when my homies call
Word, if my homies call
[Verse Three:]
Well it's ninety-one and I'm livin kinda swell now
But I hear that you're going through some hell pal
But life makin records ain't easy
It ain't what I expected it's hectic it's sleazy
But I guess that the streets is harder
Trying to survive in the life of a young godfather
My homies is making it elsewhere
Striving, working nine to five with no health care
We both had dreams of being great
But his deferred, and blurred and changed in shaped
It's fate, it wasn't my choice to make
To be great, I'm giving it all it takes
Trying to shake, the crates and fakes and snakes
I gotta take, my place or fall from grace
The foolish way, the pace is quick and great
Smiling face, to hide the trace of heat
But my homie would never do me wrong
That's why I wrote this song, if you ever need me it's on
No matter who the foe they must fall
Us against them all I'm down to brawl if my homies call
<BREAK>

I'm Gettin Money 
Get money nigga
Yeah - aw yeah
Dedicate this one to all the hustlers
that get up every motherfuckin mornin and put they work in
I see you - I see you boy
I'm up before sunrise first to hit the block
Lil' bad motherfucker with a pocket full of rocks
Learned to throw them thangs, get my skinny lil' ass kicked
Niggaz laughed, til the first motherfucker got blas-ted
I put the nigga in his casket
and now they covering the bastard in plastic
I smoke blunts on the regular fuck when it counts
Tryin to make a million dollars out a quarter ounce
Gettin ghost on the five-oh, fuck them hoes
Got a forty-five screamin out surviv-al
Hey nigga can I lay low, cook some ya-yo
and holla five-oj when I say so
Don't wanna go to the pen, I'm hittin fences
NARC's on a nigga back missin me by inches
And they say how do you survive, weighin one-fifty-five
in the city where the little niggaz die
Tell mama don't cry, cause even if they kill me
They can never take the life of a real G
I'm gettin money 
[4x]
Still on parole and I'm the first nigga servin
Pour some liquor on the curb, for my homies that deserve it
If I wanna make a million, gotta stay dealin
Kinda boomin round the way, think today I make a killin
Dressin down like I'm dirty, but only on the block
just a clever disguise, to keep me runnin from the cops
Gettin high I think I'll die if I don't get no ends
I'm in a bucket but I'm ridin it like it's a Benz
I hit the strip I let my music buck
drinkin liquor and I'm lookin for a bitch to fuck
Rather die makin money, than live poor and legal
as I slang another ounce, I wish it was a kilo
I need money in a major way
Time to fuck my girl, she gettin paid today, ha hah ha
I live Thug Life and let the money come to me
Cause they can never take the game from a young G
I'm gettin money 
[4X]
Damned if I don't, and damned if a nigga do
Now watch a young motherfucker pull the trigger too
RAISE UP, and don't let them see ya cry
Dry your eyes, young nigga time for do or die
I pack a pistol in my pocket, ready on my Glock
Ain't no time for a nigga to even cock shit
I done seen a motherfucker peep pain
at point blank range cause he slept on the game
Ain't a damn thing changed, they shakin the dice
Now roll em if you can't stand pain better hold em
Cause ain't no tellin what ya might roll
You might fold catch AIDS from a slight cold
You better live ya life to the fullest
Be quick to kill a bull got a pistol motherfucker better pull it
And even if they kill me
They can never take the life of a young G
I'm gettin money

I'm Losin It 
(feat. Big Syke, Spice 1)
Straight out the motherfucking bay
Here we go
[2Pac]
Lord help me, save me, Mama keep praying
For a young motherfucker trying to duck an early grave
In the city where ya can't tell the snakes from the fakes
Fakes from the phonies, enemies of homies
Around the corner there's another nigga waiting to jack
He don't know I got a glock 'til his ass get shot
Like a motherfucking thug disease
Craving beats like they motherfucking drugs to me, hey
What's up with bitches trying to screw me? Do me cause I did a movie
Throw the pussy to me but before they never knew me
Rather die then let ya play me for a, buster
And with my glock I'm a plotting ass rotten motherfucker, huh
Don't let the movie fool ya, let me school ya
Screaming Thug Life nigga when I do ya
I'm going crazy, getting dizzy
And then I suffacate a motherfucking breather bring me back
I'm telling ya I'm losing it
[Chorus]
Said I'm losing my mind
Losing my mind
[ X4 ]
[Big Syke]
I'm going crazy, niggas can't fade me
On the real I kill when I step to ya fucking grill
So let me kick it let me flip it let me get wicked
I'm not a buster from the hood selling whooped tickets
I hang with G's flipping keys and smoking weed
I get the cash and dash and never learn to read
So fuck a bitch fuck a hoe and I let ya know
Because they come and go like the wind blows
What am I giving how I'm living what I'm giving up
You can take my life and I don't give a fuck
Cause I'm the trouble most coming from the west coast
Where the niggas is banging 'til the overdose
Killers and murderers, psychos and lunatics
Nobody knows what makes my mind click
Is it the demons, screaming inside of me?
Hell no it's just the Thug Life mentallity
I'm going crazy shit don't phase me
I'm living like a thug 'til six niggas carry me
Death is on the trigga so pull it
I can't take it no more, nigga, I'm losing it
[Chorus]
[Spice 1]
Shit was talking to me, my gat screamed fire
The bullet told me shoot that motherfucker he's a lier
I talked to me 3-80 like a bitch on a stroll
When my niggas try to ????
Nigga, I can't get fucked in this game I'm a psychopath
My AK told me to shove him up some niggas ass
I'm having long conversations with Mr. Millometer
He's one of my best friends bitch ass nigga eater
And Miss Mossburg love it in the back trunk
You know that old school bitch she like to get it funked
And spitting motherfuckers by the seems
My grand daddy Mr. AR-15
By the evil motherfucker
Talked me into taking over a dope turf and shooting cluckers
Said he was my only family
Shoot straight, and please don't jam me
Got in a fight at the club my gat started talking
Told me to shut the fuck up and let him do the talking
I woke up and it was sick to see the guts hang
I'm going nuts man
Shit was talking to me

IntroBomb First (My Second Reply) 
Suge Shot Me
[church bells ring in background]
In today's music news: the ever controversial Tupac Shakur has
just released another album under the alias Makaveli.
Music insiders are running wild trying to rearrange other artist
street dates, in fear of a wipeout in retail interchart movement.
Although no one knows the exact cause of the new album;
resources tell me a number of less fortunate rappers
have joined together in conspiracy to assassinate the character
of not only Mr. Shakur, but of Death Row Records as well.
Nas, the alleged ring leader of it, is furious at Tupac
excuse me Makaveli's verbal assault
on Mobb Sleep, Notorius P.I.G., and several other New York rappers
Jay-Z, from "Hawaiian Sophie" fame, Big Little whatever
and several other corny sounding motherfuckers
are understandably shaken up by this release.
The question everbody wants to know is -- 
why'd they get this nigga started?
Tupac, rather Makaveli, was not available for comment
but released this statement:
[Makaveli]
It's not about East or West
It's about niggaz and bitches, power and money, 
riders and punks.  Which side are you on?
[gun cocked, six shots, bullets hit ground]
These niggaz is still fuckin talkin?
You niggaz still breathin?  Fuckin roaches, aight
Aight, it's the Raid for your cockroaches
(All day, everyday)
It's the raid for you punk motherfuckers
(The pump in yo' ass)
This is it nigga!  Killuminati style
(Outlaw lifestyle)
Makaveli the Don, solo shit - bring it!
[Makaveli]
Allow me to introduce first {*gunshot fires*} Makaveli the Don
Hysterical, spiritual lyrics like the holy Qu'Ran
Niggaz get shook like 5-0
My forty-five gun's next to me when we ride, for survival
Money makin plans, pistol close at hand, swollen pockets
Let me introduce the topic, then we drop it
Expose snakes cause they breath freely, see me ride?
Located world wide like the art of graffiti
I think I'm tougher than Nitti, my attitude is shitty
Born on a dopefiend's titty.. huh
In every city you'll find me
Look for trouble right behind me
My Outlaw niggaz down to die for me, knahmean?
I hit the scene niggaz duckin from my guillotine stare
I'm right there; my every word, a fuckin nightmare
Get me high, let me see the sun rise and fall
This for my dogs down to die for yours
Extreme venom, no mercy when we all up in 'em
Cut 'em down.. to Hell is where we send 'em
My whole team, trained to explode ride or die
Murder motherfuckers lyrically, and I'm not gon' cry
Me - a born leader never leave the block without my heater
Two big pits, I call them my bitch nigga eaters
And not a whimper 'til I'm gone
Thug Life runnin through my veins so I'm strong
(Ha ha ha)
Bye bye bye, let's get high and ride
Oh, how do we do these niggaz but I'm not gon' cry
I'm a Bad Boy killa, Jay-Z die too 
Lookin out for Mobb Deep, nigga when I find you
Weak motherfuckers don't deserve to breathe
How many niggaz down to die for me?  Yeahh-yeayy!
West coast ridah, comin right behind ya
Should've never fucked wit meeee
I want money hoes sex and weeeed
I wont rest till my road dawgs freeee, bomb first!
[Chorus]
We, bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider 'fo you die
We ain't even come to hurt nobody tonight
But it's my life or yo' life, and I'ma bomb first
We, bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider 'fo you die
We ain't even come to fight tonight
But it's my life or yo' life, and I'ma bomb first
[E.D.I. Amin]
For so many days and some many ways we've been duckin strays
They delivers, but we still some Bad Boy killers
Got nuttin to lose, I gots no where to go
I only got one home, see me stranded on Death Row
With Outlawz, it's Makaveli, be the general
And I be a soldier on a mission
Sent to do, what you'll never do
and that's ride for the cause
Yes I'll die for the cause
Ya best believe if I'ma leave this bitch
Yo I'm dyin with yours
Kamikaze, sicker than a muh'fuckin Nazi
Got a little question  for that nigga that made "Paparazzi"
If you ain't in this rap game, for the motherfuckin cash mayne
then what is your motherfuckin purpose?  None can serve us
E.D.I. Amin born worthless
That's until the day, I decided to bomb first BEATCH!!
[Young Noble]
Your style wack as ever, like you was rockin patent leather
Causin massive terror, y'all niggaz lack, you ain't thorough
Half rapper half drug kingpin
Yer tellin fairy tales dunn
"King of New York," like you the motherfuckin one?
But I'm from Jerz and we don't play that shit
From the Claire down to Newark Bricks, all my niggaz flippin chips
Gettin rich, even though it's hard
Tryin to creep through these halls and brawls
without scarred by a revolv'
with no warnin signs, cause yo my man took five
Now I'm the young one with the nine, ready to put in my time
[Makaveli]
Shoot first, look at they head burst bleedin
Don't want to hear no shit this evenin, believe me
We, bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider 'fo you die
G's, and thug niggaz on the rise
Plan-plot-strategize, and bomb first
We, bomb first when we ride
Please, reconsider 'fo you die
G's, and thug niggaz on the rise
Plan-plot-strategize, and bomb first

[Reporter]
Good Evening 
[sirens in the background]
I'm reporting live from Sunset Boulevard 
Where many excited fans have gathered with candles 
[crowd starts chanting "Tupac"]
Awaiting the much anticipated release, of Tupac Shakur's latest album, Better Dayz 
This is yet another post-humorous release by Tupac 
Which, raises the question 
Where are these songs coming from? 
It's interesting how, the message in these songs 
Is still relevant today 
Even in his death, he's touching people with his lyrics 
I can feel the energy in the air, as they count down to midnight 
When the album will officially be released 
Oh, hold on, I, think they're starting to countdown now 
[Crowd]

It Ain't Easy 
Keepin it real
[Verse One: 2Pac]
I take a shot of Henessey now I'm strong enough to face the madness
Nickel bag full of sess weed laced with hash
Phone calls from my niggaz on the, other side
Two childhood friends just died, I couldn't cry
A damn shame, when will we ever change
And what remains from a twelve gauge to the brain
Arguements with my Boo is true
I spend mo' time with my niggaz than I do with you
But everywhere it's the same thang, that's the game
I'll be damned if a thang changed, fuck the fame
I'll be hustling to make a mill-ion, lord knows
Ain't no love for us ghetto children, so we cold
Rag top slowin down, time to stop for gas
Beep my horn for a hoochie with a proper ass, uhh
It ain't easy, that's my motto
Drinkin Tanqueray straight out the bottle
Everybody wanna know if I'm insane
My baby mama gotta mind full of silly games
And all the drama got me stressin like I'm hopeless, I can't cope
Me and the homies smokin roaches, cause we broke
Late night hangin out til the sunrise gettin high
Watchin the cops roll by
It ain't easy... that's right
[Chorus: 2Pac]
It ain't easy, being me
Will I see the penitentiary, or will I stay free
[repeat 3X]
[Verse Two: 2Pac]
I can't sleep niggaz plottin on to kill me while I'm dreamin
Wake up sweaty and screamin, cause I can hear them suckers schemin
Probably paranoid, problem is, them punks be fantasizin
A brother bite the bullet, open fire and I died
I wonder why this the way it is, even now
Lookin out for these killer kids, cause they wild
Bill Clinton can you recognize a nigga representin
Doin twenty to life in San Quentin
Gettin calls from my nigga Mike Tyson, ain't nuttin nice
Yo 'Pac, do something righteous witcha life
And even thou you innocent you still a nigga, so they figure
Rather have you behind bars than triggers
But I'm hold ya down and holla Thug Life, lickin shots
Til I see my niggaz free on the block
But no it ain't easy, hahahah
Til I see my niggaz free, on the block, oh
It ain't easy
[Chorus 2.75]
[Verse Three: 2Pac]
Lately been reminiscin
bout Peppermint Schnapps in Junior High hit the block
Keep an eye on the cops while D-Boys slang rocks
It's the project kid without a conscience, I'm havin dreams
of hearin screams at my concerts, me all my childhood peers
through the years tryin to stack a little green
I was only seventeen, when I started servin fiends
And I wish there was another way to stack a dollar
So my apoli', casue these hard times make me wanna holler
Will I live to see tommorrow, am I fallin off?
I hit the weed and then proceed to say fuck all of y'all
Ain't nobody down with me I'm thuggin, I can't go home
Cause muh-fuckers think I'm buggin, so now I'm in
this high powered cell at the county jail
Punk judge got a grudge, can't post no bail, what
do I do in these county blues
Gettin battered and bruised by the you know who
And these fakes get to shakin when they face me
Snakes ain't got enough nuts to replace me
Sittin in this, livin hell, listenin to niggaz yell
Tryin to torture em to tell, I'm gettin mail
But ain't nobody sayin much, the same old nuts
is makin bucks while these sluts is gettin fucked
They violated my probation, and it seems
I'll be goin on a long vacation, meanwhile
It ain't easy
No it ain't easy

I'll take your hand gladly, anything ya need ask me

[2PAC]
You alveate tha stress spend time with you, I feel blessed
When you gone feel tha pain so strong deep in my chest
When i got arrested, came so close to goin to jail
throwin blows at tha po pos breakin they nails
screamin loud goin all out
Damn I did
You stayed locked down at moms house
watchin tha kids, thru tha whole bid
In tha V-I  I seen ya daily
When my fake homies try ta fuck you, you run and tell me
that's why I stay commited, I thank God everytime I hit it
hopin you'll forgive me for the times I bullshitted
Me and you against the world
we untouchable, screamin like ya dyin everytime I'am fuckin you

no need to fear so much insanity 
and thru tha years
I know ya gave me your heart and plus
When I'am dirt broke and fucked up Ya still love me
[Chours]
(An Outlaw)
Boo would ya die for me?
Down holdin my pistol, gettin high
with mean sounds tougher than brisles

and sometime daddy ready to wine ya and dilain

(Another Outlaw)
Gettin high between tha sheets
Make tha shit right here discrete
Puttin nikies on ya belly while we fuckin on tha beach
I love it when ya nut up and grab me
I feel for ya badly, baby girl just like daddy
(A 3rd Outlaw)
Shorty I lend my hand out ta help ya
loss soul lookin for shelta, on tha late night accept ya

My age is young
out of place bitch days is done
From a trixy to a missy

Placed her under my wing
Showed her how we swing
Now she rollin blunts for her king
1 day labled thug Mrs
tha essance of my ghetto sistas
hugs and kisses
that's just for me to be a father figure

Killuminati 
[2Pac]
Let it be prophesized; ni**az'll die because ya crew's goon
Around the way ni**az get murdered by the full moon
Heard it in whispered tones
ni**az is bold and they choose to roll
I kill em all, watch now ni**a truth be told
Westside was the war cry, look how they scatter
ni**az dyin by my 30-yard, brains'll splatter
Wonder why these ni**az cross me
I'm certified crazy, so sick the world made me
Now diggy-die, everytime I ride it's for reasons
Hard to kill a ni**a cause I'm comin back like Jesus
Bow down to my ill nation runnin from drug cases
Lookin at my congregation so full of thug faces
Momma gave a ni**a breath, a life of stress
I invest in a vest and makin ni**az watch they every step
Label me a threat
and I ain't even got started with this s**t yet
Thug style baby, hands on my pistol, listen I'm a ridah
Every ni**a breathin pay attention
Bout to show you motherf**kers how it feel, to drop a body
The simple gun to my lifestyle, Killuminati
[Chorus: Kastro + 2Pac]
[Kas]
 Yo Makaveli they can't stop you
[Pac]
 Hold it down
[Kas]
 Killuminati and we got you, got you
Yo Makaveli they can't stop you
[Pac]
 Hold it down
[Kas]
 Killuminati and we got you, got you
Yo Makaveli they can't stop you
[Pac]
 Hold it down

After the fire comes the rain, after pleasure there's pain
Even though we broke for the moment, we'll be ballin again
Til I make it yo; my military be prepared for them bustaz
Similar to, bi**hes that scary, get too near me we rushin
Visions of over-packed prisons, fiends and ni**az thug livin
Pressures and three strikes, I hope they don't test us
They pull the heater ammunition it cranks, psssh
Move without a sound, as we slide down, pistols in place
They got me fiendin for currency, the money be callin
It's like I'm - dreamin, see in season me ballin
Participated in felonious behavior
Cock the cocked fo'-five, snatchin ni**az pagers
Labeled a mark soon as we start, it was hard to quit
We started out drinkin 40's, moved to harder s**t
God damn now I'm a grown man, I follow no man
ni**a got my own plan, and it's called Killuminati
[Chorus (w/ minor variations)]
[E.D.I. Amin]
I spend most of my time bankin ni**az
because they hate a ni**a, comin across fake ni**az
But we made ni**az, old school and I'm thinkin
Y'all some bi**h made ni**az and you steadily sinkin
O-U-T, L-A-W-Z ain't nuttin f**kin with that
We bustin back comin back for the stacks
Laugh last cash cash, all I want is the paper
Givin them f**kers tool whips, I rule haters
Y'all can't fade us, we kill steal and peal quickly
The boss ni**az, definitely, put it down strictly
E.D.I. Amin, until the law come for me
Kill em all for shortie, ninety-nine Killuminati
[Kadafi]
They got me thinkin strugglin and hustling's my only fate
Toppin grams on the kichen plate, tryin to keep that money straight
Times is rollin three up these streets sleep
But when I crack, hammer cocked back rapped in my sheets
My life's been crossed, crooked since a seed it hurts
Got a package from the devil, payin my deeds
Preocuppied by the greed, in this crooked life I lead
More funds to spend, or bigger guns to squeeze
Me and my thugs clock G's simpin naughty thangs
Real as these tatt's on my body, and it's Killuminati
[Chorus]
[2Pac]
Makaveli the Don until I'm gone, I maintain
Hold it down, hold it down
Makaveli up in this bi**h, worldwide mash, Westside
Makaveli the Don until I'm gone, I maintain
The question we ask, do you know what time it is?
Hold it down, hold it down
You know what type of s**t we be
Makaveli the Don until I'm gone, I maintain

Hold it down, hold it down

[2Pac]
Last year was a hard one, but life goes on
Hold my head against the wall learnin right from wrong
They say my ghetto intrumental, detrimental to kids
As if they can't see the misery in which they live
Blame me, for the outcome, ban my records - check it
Don't have to bump this but please respect it
I took a minus and now the hard times are behind us
Turned into a plus, now they stuck livin blinded
Hennesey got me feelin bad, time to stop drinkin
Rollin, in my drop-top Jag, what's that cops thinkin?
Sittin in my car, watch the stars and smoke
I came a long way but still I got so far to go
Dear mama, don't worry; I'ma watch for snakes
Tell Setchu, that I love her, but it's hard to take
I got the letter that she sent me, and I cried for weeks
This what came out when I tried to speak - all I heard was
[Chorus - repeat 2X]
(One, two, three, four)
[2Pac]
I see bloods and crips runnin up the hill
Lookin for a better wayyyyyy..
My brothers and sisters it's time to bail
cause even thug niggaz prayyyyyy..
Hopin God hear me, I entered the game; look how much I changed
I'm no longer innocent - casualties of fame
Made a lot of money, seen a lot of places
And I swear I seen a peaceful smile on my mama's face
when I gave her the keys to her own house, this your land
Your only son done became a man
Watchin time fly; I love my people do or die
But I wonder why, we scared to let each other fly
June 1-6, '7-1, the day
mama pushed me out her womb, told me, "Nigga get paid."
No one can understand me - the black sheep
Outcasted from my family, now packin heat
I run the streets, a young runaway, live for today
When he died, I could hear him say, c'mon..
[Chorus - repeat 2X]
[Bad Ass]
God help me out here, cause I'm posessed
I need the root of all evil for my stress
Cause money's like a stong prescription drug, it's got me addicted
to the pleasure and the pain it inflicted
Somethin bout the paper wit the pictures of the president's, head
Damn, it's like a motherfuckin plague that spread
It's epidemic; forgotten, forgotten it got worse
I keep my head on straight, makin money cause it's cursed
Makin money makes a difference day by day so I gotta stay
paid, no doubt, day in and day out
This life is like a vicious cycle called fightin to live
No matter how hard you try, it's in death, you gotta die
A lot of my, peers didn't make it to the years to come
Did life doin right, or did life livin dumb
Who has the answers?  I wonder; I turn to my elders
They aged and experienced, but they can't even tell ya
or tell me, that there'll be light at the end of the road
(Why?) Cause they don't even know
A million thangs run through my mind..
You ain't gotta be in jail to be doin time..
[Chorus - repeat 2X]
[Chorus repeats while Tupac speaks below]
[2Pac]
I feel fucked up in this bitch.
I smoked half a ounce to the head
Chocolate tye, indo, Hawaiian, lambsbread, buddha, all that shit
I'm fucked up in this motherfucker, and Hennesey don't help

Makaveli the Don puttin it down to the fullest, maximum overload

Can't nobody stop us when we blunted up and swervin
Packed in a suburban, screamin outlaw runin on the curb
They never try me cause right behind me your killer team
I get a word cut the head off a nigga like a guillotine
This Hennessey'll keep me calm though
Sittin in the back of the club, tradin convo
Livin like a Don in my own mind
Signal Kadafi, nigga watch me with the chrome nine
All the time drinkin champagne
Walk through the crowd let the tramps hang
Niggas playa hate but do a damn thing
Picture me doin eighty down a one way
Stuck in the trunk, caught with gun play
So I gotta keep my eyes open
Gettin high, wonder why we gotta die smokin
My alibi, I'm victory
Like them other vile men I'm marked for death
Spendin my nights like its the last one left
I'm an outlaw
[Chorus]
Am I wrong, I wanna get it goin on
Last to leave, till I see everybodys gone
I'm at the bar you can catch me hands full of liquor
Puffin on a sweet swisher I'm the last one left
Tell me am I wrong, I wanna get it goin on
Last to leave until I see everybodys gone
I'm at the bar you can catch me hands full of liquor
Puffin on a sweet swisher, guess I'm the last one left
[Kastro]

Gat chillin by my balls
Prior to war is rider nigga only five six tall
Napoleon only knows on we outlaws fuck fear

Thug passion all up in me
Feelin like I took some Henne
It aint easy I'm tryin to make a dollar out of two pennies
What we got with these rap niggas
Wanna pull they're gat niggas
Only got my side cause they think pac die nigga
Last niggas with our tape
Take a shot within our vest
Pac come and catch weight
Nigga we the last ones left

If we woulda known the zone inside my own dome
Fresh outs jail it was hell but I'm probably home
Lookin for niggas that was roofin that shit when I was locked back
Hands on the pump, makem jump when its cocked back
Fuckem all they're bitches inside a world of weak
Bitch niggas be afraid to speak
We the last ones left
[2Pac]
[Chorus (slight change)]
Tell me am I wrong, I wanna get it goin on
Last to leave, till I see everybodys gone
At the bar you can catch me hands full of liquor
Puffin on a sweet swisher Like I'm the last one left
Am I wrong, I wanna get it goin on
Last to leave till I see everybodys gone
At the bar you can catch me hands full of liquor
Puffin on a sweet swisher, last one left
Am I wrong, I wanna get it goin on
Last to leave till I see everybodys gone
At the bar you can catch me hands full of liquor (Yeah)
Puffin on a sweet swisher, I'm the last one left

I eat and sleep the worst shit, turfs and birth
Me and my team super supreme putin in work

And I call earl screamin fuck the world

And wify even wanna know if she gonna see me tonight
And i know it aint right, but its the life I got

Cause the punk police ain't learned shit yet
You mutha-fuckas gonna pay the price
Can't make a Black life, don't take a Black life
It's on, the next real nigga fall dead
Dred, jheri curl, process, or bald head
Be prepared for the smoke to bust
What niggas need to do is start loc'in up
United we stand divided we fall
They can shoot one nigga
But they can't take us alll 
Let's get along with the Mexicans
And we can all have peace on the sets again
Imagine that if it took place 
[ha ha ha]
Keeping the smile off their white fakes
I ain't racist but lets trade places
Trace the hate 'n face it 
One nigga teach two niggas

And them niggas teach more niggas
And when we blast 
That'll be the biggest blast you've heard
And them is my last wordz

Late Night

[DJ Quik]
Hey 'Pac, it's yo' boy
Hey man so far I've been listenin to your album
and I ain't heard nuttin you could kick back and smoke a beadie to
You know?
Yeah like that
Some of that mellow shit
Some of that shit that make bitches drink
Make niggaz think
And help you check a fat-ass bank, hahahah
So why don't you kick some of that shit, nigga only you know how
Hahahah, feel me?
[2Pac]
I'm barely standin, and plus my secondhand say it's midnight
Some Alize and Cristal guaranteed to get right
Like misdemeanors is a small thang
With DJ Quik in this bitch, I let my balls hang
Runnin through the street lights, cause we like, yo nigga
get your mobb on show em what a G like
Around the corner it's like Vegas, or better yet like Reno
Niggaz poppin, welcome to our casino, cause you and me know
hundred percent like a c-note
Lookin for a bitch that's half-black and filipino
And when I meet her I'ma offer her some indo
Tounge-kissin on the window of a pearl white limo
Don't wanna be your man, I'm your nigga
Touch me here, I'll get bigger
While I'm diggin I'll get deep into your liver
I'm game type
Love fuckin bitches in the same night
My words are aphrodisiacs if you say em right
The club be poppin so I'm stoppin at the Fat Burger
Look through the paper it's another black crack murder
The city's full of surprises, you can live or you can die
You can fuck on the first night, or try, in the late night
[DJ Quik cuts and scratches this sequence 2X]
"Last night.. last night changed it all"

 In the late night!
"Last night.."
"I don't give a fuck, where you gon'.. be"

 In the late night!
[Hussein Fatal]
Around my way we lamp, many styles get cramped
I clock rocks in the rain til my socks is damp
Ain't NUTTIN like bein a thug when I can just
sit on the Row of Death straight knowin that I'm blessed
Hussein Fatal, flawless fatality
Overdosin on crime, three steps from reality
Get up to get down, represent your town, last night
was poppin like like cocked glocks with hollow-tip rounds
[Kastro]
From bootycalls to bail sheets, it ain't no tellin
if I wake up in the county in my jail sheets
My intuitions and ambitions up in the late night 
probably involves me comin up with just to see another day
Might be me who bites the bullet
In these streets where a man journey
With crooked cops and a society who tryin to burn me
I'm like a pit in a cage, spittin my shells in a gauge
Deadly as AIDS, niggaz gettin crossed like a maze
Now picture me livin my life like a king, maybe one day
Until then I'm livin Monday through Sunday
Bringin the gunplay for all these beefs and battles
When we collide, I'm a ride on that hide like cattle
Cowards best to skedaddle in the late night
[DJ Quik cuts and scratches this sequence 2X]
"Last night.. last night changed it all" 
"Last night.."
"I don't give a fuck, where you gon'.. be"

Money and multiple gunshots are shown, large amps are blown
Niggaz in low-lows, pursuin mo' hoes, then go home
The life of a California star, and when you see me
in the drop-top Jag', how many niggaz wanna be me?
Game is automatic, manditory I sell
To Live or Die, I survive, but with a story to tell
Cause when you gettin some riches, watch for dumb bitches
They have you labelled a rapist before you get to tongue-kissin
It's a mean world nigga you strapped, or be a throwaway
Will I survive the late night, to see dawn of day?
Nobody knows me, I'm a shadow
My army fatigues made for battle, pockets full of ammo
Cause when I'm out in the streets, I'm on point, where the static?
Too many done died from semis, so now we automatic
I dissapear whenever heated, ride whenever needed
for my niggaz up in Clentin gettin weeded
Continue to roll until I'm old, ride until I die
Supply long as you motherfuckers buy
My homies rolled by in a bucket, but they ain't short and duckin
Slappin niggaz known for tellin bitches FUCK-IT in the late night
[DJ Quik cuts and scratches this sequence]
"Last night.. last night changed it all"

Letter 2 My Unborn 
To my unborn child..
To my unborn child.. in case I don't make it
Just remember daddy loves you
[talking in background]
To my unborn child..
To my unborn..
[2Pac]
Now ever since my birth, I've been cursed since I'm born to wild
in case I never get to holla at my unborn child
Many things learned in prison, blessed and still livin
Tryin to earn every penny that I'm gettin, and reminiscin
to the beginnin of my mission
When I was conceived, and came to be in this position
My momma was a Panther loud, single parent but she proud
when she witnessed baby boy rip a crowd
To school, but I dropped out, and left the house
Cause my mama say I'm good for nothin, so I'm out
Since I only got one life to live, God forgive me for my sins
Let me make it and I'll never steal again, or deal again
My only friend is my misery
Wantin revenge for the agony they did to me
See my life ain't promised but it'll sure get better
Hope you understand my love letter, to my unborn child
[Chorus: sung, with 2Pac ad libs]
I'm writing you a letter
This is to my unborn child
Wanna let you know I love you
Love you, if you didn't know I feel this way
How I, think about you every day
I have so much to say
[2Pac]
Seems so complicated to escape fate
And you can never understand 'til we trade places
Tell the world I feel guilty to bein anxious
Ain't no way in hell, that I could ever be rapist
It's hard to face this, cold world on a good day
When will they let the little kids in the hood play?
I got shot five times but I'm still breathin
Livin proof there's a God if you need a reason
Can I believe in my own fate
Will I raise my kids in the right, or the wrong way?
Dear mama I'm a man now
I wanna make it on my own, not a handout
Make way for a whirlwind prophesized
I wanna go in peace.. when I gotta die
On these cold streets, ain't no love, no mercy, and no friends
In case you never see my face again
To my unborn child
[Chorus]
[2Pac]
Dear Lord can you hear me, tell me what to say
to my unborn seed in, case I pass away
Will my child get to feel love
Or are we all just cursed to be street thugs?  Cause bein black hurts
And even worse if you speak first
Livin my life as an Outlaw, what could be worse?
Cause maybe if I tried to change
Who I'm kiddin?  I'ma thug 'til I die, I'ma rider mayne
Touch bases, eat lunch at plush places
Regular criminal oasis awaits us
If there's a ghetto for true thugs, I'll see you there
And I'm sorry for not bein there
Just know your daddy was a soldier, me against the world
Bless the boys, and all my little girls
To the Lord I'm eternal, restin in peace
Please take care of all my seeds, to my unborn child
[Chorus - repeat to fade]
[2Pac over Chorus]
To my unborn child.. please take of all my kids
My unborn child.. to my unborn child
This letter goes out to.. to the seeds that I might not get to see
cause of this lifestyle
Just know that your daddy loves you, got nuttin but love for you
All I wanted was for you have a better life than I did
That's why I was out here on a twenty-four hour 365 grind
When you get to be my age you'll understand
Just know I got love for you
And I'll see you up there in the ghetto heaven
Cause ghetto heaven gotta be there.. haha, take care
Run wild, but be smart
Follow the rules of the game
I know that sometimes it's confusin
The rules of the game is gonna get you through it, all day everyday
Watch out for these snakes and fakes, friends comin down the way..

Letter To The President 
Uhh.. dear Mr. President
Whas happenin?
I'm writin you because, s**t is still real f**ked up in my neighborhood
Pretty much the same way, right around the time when you got elected
Ain't nothin changed
All the promises you made, before you got elected..
.. they ain't came true
[2Pac]
Tell me what to do, these ni**az actin up in the hood
Send mo' troops, dear Mr. President
(Me and my homies is wonderin what's goin on.. holla!)
Tell me what to do, these ni**az actin up in the hood
Send mo' troops..
Why should I lie, when I can dramatize?
ni**az fell victim to my lyrics, now traumatized
Simply by spittin I've been blessed given riches, enemies suspicious
cause I'm seldom in the company of bi**hes
Plus the concepts I depict, so visual, that you can kiss
each and every trick or bi**h, inside the s**t I kick
My heaviest verse'll move a mountain
Casualties in ma*s amounts, brothers keep countin
f**k the friendships, I ride alone
Destination Death Row, finally found a home
Plus all my homies wanna die, call it euthanasia
Dear Lord, look how sick this ghetto made us, sincerely
yours I'm a thug, the product of a broken home
Everybody's doped up, ni**a what you smokin on?
Figure if we high they can train us
but then America f**ked up and blamed up
I guess it's cause we black that we targets
My only fear is God, I spit that hard s**t
In case you don't know, I let my pump go
Get ?ride for M'Thulu? like I ride for Geronimo
Down to die, for everything I represent
Meant every word, in my letter to the President
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These ni**az actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
(What should I do?)
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These ni**az actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
[Kastro]
Oh youse a ball in the White House, I hope you comfortable
cause yo I spend my nights out, with the lights out
under the safety of darkness, amongst the crazed and the heartless
and young soul bros, ready to rode a starship
Launch it, leave a ni**a flat for scratch, the Godless
I gotta get chips, but you can't understand that
Wanna ban rap? Stand back, before you get hurt
It's the only thing makin pay besides smoke and work
On a mission listen more chips my goal and position
First on my decision I realized the same ni**a
Trippin to drastic measures tryin to get stacks of cheddar
Muh'f**kers hate cops, wait it ain't gettin better
But you keep, tellin us, that it is
while your motherf**kin troops keep killin our kids, dig
Don't be surprised if you see us
Dumpin with nuttin but artillery to free us, motherf**ker
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These ni**az actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These ni**az actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
[Edi Amin]
Strapped and angry, with no hope and heartbroke
Fightin first my trained brain until it's not so
It's hostile, ni**az lick shots to watch the glocks glow
Cadres of coppers patrol us like we some animals
And it ain't no peace, my peace a piece on my streets
to people beefin and things, squeakin on they beefs for weeks
Mr. President, it's evident, nobody really care
for a struggle out the gutter, twenty-two with gray hair
I was raised to raise hell, frail and my heart stale
So I'ma bring hell to earth until my heart fail
But y'all play fair, give me and mine, I'll share
Til y'all show us you care, it's gon' be mayhem out here
Me and these 223'sll freeze the biggest with ease
I'm still a ni**a you fear, bring the beast to his knees
and I've been born to represent, for that I've been heaven sent
And I meant, every word, in my letter, to the President
s**t is still f**ked up y'all
And y'all wonder when it's gon' get better
and it ain't gon' get better
[2Pac]
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These ni**az actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These ni**az actin up..
Heavenly Father may I holla at you briefly
I wanna meet the President, but will he meet me?
He's scared to look inside the eyes of a Thug ni**a
We tired of bein scapegoats for this capitalistic drug dealin
How hypocritical is Liberty?
That blind bi**h ain't never did s**t for me
My history, full of casket and scars
My own black nation at war, whole family behind bars
And they wonder why we scarred, thirteen lookin hard
Sister had a baby as an adolescent, where was God?
Somewhere in the middle of my mind
is a ni**a on the tightrope, screamin let him die
Can't lie I'm a thug, drownin in my own blood
Lookin for the reason that my momma's strung out on drugs
Down to die, for everything I represent
Meant every word, in my letter to the President
[Big Syke]
Blacks is broke, think it's a joke that we livin low?
Y'all sniffin blow and postin what they hittin fo'?
Tell the secretary it's necessary we get paid
Look what you made, little kids gettin sprayed
Day after day, and night after night
Battles and wars to the daylight
We might change and rearrange if you do somethin
Til then we gonna keep it comin, Mr. President
Hehe
And I meant every word in my letter to the President
[2Pac]
Word motherf**kin life
f**k this ni**a think?Cuttin taxes, takin off welfare
We 'sposed to just sit here, go broke and die, starvin?
Motherf**kers crazier than a motherf**kin ??
ni**a this Thug Life, Westside Outlaw Immortalz ni**a
We fin' to hustle til we come up
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These ni**az actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These ni**az actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These ni**az actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. President, tell me what to do
These ni**az actin up in the hood, send mo' troops
Dear Mr. Clinton, s**t
It's gettin harder and harder for a motherf**ker
to make a dollar in these here streets
I mean s**t, I hear you screamin peace
But we can't find peace
til my little ni**az on these streets get a piece
I know you feel me cause you too near me not to hear me
So why don't you help a ni**a out?Sayin you cuttin welfare
That got us ni**az on the street, thinkin who in the hell care?
s**t, y'all want us to put down our glocks and our rocks
but y'all ain't ready to give us no motherf**kin dollars
What happened to our 40 acres and a mule fool?
We ain't stupid
Think you got us lookin to lose
Tryin to turn all us young ni**az into troops
You want us to fight your war
What the f**k I'm fightin for?
s**t, I ain't got no love here
I ain't had a check all year
Taxin, all the blacks and
police beatin me in the streets
f**k peace
These ni**az actin up in the hood, send mo' troops

Lie To Kick It 
(feat. Richie Rich)
(If she didn't wanna fuck then she never would've called you) 
[Repeated]
Yeah I dedicate this to my nigga Mike Tyson.
It's all good.
[Chorus]
You ain't got to lie to kick it
To them tricks and them bitches
Out to get a nigga's riches
[Repeat]
[Verse 1: Richie Rich]
Jack of all trades ballin' like Jordan you punk
fake inside the paint in fact I know you can't
do half of the shit that you was claimin' in the county
Suckas on yo jock you claim you run the block
Polyurethane busta cracked in half
you claim you folding bank but I know yo bank stank
I lived around the corner I seen you fully smoked
Must I say some more you weighed a buck 04
you sold ya TV for a buck cause it was way too late
Now they sent you upstate and you done gained some weight
You's a baller lying to them youngstas quick
got them thinking you sick and representing yo click
But you's an old basehead kickin' too much hype
yo bicentennial pipe it got rally stripes
And if they knew yo identity
you'd probably be the victim of a sticking (ugh ugh)
You ain't got to lie to kick it.
[Chorus 4x]
[Verse 2: 2Pac]
You ain't got to lie to kick it
y'all don't hear me
I got these niggas yackin' in my face
about some shit that never took place
And what you see is what you get
that's what he told me
I peeped it in his pose
exposed the fucking phony
I'm gettin' richer so they claim to be my homie
with them bitches they be freaky
they don't know me
Hey it's gettin drastic
Gunnin niggas down cause they plastic
Sleep on a G and get that ass kicked
and stuffed in a casket
Rippin' the shit like it's my muthafucking last hit
Hey they wonder why a nigga's nothin' nice
and everytime I bust a nut I fuck for Tyson
Cause I know the real on the bitch
she got to skit ya just to get a nigga's riches (fuck that bitch)
I pray to God that the bitch don't get no dick
and got a nigga screamin' Fuck That Bitch!
[Chorus]
[Verse 3: Pac 
&
 Rich]
Well if a bitch'll be a bitch
Then a trick'll be a trick
I've got my nigga Richie Rich and we be all up in the mix
this is Thug Life baby rollin' hoes like Vogues
Stay the fuck up out of mine
and I'll stay out of yours
It's a Oakland thang and bitch you wouldn't understand
This Tanqueray got me screamin' Fuck yo' man.
But now you beefing on the strength
that you was thinkin' I was jocking
Hey bitch I got no time for hoes I'm steady clockin'
and if it ain't about a buck I gives a fuck
it's raggedy hoes like you that keep a nigga stuck
so what's up with them low life bitches tryin' to play me
Bitch you better see Trojan about yo' baby (Ha ha)
Trickin' niggas better catch up on they pimpin'
Cause bitches love to catch a nigga when they slipping

How many brothas fell victim to tha streetz
Rest in peace young nigga, there's a Heaven for a 'G'
be a lie, If I told ya that I never thought of death

but life goes on.....
[Verse One:]
As I bail through tha empty halls
breath stinkin' 
in my jaws
ring, ring, ring
quiet y'all
incoming call
plus this my homie from high school
he's getting bye
It's time to bury another brotha nobody cry
life as a baller
alchol and booty calls
we usta do them as adolecents
do you recall?
raised as G's
loc'ed out and blazed the weed
get on tha roof 
let's get smoked out
and blaze with me
2 in tha morning
and we still high assed out
screamin' 'thug till I die'
before I passed out
but now that your gone
i'm in tha zone
thinkin'
'I don't wanna die all alone'
but now ya gone
and all I got left are stinkin' memories
I love them niggas to death
i'm drinkin' Hennessy
while tryin' ta make it last
I drank a 5th for that ass
when you passed....
cause life goes on
[Chorus]
[Verse Two:]
Yeah nigga
I got tha word as hell
ya blew trial and tha judge gave you

plus with tha drama
we're lookin out for your babies mama
taken risks, while keepin' cheap tricks from gettin on her...
life in tha hood...
is all good for nobody
remember gamin' on dumb hoties at chill parties
Me and you 
No true a two
while scheming on hits
and gettin tricks 
that maybe we can slide into 
but now you burried
rest nigga
cause I ain't worried
eyes bluried
sayin' goodbye at the cemetary
tho' memories fade
I got your name tated on my arm
so we both ball till' my dying days
before I say goodbye
Kato and Mental rest in peace
Thug till I die
[Chorus]
[Verse Three:]
Bury me smilin'
with G's in my pocket
have a party at my funeral
let every rapper rock it
let tha hoes that I usta know
from way before
kiss me from my head to my toe
give me a paper and a pen
so I can write about my life of sin
a couple bottles of Gin
incase I don't get in
tell all my people i'm a Ridah
nobody cries when we die
we outlaws
let me ride
until I get free
I live my life in tha fast lane
got police chasen me
to my niggas from old blocks 
from old crews
niggas that guided me through 
back in tha old school
pour out some liquor
have a toast for tha homies
see we both gotta die
but ya chose to go before me
and brothas miss ya while your gone
you left your nigga on his own
how long we mourn
life goes on...
[Chorus repeats to end]
[sung overtop repeating chorus]
Life goes on homie
gone on, cause they passed away
Niggas doin' life
Niggas doin' 50 and 60 years and shit
I feel ya nigga, trust me

You know what I mean

life goes on....
and we up out this bitch

Life Of An Outlaw 
In the life we live as thugs,
Everbody fuckin wit us so can't you see
It's hard to be a man.
Ridin wit my gun in hand.
Why explain the game? Niggas ain't listenin.
Stuck in positions. If victims can't stand the heat,
Then stay the fuck out the kitchen.
Have these bustas switchin, lookin at me mean.
Itchin, givin suckas plenty space.
Have these bitch niggas snitchin.
Where are we now? Guns found daily.
The feds surely hope that they could finally nail me for sellin dope.
They backwards, make tracks burst whenever I rap.
Attack. Words bein known to explode on contact.
Extreme at times. Blinded by my passion and fury.
Look at me laugh at my competition's flashin my jewelry.
You'd stay silent if you niggas knew me. Truely effective.
The shit you heard ain't do me justice. Got a death wish, bitch.
Run up, face me and trace wit an infared beam.
It seems niggas ain't recognize my team.
Ain't nobody holdin you back. Explode the track to confetti.
Unload it. Cuz niggas ain't ready. The life of an outlaw.
[Chorus repeats]
Code 3. Attack formation. Pull out your pistols.
Keep an eye out for the devils cuz they itchin to get you.
Mercy to this madman screamin kamikaze in tongue.
Automatic gunfire makin all my enemies run.
Who should I call when I'm shot and bleedin.
Indeed the possibility has part a chase in cream.
Dope got me hatin fiends. Scheam wit my team, just a chosen few.
My foes victim of explosives. Come closer. Exhale the fumes.
We got memories fadin fast. A slave for cash.
Accelerate, mash, blast, then dash.
Don't look now. How you like it, raw.
Niggas ain't ready for the wrath of the outlaws. Never surrender.
Death is for a son to stay free. I'm thugged out.
Fuck the world cuz this is how they made me.
Scarred but still breathin.
Believe in me and you could see the victory.
A warrior with jewels. Can you picture me?
Life of and outlaw.
[Chorus repeats]
City under siege. It's like I can't even breathe.
I'm from the state of car theives. G, deep from the street.
Plenty beef. I play for keeps, arrange the whole crime scene.
Mobb Deep. This nigga from behind tryin to creep.
No halfs wit no straps, jack.
It's on to bounce back.
And an ounce so fat, they snatch my style ?
Get this grip wit hollows to get cha.
Snip wit clippers. Get the picture?
I wrote my life down like a scripture.
And I'm still on lost in the land of the lonely.
Where ain't nobody holy. A matter of a fact, we unholy.
Everybody livin soley for themselves. Too hostile on a land hell.
Somebody need me. You know we lost hope and we needin it.
Wit the evil it's forever. But it might be low down, scandalouz
Like a tramp is. All for the street fame on how to be managed.
To plan shit. 6 months in advaced to what we plotted.
Approved to go on swole and now I got it.
Un uh, crack my window. Knowin they'd love to catch Kastro sleepin.
Attach a strap under my pillow and a hand like we freakin.
Creepin deep into morning. Peepin out the weak.
While they yawnin and let my cloud speak for it's self.
No doubt. Outlaw. Outta my mind, outta time. You're all blind.
Some kind of life of mine Kato don't mind.
Findin it funny, matter of fact, cuz it is.
Perhaps finally I look at that true over the years as an outlaw.
Eh, Noble.
What's up nigga.
Would you die for me, nigga?
Hell yeah.
Would you kill for me?
On my grandmother, nigga.
Ah yo.
What's up.
Let's ride on them stupid bitches right now.
Watch out.
Well now they all say they roaches and parasites.
Snakes and all they might
Thug Life break night.
Drink till we fist fight.
Life or death. But you can't win with a vest.
But there won't be no breathing for the reason
Punk bitch on your breath.
I see day is dark and I admit it's dark.
So chase ?
Beware foolin marks.
And yo, Makaveli, give me them bullets that was left for PO's belly.
And let me bust back to them niggas till they all sweaty.

Here's a story bout my lil' homies, straight thuggin
Lil' bad young mothafuckers, gotta love him
You catch him in his G ride, touchin his glock
Screamin Outlaw (Wessyde motherfucker) bustin on my enemy's block
Educated on these cold streets
Gettin money makin dummies out the police, ain't no peace
for an adolescent nigga to rap, so be a thinker
Bud smokin twenty-four seven, everyday drinker
Got my diploma but I never learned shit in school
Mo' money, mo' bitches, mo' murder fool
Always the young niggaz gettin in shit
She wouldn't stop to conversate so you called her a bitch (BIATCH)
Bustin on paper thin motherfuckers
Drinkin gin 'fore youu get to sinnin on them busters
Emptied his clip, passed by like he didn't know me
Everybody duckin, my fuckin lil' homies
[Chorus: repeat 2X]
Lil' homies on the ride
Niggaz gonna die tonight, let's get high tonight
(my lil' homies)
Lil' homies on the mash
Runnin from these punk police, cause lil' niggaz run the sreets
(my fuckin lil' homies)
[2Pac]
I remember.. when you was just a lil' G
Flirting with death, playin Russian Roulette, screamin KILL ME!
Hey there young nigga, what you smokin on?
Mad at the world cause you came from a broken home
Love to squad plus your mob is sick
A bunch of adolescent niggaz spittin major shit
Tell me, young nigga if ya die let me know
Would your heart feel pain, watchin as your mother cries?
Will all your homies ride?
Or will they all get high, and talk about how you died?
Young niggaz on a mission to compete
Gettin G's, packin heat, bringin havoc to the fuckin streets
Nobody knows why he took a fo'-fo'
and loaded up on the whole front row (BUCK BUCK, BUCK BUCK!!)
Try to tell him but he act like he don't know me
Pull out his pistol and show me, my lil' homie
[Chorus]
[2Pac - over Chorus]
Hahaha, whassup nigga?  YEAH!
You lil' bad motherfuckers
You motherfuckers know what time it is
Yeah nigga!
Juvenile delinquent-ass motherfuckers
Under eighteen.. better protect that shit!
[2Pac]
First to bomb, sixteen on death row
Bustin on them phony motherfuckers cause the big homey said so
Niggaz knew I was a nut case, quick to blast
Livin underage, but he'll blaze on yo' bitch ass
Is there a heaven for a G?
And if it is, will I finally get to be at peace?
On these streets ain't no peace, shell-shocked souls
makin money off of crack sales, young black males
Unable to change cause it's a cycle
Plus nobody knows.. the evil that they might do
Lil' Moo, Big Yak, K. Kastro
Big mouth Hussein, call them Outlawz
Tellin the world to be equipped
When these young motherfuckers rip shit, they don't quit
Drew down on me, pull a pound on me
Bust like he didn't know me, my lil' homies
[Chorus]
[2Pac - over Chorus]
Whassup nigga let's do this shit!  My lil' homies!
Lil' bad-ass motherfuckin adolescent niggaz!  My lil' homies!

Lord Knows 
[2Pac]
Damn, another funeral, another motherfucker
Lord knows
['Pac is choking on blunt smoke]
Lord knows
[coughing harder]
Lord knows
[one final cough]
I smoke a blunt to take the pain out
And if I wasn't high, I'd probably try to blow my brains out
I'm hopeless, they shoulda killed me as a baby
And now they got me trapped in the storm, I'm goin crazy
Forgive me; they wanna see me in my casket
and if I don't blast I'll be the victim of them bastards
I'm loosin hope, they got me stressin, can the Lord forgive me
Got the spirit of a thug in me
Another sip of that drink, this Hennesey got me queasy
Don't wanna earl, young nigga take it easy
Picture your dreams on a triple beam, and it seems
don't underestimate the power of a fiend
To my homies on the block
slangin rocks with your glocks put this tape in your box
When you're runnin from the cops -- and never look back
If they could be black, then they would switch
Open fire on them busta-ass bitches, and Lord knows...
(Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
Lord knows
[coughing again]
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
The Lord knows
[still coughing]
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
The Lord knows
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
I wonder if the Lord will forgive me or bury me a G
I couldn't let my adversaries worry me
and every single day it's a test, wear a bulletproof vest
and still a nigga stressin over death
If I could choose when a nigga die, figure I'd
take a puff on the blunt, and let my trigga fly
When everyday it's another death, with every breath,
it's a constant threat, so watch yo' step!
You could be next if you want to, who do you run to?
Murderin niggaz, look what it's come to
My memories bring me misery, and life is hard 
in the ghetto, it's insanity, I can't breath
Got me thinkin, what do Hell got?
Cause I done suffered so much, I'm feelin shell-shocked
And driveby's an everyday thang
I done lost too many homies to this motherfuckin game
and Lord knows...
(Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
Lord knows
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
Lord knows!
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
The Lord knows
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
One-time!  One-time!
Fuck the five-oh cause they after me
Kill me if they could, I'll never let em capture me
Done lost too many niggaz to this gangbangin
Homies died in my arms, with his brains hangin, fucked up!
I had to tell him it was alright, and that's a lie
and he knew it when he shook and died, my God
Even though I know I'm wrong man
Hennesey make a nigga think he strong, man (heh heh)
I can't sleep, so I stay up, don't wanna fuck them bitches
Try to calm me down, I ain't givin up
I'm gettin lost in the weed, man, gettin high
Livin everday, like I'm gon' die (gon' die, gon' die)
I smoke a blunt to take the pain out, and if I wasn't high
probably try to blow my brains out
Lord knows...
(Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
Lord knows!
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
Lord knows.. Jesus..
(He knows! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
(He is listening! Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)
(Lord knows.. Lord knows.. he he.. he.. he.. heeee...)
(Lord knows, Lord knows, Lord knows!)

Loyal To The Game (DJ Quik Remix) 
(feat. Big Syke)
[2Pac]
Now I've got to ask, on a nigga's ass, tell me will they blast me?
I think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me
Now, it's gettin crazy after dark, these NARC's
be like tryin to shut me down but I'm too smart
Now picture me scared of the penitentiary
I've been movin these things since the days of elementary
Now tell me what you need when you see me
I'm stackin G's, buyin all the things on TV, believe me
I got some killers on my payroll, and they know
When it's time to handle business, nigga lay low
Although I'm young, I'm still comin up
I'm gettin paid, pullin razors on niggaz when they runnin up
The first to pull a strap when there's drama - busta you ain't heard?
I've been slicin motherfuckers since I lost my mama
There ain't a cop that can stop me
My posse is cock D, and they don't quit until they drop me
I'm loyal to the game
[Chorus]
{"Prince of peace must hear our plea"}
{"Told life you'd be back"} {"There you were"}
{"Prince of peace must hear our plea"}
{"Everybody look around"} {"There is no hope"}
{"Prince of peace must hear our plea"}
{"Brothers we better get hip"}
[Big Syke]
My mama say I'm crazy cause I'm all about the hood
I can't get my shit together but I'm on leather and wood
And the hood is all I know, patrol and circle the block
Off the curb and niggaz swerve, serve a smoker a rock
And I'm hot like fish grease and nigga so is my Caddy
And I'm steady catchin static, move the traffic to the alley
Out in Cali niggaz rally others all for the soil
Mix the work with bakin soda and get the water to boil
OH NO can't no busters hang, I hope you feel me mayne
Cause snitches bitches and they ain't been loyal to the game
My niggaz feel my pain, when sunshine turn to rain
You know these buster motherfuckers came to fuck the game
And it's a shame I see the mark in they eyes
When they yellin that he tellin get to me, no surprise, nigga
[Chorus]
{"And come off this trip"}
[DJ Quik]
Loyalty, undeservedly, never heard of me
I, be the exception, the epitome of adaption
The superficial surroundings, bullets fiends cockhounds and
enemies in my family extortin schemin and scammin me (pop pop)
I'm like loose rollin, I'm growin until the diesel hit me
I'm badder than bruised, and madder havin to choose
'tween happiness and the blues, and who be fillin my shoes
when I done had it with crews, ecstatic to see me lose
But panic when I be smooth, I'm manic but I'm no fool
Y'all rappin I'm talkin cool, and Columbine is not new
In Compton they shoot up schools too, ridin by to see who's who
Cock the shotty they cruise through, rock the body blood ooze through
Tell his family that dude's blue, no comin back
from him scrappin when niggaz was packin and he wasn't packin too
So if you feel me you know when they try to kill me they slow
I seen from 'round the corner with mirrors and creeped up on 'em
[Chorus - 5/6ths]
{"Thugs throw like wine down a nigga's throat
if this shit don't STOP STOP STOP STOP STOP!"}

If you know what I know then you know I ain't playin
(I'm loyal to the game)
Nigga get in my way and I'll blow out your brain
[Verse 2: Young Buck]
Possessed by the streets you can't tell me that this ain't home
I can't eat if the rest of this shit ain't gone
I'm gettin used to the needles on the bathroom sink
Gotta close my door because the bathroom stink
See, daddy don't work, and mama don't drink
But daddy do dope, and mama can't think
So look like I'ma be the man of the house
Gotta have somethin to put in the air when it's out
Up early in the mornin the first to get it
They say if you really want it then come on wit it
Sacrifice my life for this ice and these cars
And I only spent 30 days behind bars
I ain't never had a job but my rent got paid
I handled any beef that they sent my way
So send me to the pen but you know I won't change
It's thug in my veins
I'm loyal to the game
[CHORUS: 50 Cent]
I do my thing respect my hustle I ain't playin
(Nigga I'm loyal to the game)
You get in my way and I cock and pop that thing
(Man I'm loyal to the game)
If you know what I know then you know I ain't playin
(I'm loyal to the game)
Nigga get in my way and I'll blow out your brain
[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
Yeah
It ain't my fault I came up fast
And your the name niggas bring up last
And all the dames get a king up ass
10 grand on every ring I flash
Deep frog--and I'ma have to fling your ass
I'm on the block where its scorchin hot
If you get caught in the crossfire they have to throw you off the block
I get 'dro by the pickle jar
These broke niggas wanna get the star
So I don't keep the four-nickel far
My lips is zipped I'm loyal to the game
Bring your bitch around me I'm spoilin her brain
Get more slugs to boil in your frame
Cause you got rocks and they got aluminum foil for a chain
The paints the same color as oil in the Range
I'm stingy ain't got nothin for you but some change
I'm good now but the fact still remains
That the struggle that I'm from is attached to my name
[CHORUS: 50 Cent]
I do my thing respect my hustle I ain't playin
(Nigga I'm loyal to the game)
You get in my way and I cock and pop that thing
(Man I'm loyal to the game)
If you know what I know then you know I ain't playin
(I'm loyal to the game)
Nigga get in my way and I'll blow out your brain

Mama's Just A Little Girl 
Young mothers 
That's right 
I feel ya (hey) 
I know how it is 
(MAMA's JUST A LIL' GIRL) 
Don't nobody understand 
I feel ya 
[Verse 1: Tupac]
She was .. 
Born A heavy set girl with pig tails and curls 
A heart full of gold 
Still it won't change the world 
Though she could never understand why 
Some underhanded plans, witnessed a man die 
Was only 15 
Should have been a beauty queen 
Still see here crying by the caskets when here parents got killed 
Little girl don't cry 
'Coz even though they died 
You can best believe they watching over thee from the sky 
Never asked for this misery 
But look at what you gettin' 
It's a blessing in disguise 
When you find out your pregnant 
No money, no home 
And even though you all alone 
You'se got to do this on your own 
So baby go on 
I wish you luck 
And if you need me, call 
Just come to me and let me feed you all 
I can understand 
The way it feels when you fighting the world 
Facing all this drama 
When mama's just A little girl 
[Chorus]
Mama 
Don't know why 
Mama's just a little girl 
Given that she's a ??
Time ain't on her side 
Mama's just a little girl 
(Mama's just a little girl) 
She gotta hold her head up high 
[Verse 2: Tupac]
At 16 what a beautiful thing 
The very essence of a jet black ebony queen 
And who could tell she would get pregnant at an early age 
She didn't listen, had sex 
Watch her belly raise (hey) 
Got violated by someone she dated 
If this is fate I hate to see the seed she created 
So we wait, though it takes time to build the body and the mind 
She reclines 9 months 
Then finally its time 
What do we find? 
A little grown boy a mind with a tortured soul 
Addicted to a life of crime at no time of the growing stage 
He learned his values on the streets at an early age 
Watch for police 
Don't come home (why) 
'Coz mammas acting crazy 
At the hospital 
'Bout to have another baby 
Like the rose from concrete 
Grown within 
Blessed with twins 
How the hell can mamma raise 3 men 
So we began a closest family 
Such insanity 
A happy home 
For one act inhumanity 
Plus mammas said the seed was corrupted 
Used the rubber belly 
Begging us to breathe if she love us 
Now mamma sits quiet 
Sipping peppermint schnapps 
Turned the house into a spot and made her watch for cops (hey) 
How could mamma bring a thug like me into this world? 
She ain't the cause of all the drama 
Cause mommas just a little girl 
[Chorus]
Mama 
Don't know why 
Mama's just a little girl 
Liven if she is or not 
Time ain't on her side 
Cause ama's just a little girl 
(Mama's just a little girl) 
She gotta hold her head up high 
(How could she raise us) 
[Verse 3: Tupac]
Now 
Would she remain in the same spot? 
The gunshots rang, they came from the cane spot 
Now look here 
I see her clutching her son 
In her arms she hurt 
Her heart bleeding as she watched her seed die in the dirt 
Fulfill prophecy 
But who could stop the grief? 
I walk around trying to hold the world up on top me 
Probably be an innocent man 
But still I'm the victim of a curse 
What could be worse? 
Nothing but pain 
Since my birth, taught me functions at the pen 
Cause everybody's in paying back society 
I'm guilty of a life of sin 
I watched the drama occur 
My eyes blurred 'fore I jet it 
I wonder why we all have to die for we get it 
Though we shed tears 
So many peers I done buried 
Worried and scared 
Knowing I'ma see the cemetery 
Must be prepared in this cold world 
No-one cares 
No it ain't fair 
But we all there 
And do our share 
In this land of underhanded schemes and plans 
Vivid dreams of a nigga having g's in hand 
Mamma told me not to be a punk 
Fuck what you talking about coward 
What you niggas want? 
(hey) 
They ain't a thing I wouldn't do for my mamma in this world 
Cause you know I ain't mad at cha 
You' just a little girl 
See mammas just a little girl 
(hey hey) 
[Chorus]
[Repeat until fade]
Mama 
don't know why 
Mama's just a little girl 
Given that she is or not 
time ain't on here side 
mama's just a little girl 
(mama's just a little girl) 
she gotta hold her head up high 
[Tupac Talking]
They ask us why we mutilate each other like we do 
And wonder why we hold such little worth for human life 
Facing all this drama 
But to ask us why we to turn from bad to worse 
Is to ignore from which we came 
You see you wouldn't ask why the rose that grew from the concrete had damaged petals 
On the contrary 
We would all celebrate its tenacity 
We would all love its will to reach the sun 
Well 
We are the roses (echo) 
This is the concrete (echo) 
And these are my damaged petals (echo) 
Don't ask me why (echo) 
Thank god nigga (echo) 
Ask me how (echo) 
(hahaha) 
You see, mama's just a little girl

Me Against The World

Nuttin to lose..
It's just me against the world baby

Oahhhh, oahhhahh
[2Pac]
I got nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world
[girl]
Oh-hahhh
[2Pac]
Stuck in the game
Me against the world baby
[Verse One: 2Pac]
Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city, the cops is hot for me
The projects is full of bullets, the bodies is droppin
There ain't no stoppin me
Constantly movin while makin millions
Witnessin killings, leavin dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Carries to children cause they're illin
Addicted to killin and the appeal from the cap peelin
Without feelin, but will they last or be blasted?
Hard headed bastard
Maybe he'll listen in his casket -- the aftermath
More bodies being buried -- I'm losing my homies in a hurry
They're relocating to the cemetary
Got me worried, stressin, my vision's blurried
The question is will I live?  No one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin this anger
Don't wanna make excuses, cause this is how it is
What's the use unless we're shootin no one notices the youth
It's just me against the world baby
[girl]
Me against the world
[2Pac]
It's just me against the world

Ooooh yeah, ooo-hooo

Hey!!

Ooooh yeah
[2Pac]
I got nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world baby
[girl]
I got nothing to lose
[Verse Two: Dramacydal]
Could somebody help me?  I'm out here all by myself
See ladies in stores, Baby Capone's, livin wealthy 
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin
Seein Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons, already crazy
and screamin I guess them nightmares as a child
had me scared, but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route?  For a crooked Outlaw
Veteran, a villian, a young thug, who one day shall fall
Everday there's mo' death, and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein mo' reasons for me to proceed with thievin
Scheme on the scheming and leave they peeps grieving
Cause ain't no bucks to stack up, my nuts is backed up
I'm bout to act up, go load the Mac up, now watch me klacka
Tried makin fat cuts, but yo it ain't workin
And Evil's lurking, I can see him smirking
when I gets to pervin, so what?
Go put some work in, and make my mail, makin sales
Risking 25 with a 'L', but oh well
[girl]
Me against the world
[2Pac]
With nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world
[girl]
Ooh yeah.. oooh-ooooh

Me against the world
I got nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world baby
[girl]
Ha-hahh (hehe) heyy!
[Verse Three: 2Pac]
With all this extra stressin
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finaly get to rest?  Through this supression
they punish the people that's askin questions
And those that possess, steal from the ones without possesions
The message I stress: to make it stop study your lessons
Don't settle for less - even the genius asks-es questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let the pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin of riches, in a position of makin a difference
Politicians and hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nuttin like the game
It's just me against the world
[girl]
Me against the world
[2Pac]
Nuttin to lose
It's just me against the world baby

Got me stuck in the game

Oahahhhh

I'd be ashamed to lose
It's just me against the world baby
[girl]
Me against the world
[Outro: 2Pac]
Heh, hahahahahahah
That's right
I know it seem hard sometimes but uhh
Remember one thing
Through every dark night, there's a bright day after that
So no matter how hard it get, stick your chest out
Keep your head up, and handle it

Sheeit, ju motherfuckin right
I'm the bitch that's keepin it live and keepin it hot
when you punk ass niggaz don't
Nigga Westside, WHAT!  Bring it on
[Tupac]
Look for me
Lost in the whirlwind, ninety-six, Bonnie and Clyde
Me and my girlfriend, do one-eighty-five when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin, born as a ghetto child
Raised in this whirlwind (c'mon)
Our childhood years recall the tears heart laced with venom
Smokin sherm, drinkin malt liquor, father forgive her
Me and my girlfriend, hustlin, fell in love with the struggle
Hands on the steering wheel, blush, while she bail out bustin
Fuck em all, watch em fall screamin, automatic gunfire
exorcisin all demons
Mafias on the side, my congregation high, ready to die
We bail out to take the jail back, niggaz united
Our first date, couldn't wait to see you naked
Touch you in every secret place, I can hardly wait
to bust freely, got you red hot, you so happy to see me
Make the frontpage primetime live on TV
Nigga my girlfriend, baby forty-five but she still live
One shot make a nigga's heartbeat stop
[girl]
What!! I'm bustin on you punk ass niggaz *automatic gunfire*
Run nigga run! *gunfire* I'm on yo' ass nigga! *gunfire continues*
Run nigga, duck and hide!  Nigga I'm bustin all you bitches!
Run nigga, yeah!  Westside!  Uh uh uh!  Die nigga die!
[Tupac]
My girlfriend, blacker than the darkest night
When niggaz act bitch-made she got the heart to fight
Nigga my girlfriend, though we seperated at times
I knew deep inside, baby girl would always be mine
Picked you up when you was nine, started out my life of crime
wit you, bought you some shells when you turned twenty-two
It's true, nothin compares to the satisfaction
that I feel when we out mashin, me and my girlfriend
[Chorus: Tupac]
All I need in this life of sin, is me and my girlfriend
Down to ride to the bloody end, just me and my girlfriend
[repeat 2X]
[Tupac]
I was too immature
to understand your ways, inexperienced back in the days
Caused so many arguments and strays
Now I realize how to treat ya, the secret to keep ya
Bein faithful now cause now cheatin's lethal
We closer than the hands of time, deeper than the drop of mankind
I trust you dearly, I shoot blind
In time I clock figures, droppin niggaz as we rise
We all soldiers in God's eyes -- now it's time for war
Never leave me baby, I'm paranoid, sleepin witcha
loaded by my bedside crazy
Jealous when you hang wit the fellas, I wait patiently alone 
anticipated for the moment you come home
I'm waitin by the phone this is true love, I can feel it
I've had a lot of women in my bed, but you the realeast
So if you ever need me call, I'll be there through it all
You're the reason I can stand tall, me and my girlfriend
[Chorus]
[Tupac]
I love finger fuckin you, all of a sudden I'm hearin thunder
When you bust a nut, niggaz be duckin or takin numbers
Love to watch you at a block party, beggin for drama
While unleashin on the old timers, that's on my mama
I would trade my life for yours, behind closed doors
the only girl that I adore, everything I'm askin for
Talkin to me beggin me to just, take you around
Seventeen like Brandy you just Wanna Be Down
Talkin loud when I tell you be quiet you move the crowd
Bustin rounds, activatin a riot, that's why I love you so
No control, down to roll, unleash
After a hit you break apart, then back to one piece
Much love to my one and only girlfriend, the world is ours
Just hold me down, baby witness the power
Never leave a nigga alone, I love you black or chrome
Turn this house into a happy home, me and my girlfriend
[Chorus 3X]
Lost in the whirlwind, ninety-six, Bonnie and Clyde
Me and my girlfriend, do one-eighty-five when we ride
Trapped in this world of sin, born as a ghetto child
Raised in the whirlwind -- look for me
[repeat 3X]
Lost in the whirlwind, ninety-six, Bonnie and Clyde
Me and my girlfriend
[repeat 2X]
ME AND MY GIRLFRIEND!

Suppress the revolution of premeditated scheme

Introduce a drug called crack 
To us ghetto teens 
[echo]
Got a law for raw niggas now 
Playa what it be like? 
[echo]
When will niggas see they got us bleeding with 3 strikes 
[echo]
Can't seem to focus 
Hopeless 
With violent thoughts 
I wrote this 
Got these devils petrified 
Hiding from my hocus pocus 
And so I learned to earn my currency 
And over time 
[echo]
Affiliated 
Clearly click a military mind 
[echo]
May god forgive us 
Though we dwell inside a paradox 
Thugged out and drug dealing 
>From the womb to the block 
[echo]
My live mind got me surviving 5 shots 
[echo]
My 45 got me fortified with live rounds 
When shit stick 
We plot hits 
When our block spits 
All hail 
Out on bail 
Wrath of 2pacalypse

Forever ghetto 
Necessary picture food stamps 
Outlaw thug niggas

 Cocoa Brovas]
I'm a nigga for assignment 
One of the suqads finest 
[echo]
Skilled in gorilla warfare 
And blessed 
Work with firearm 
[echo]
My rap shit 
Contains sections of bomb sessions 
Says I'm responsible for black smith and wessons 
[echo]
Putting up on ?? in the military state of mind

Dangerous like chronic and yard when combined 
Cocoa Brovas pan the borderline

That's the sound and your dead son 
Man to man 
I'm facing the devil with a plan

Judo stance 
First glance 
I'm making my advance 
[echo]
Animal instincts 
Intelligence of an assassin 
[echo]
Mask my ninja style 
Surround me ready to attack 
[echo]
I react swiftly 
What father taught me sticks with me 
[echo]
Never forget the methods stick and move strictly 
[echo]
Shit be seeming like its closing in 
With no regrets I hold position 
Cause I circles 
I'm one of the chosen men 
[echo]
Picture being put in position to move 
[echo]
And you can't move 
Cause your move is blocked by the knight at 12 O'clock 
That's when the madness beings 
[echo]
So I start to focusing 
My thoughts on the war 
Cause the rule is the law 
[echo]
And the law that we live by is to stay true to self 
In this case beady eye 
[echo]
Why try 
Everybody lie 
About the block 
True soldier mentality 
This is how we rock and move 
[echo]
Stick and move 
Time to show what kinda nigga 
Move or get moved on 
Lets see whos strong

In the days of the strange 
Where nothing stays the same 
With new faces come through with similar game 
[echo]
And who you thought them 
Really ain't they (echo) 
Catching deja vu 
Of the game people play 
[echo]
It's a call for re-adjustment 
Fine tune your positions 
You slipping and tripping 
Instead of bobbing and dipping 
[echo]
Will never let this world of stress get me 
[echo]
Taking breathing techniques 
Slay you with tai chi

What did you change 
To get a break 
In the world of snakes 
And those who fake 
Elimination I'm facing 
Destruction 
Outlaw till I duck down 
[echo]
From po po's bustin' 
No one to trust in 
Rushing to the goal line 
Catch a nigga 
Beat him 
Treat him like he stole mine 
[echo]
No swine 
I'm a soldier 
Told cha I control mine 
[echo]
Time to take you back into time 
Follow this here 
One way out 
This black hole 
For this black soul 
Shit is outta control 
I'm fighting for my position 
To be a fetus in this world I am entering 
[echo]
And my face is sentencing for repentance 
[echo]
Before my body was fully formed into a human 
[echo]
I was already consuming weed 
Cause my mom's use to smoke back in the 70's 
[echo]
Maybe that's why in the 90's 
I drop g's when I drop degrees 
[echo]
When I ease across the block 
With Pac 
[echo]
And got all you niggas shot 
You didn't think 
Boot Camp click would link 
With the outlaw minded 
If you do you press rewind 
And you can peep gorilla tactics in every line

M.O.B. 
(feat. Outlawz)
[Chorus 2X: 2Pac]
M.O.B., nigga 'cause we mob on you tricks
and you know we keep it money over bitches
[2Pac]
Thugs known to bust on sight
God bless my crazy life la vida loca homie livin that thug life
Been raised in violence homicide's my lullaby
Came with the homies and learned to kick it until we die
Boss players you wonder why
I live the life of a ghetto kingpin, just let me ride
Bitches and niggaz in penitentary suits
I send 'em letters and money orders and make 'em my troops
As for you females, I got no time, I gotta get mine
You cannot blind me addicted to a life of crime
My time as shorty was full of car chases
While runnin with John Gotti's and Scarface's
Niggas knew, I'd be the Don in my own crew
A million niggaz with automatics who swarm through
You wonder who shot me here's a clue, stay alert
Cause we comin' for you, and keep it money over bitches
[Chorus w/ ad libs]
[Fatal]
I blow you up on the spot, these glocks hot 'til you drop
All you wannabe cops, you don't wanna see shots
I beef deep with the police peep what these streets do to me
Actin all new to me I creep on you like puberty
You don't wanna see the bad image of this scrimmage
From here to East Greenwich through every state with a sentence
Frozen weight in the cooter, ten plates to soup ya
1 2's we oughta cruise right by the state troopers
When I'm drinkin Cristal, start thinkin 'bout Al
Bacardi coverin my body at the wink and a smile
Bag a hottie or two, cause butter shotties for you
I got more bodies then Drew, I drink Mynotti on New, fuck your crew
This type of shit I do for a petty hobby
Fuck the world it's Fatal dog against everybody
[Chorus]
[Mopreme]
My shit's phenomenal, droppin like domino
Comin with the real yo and fuck what you feel yo
This is not for all the freaks in short skirts
This is for my niggaz nationwide doin work, get your feelings hurt
Lose mo' faith than a composure, money and the doja
Bitches is a cobra with deadly venom
Move as smooth as I get 'em, stackin G's
My niggas crosstown got ki's
Hoes get diseased and fleas, for these enemies money over bitches
(Nigga!)
[Chorus]
[Big Syke]
I'm hittin sixteen switches, my money over bitches
The struggle continues I'll miss you on my road to riches
I'm contribed to strive never laggin
Disappear in the night with my 64 dragon, rag flaggin
As I get 'em up and leave 'em stuck
Pager blowin up but I don't give a fuck
I'm fully stocked on the block, pockets full of rocks sellin
Loc'ers and smokers engaged twenty-fo'/seven
So what can you do for me and what can I do for you
But stay true, and do the things that we do
Blinded evil-minded no option for my offspring
Reminded can't find it complications what the future brings
Losin my mind why you sweatin me all the time
I'm caught in a bind, quality time on my grind
Rather be lonely honey and dodge you like snitches
I'm 'bout my riches, money over bitches
[Chorus]
[E.D.I.]
That's from the time a nigga close his eyes I'm hopin, I hope he awoken
Payin my own that's tokin chokin off-a glocks smokin
Money and power watch these bitches cause they skanless
Gettin niggaz fucked 'n stuck from Timbuk' to Los Angeles
Ain't a nigga ruggeder than this grimy Heine' guzzler
Cowards better duck before my calibers start rubbin ya
Me and my troops play blocks in groups, runnin in flocks
Deuce-deuce in my socks keepin a watch out for cops
Gettin kicked, I keep my mind on my riches
While uncontrolled schemes keep me choosin my money over all my bitches
[Chorus - 2X]
[2Pac]
That's right nigga
Money over motherfuckin bitches
M.O.B. on 'em nigga
Keep your motherfuckin mind on your money, fuck these hoes
(Thug life baby) You don't need no motherfuckin bitches
You need some motherfuckin money
Get your mind right nigga, keep your game tight
Play right play by the rules and you'll get paid fuck the fools
We up out of this bitch here

My Block (Remix) 
[2Pac]
Damn, take a ride, to my block
My block, that's right!  Heh
F'real on my motherfuckin block
[Verse One]
They got a nigga
Sheddin tears, reminiscin on my past fears
Cause shit was hectic for me last year
It appears that I've been marked for death, my heartless breath
The underlying cause of my arrest, my life is stressed
And no rest forever weary, my eyes stay teary
for all the brothers that are buried in the cemetery
Shit is scary, how black on black crime legendary
But at times unnessecary, I'm gettin worried
Teardrops and closed caskets, the three strikes law is drastic
And certain death for us ghetto bastards
What can we do when we're arrested, but open fire
Life in the pen ain't for me, cause I'd rather die
But don't cry through your despair
I wonder if the Lord still cares, for us niggaz on welfare
And who cares if we survive
The only time they notice a nigga is when he's clutchin on a four-five
My neighborhood ain't the same
Cause all these little babies goin crazy and they sufferin in the game
And I swear it's like a trap
But I ain't given up on the hood, it's all good when I go back
Hoes show me love, niggaz give me props
Forever hop cause it don't stop... on my block
[Chorus: a bunch of kids - see the liner notes]
Livin life is but a dream
Hard times is all we see (on my block)
Every block is kinda mean
But on our block we still prayyyyyy
But on our block we still prayyyyyy...
[Verse Two]
Now shit's constantly hot, on my block, it never fails to be gunshots
Can't explain a mother's pain, when her son drops
Black male slippin in hail when will we prevail
Fearin jail but crack sales got me livin well
And the system's sucidal with this Thug's Life
Stayin strapped forever strapped in this drug life
God help me, cause I'm starvin, can't get a job
So I resort to violent robberies, my life is hard
Can't sleep cause all the dirt make my heart hurt
Put in work and shed tears for my dead peers
Mislead from childhood where I went astray
Till this day I still pray for a better way
Can't help but feel hopeless and heartbroke
From the start I felt the racism cause I'm dark
Couldn't quit the bullshit make me represent
Hit the bar and played the star, everywhere I went
In my heart, I felt alone out here on my own
I close my eyes and picture home... on my block
[Chorus w/ minor variations]
[Verse Three]
And I can't help but wonder why, so many young kids had to die
Caught strays from AK's and the driveby
Swollen pride and homicide, don't coincide
Brothers cry for broken lives, mama come inside
Cause our block is filled with danger
Used to be a close knit community but now we're all cold strangers
Time changes us to stone them crack pipes
All up and down the block exterminatin black life
But I can't blame the dealers
My mama's welfare check has brought the next man chrome wheels
Shit's real, I know ya feel, my tragedy
A single mother with a problem child, daddy free
Hangin out pickin up game, sippin cheap liquor
Gamin the hoochies hopin I can get to sleep with her
It's a man's world, stayin strapped
Fantasies of a nigga livin phat, but held back
Pipe dreams can make the night seem hopeless
Wide eyed and losin focus... on my block
[Chorus w/ minor variations]
[Verse Four]
And block parties in tha projects lastin way past daylight
A young nigga learned to break night
Used to play fight with my homies but they stuck in the pen
I send them ends, but it's tough on a friend, in my mind
I see the same motherfuckers ballin
Alcohol will make a lazy nigga slip and fall, miss his call
I know the young niggaz understand this
Growing up in this world where everything is scandalous
I reminisce on tha fast times, past crimes
Tryin to cop a slice of pizza with my last dime
Can't explain, just what attracts me to this dirty game
Gold chains, some extra change, and the street fame
And what's strange is everybod knows my name, swear they all know me
And lots of cash make a nigga change
I hit the green just to maintain, feelin pain
For all the niggaz that I lost to the game... from my block
[Chorus w/ minor variations; kids repeat last line over and over]
[2Pac - speaking over Chorus]
Rest in peace to all the muh'fuckers who passed away
From all the blocks that I'm from
One-twelve street, 7th Avenue, New York, Uptown, knahmsayin?
183rd and Walt, my block, that's right
122nd and Morningside, my block, that's right
Decatur Avenue, Baltimore, my block, that's right
In the jungle of Marin City, that's my block, that's right
Los Angeles, haha, that's my block too
Oakland, can't forget Oaktown, that's my block for sure
And all the other blocks around this motherfucker
Houston, Florida, St. Louis, Tennessee, Miami, Chicago
All y'all niggaz stay kickin up dust
Represent the motherfuckin block

My Closest Roaddogz 
Me and my closest road dogz
To my dog named Musolini, Big Syke, Thug Life baby
The return of the mashers, you know how we do it
Hahaha!
[2Pac]
Shit half the times we flaunt cause trouble
My closest road dog it was cool cause I love you
Fuck what they talkin bout
Let me take you back in time, rewind to eighty-nine
Introduced me to this life of crime, but we was blind
Little nappy-haired juveniles, livin wild
No smiles on our faces, thirteen catchin cases
Indeed, it was misery
Driven by my own demons, cause they was killin me
How can I be sure I'll be saved soon?
Catch me dip into the light, of a stray moon
It's gettin deeper now, let me get yo' mind right
Fuck yo' enemies, nigga grip yo' nine tight, tonight's the night
Murder murder Mr. Lucifer
Pictures of the devil DUCK when he shoot at cha, it's all political
Runnin from the future, escapin in the fog
Live yo' life like a hog nigga, me and my closest road dogz
[Chorus: sung]
Every ghetto street got a crosswalk
Let me get to the other side with my road dogz
All roam in the scary place called home
Take a second victim and if they all gone, my closest road dogz
Every ghetto street got a stop sign
Can I trust in you my road dogz on mine?
Even when I'm goin through hard times
I still got my closest road dogz lookin out for all mine
[2Pac]
Haha.. bring artillery and ROLL with a nigga
They could never take the soul of a M.O.B. soldier nigga
Cowards get rolled up, mob on 'em Makaveli
Boy youse a boss player, that's what all the bitches tell me
Even if I died now
I live my life eternally and never lie down, why cry now?
Fooled a few but never 'came a gamer, ain't tryin to hear it
Evil spirits hide at total strangers, yo' life's in danger
Prepare nigga be aware, cause we ain't scared
M.O.B., 'til I die, when we ride niggaz disappear
Fill 'em up with pistol smoke
Never forget to blow a hole in his head
for leakin information to the feds
The burnin bed was the tellin sign
Two hired guns bustin everyone, yellin everybody die
Why the fuck they fuck around, we left 'em in the fog
bleedin like a stuck hog, me and my closest road dogz
[Chorus]
[2Pac]
Fuck they feelings, that's what they get for squealin
That's the pressures of a gangsta, dangerous this drug dealin
See me in physical form, my niggaz swarm
Take the figure of a circle beatin jealous niggaz 'til they purple
Simon Says take they heads homies
and send them phony motherfuckers to dwell with all they dead homies
Fishin for fake niggaz, observe and shake niggaz
The only way to see six figures, is break niggaz
Me and Musolini set to ride we high
Big Bogart got the alibi if homicide ask us way
Labelled a Capo in the mob as big as the globe
To live and die as a millionaire, on ..
Set to explode, my M.O., is kill them hoes
My pistol's like a disease, my enemies and foes
Get murdered and disposed of, we in the fog
Makaveli the Don, and my closest road dogz
[Chorus - 2X]

Never B Peace 
[Verse 1: Tupac]
Now of course I want peace on the streets 
But realistically 
Painting perfect pictures ain't never work 
My misery was so deep 
Couldn't sleep through all my pressures 
In my quest for cash 
I learned fast 
Using violent measures 
Memories of adolescent years 
Their was unity 
But after puberty we brought war 
To our community 
So many bodies dropping 
Its gotta stop 
I want to help 
But still I'm stepping 
Keeping my weapon 
Must protect myself 
The promise of a better tomorrow 
ain't never reach me 
Plus my teachers were to petrified in class to teach me 
Sipping thunderbird 
And grape kool-aid 
Calling Earl since my stomach was empty 
It seduced me to fuck the world 
Watch my 'lil homies 
Lose there childhood to guns 
Nobody cries no more 
Cause we all die for fun 
So why you ask me if I want peace 
If you cant grant it 
Niggas fighting across the whole planet 
So we can never be peace 
[Chorus]
Will there ever be peace? 
Or all we all just headed for doom, 
Still consumed by the beefs, 
And I know there never be peace, 
That's why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets 
Cause there can never be peace 
[Verse 2: Kastro]
Somebody owes me 
Will they control me?, nah 
I ain't a hater playa 
But I want all you got 
Your babies have babies 
Now we fighting each other 
My dogs got rabies 
They biting each other 
'n' it ain't hard to find a friend like mine 
Big fully is a bully 
And he don't mind dying 
And I gotta be bright 
Miss sign after sign 
Time after time 
After time after time 
And I don't like nobody 
They don't like me more 
And I'm cool with that finally 
But they heard it before 
Dog 
We living in a prison 
Losing our religion on em 
Thanks given when thankful just for living in hell 
Damn homey I don't mean to be harsh 
But it's the devil in the ghetto trying to tear it apart 
And if we make it up out 
We still stuck in the dark 
Will there ever be peace? 
Just the peace in my heart 
Never 
[Kastro talking]
The only peace we got 
Is the peace in our heart 
Or the peace in our mind 
Right there in piece that we hold in our waste line 
Feel me dog? 
Cm'on 
[Chorus]
Will there ever be peace? 
Or all we all just headed for doom, 
Still consumed by the beefs, 
And I know there never be peace, (never) 
Thats why I keep my pistol when I walk the streets 
'Coz there can never be peace 
[Verse 3: Napolean]
Things are changing 
Nigga you better fantasize 
I'm only concerned about me and mine in these times 
The world is a ghetto where peace is not a part of it 
We all goin' need God if we plan to get out of this 
Niggas spending too much time hating on each other 
Niggas buyin' guns 
Load em up 
Aim at each other 
And the victim is you and me 
The secret is true indeed 
The good die 
Mostly over bullshit 
Repeatedly 
Deep in me there's a part that wants nothing but love 
But the rest of me knows war is what's waiting for us 
So I stays ready 
Keep my pay heavy and boss up 
Stack my funds and my guns 
Never rely on luck 
Asking God to point out the imposters 
Never let no weapon formed against me prosper 
Cause they'll never be peace 
So don't rely on it 
Soldiers die for 
And in the ghetto, they trying for it 
FUCK PEACE 
[Chorus X3]
Will there ever be peace? 
Or all we all just headed for doom, 
Still consumed by the beefs, 
And I know there never be peace, 
That's why I keep my pistol when I walks the streets 
Cause there can never be peace 
[Tupac Talking]
Shit, fuck peace 
On the strength till my niggas get a piece 
We cant have peace 
How the fuck we gonna live happy if we ain't got none? 
You motherfuckers is smiling, but I'm mean mugging 
Why? Cause gotta be thugging 
I've seen drugs done turned this motherfucking hood out 
All us niggas acting up 
Wild ass motherfucking adolescents 
These niggas ain't even got no childhoods no more 
How the fuck can you have a childhood and you have a funeral every motherfucking weekend 
And you motherfuckers talking about peace? 
Nigga, it ain't no motherfucking peace 
You ain't seen the news motherfucker? 
You ain't heard? 
Little babies getting smoked 
Motherfuckers killing there whole family 
'Lil kids getting thrown off buildings 
Motherfuckers gettin abused 
Peace? Niggas you out your motherfucking mind? 
Fuck peace

Never Call U Bitch Again 
(feat. Tyrese)
[2Pac]
Whassup Boo?  Swear I'll never call you bitch again
You ain't fuck with me, hehehe
I swear I'll never call you bitch again
(All I just wanna say is um, if I fuckin apologized)
I swear I'll never call you bitch again
(I ain't mean to call you a bitch)
I'll never call you bitch again
[Verse One: 2Pac]
Damn - gave my homey 90 days for domestic violence
I try to picture myself, in this position but remain silent
I get to thinkin bout this shit, we been through
We close like kin but you remain my friend to
This life of sin, done got the both of us in trouble
But you always stay down for a nigga, so that's why I love you
Reminiscin needin tissues, fightin over childish issues
Swear I can't live witchu but withouchu every day I miss you
When we roll you hold my pistol, my gangsta bitch-ich
You always in the mood for love, that's why I'm sleepin witchu
Though not the man of your dreams, my plan and schemes
To be rich like a king, and live my life, trouble free
I see yesterday I called you names, and played games on yo' mind
I promise that I'll change in time
It's a complicated world, so girl just be a friend
I swear I'll never call you bitch again (and that's my word)
[Chorus: Tyrese + (2Pac)]
We came.. too far..
to throw it all away
(I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me)
We came.. way too far pretty baby
to throw it all away, throw it all away
(I swear I'll never call you bitch again, heyyy)
[Verse Two: 2Pac]
I wake up early in the mornin, at the crack of dawn
Nigga still tired so I'm yawnin, and now I'm gone
Tryin to get my money on strong, so an early riser
Out befo' them other guys, that's the way to profit every time
Can't get too close, my enemies, they see ghosts, they envy me
Plus we been beefin with the East coast, with casualites
Got stopped in traffic, had a warrant, so they gaffled me
But while I'm gone, watch my business, and my back for me
My enemies think they got me crossed, they ain't knowin
Ain't no love for player haters where you cowards goin
You paid bail, got me out of jail, home again
I promise not to leave you on your own again
Cristal corks are popped, romantic, thoughts are dropped
It's so frantic but don't panic cause we crossed the top
I found a partner and a rider, a woman and friend
I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me
[Chorus]
['Pac speaks over Chorus]
I know, I know
All that is dead though, I'm changed, I'm tellin you..
I know what time it is, gotta give a nigga time
to grow up y'knahmsayin?  That was way back then
[Tyrese]
You're my nigga, my best friend
Never gonna call you, a bitch again
Yea yea yea
Ohhhhhhhhhh
[Verse Three: 2Pac]
Witness the evil men do, all this shit I been through
Never meant to hurt you, can we make this work boo?
I know you been feelin pain, things are not the same
"Waitin to Exhale" while I'm sittin in the county jail
Keep yo' head up, cause things are gettin better
My cellmates shed tears off yo' last love letter
Told 'em you would find a friend so keep yo' eyes peeled
Sorry if I cuss but it's the suffering that I feel
Who can I trust and if I bust will she snitch
Even though you ain't the type to trip
Sorry if I called you bitch
You showed me the definition of feminine
The difference between a pack of bitches and black women
I see the boss for the third time, hope to see you soon
Pictures of us kissin in the living room, in the nude
Thanks for bein there, much more than a friend
I swear I'll never call you bitch again, believe me

N.I.G.G.A. (Never Ignorant About Getting Goals Accomplished) 
(feat. Jadakiss)
[Intro]
 (2Pac)
Niggas! (Yeah!) (Uh)
Niggas!
[Verse: 2Pac]
Who's afraid of the punk police?
Niggas run the streets, no justice no peace
Fuck the law, rather draw than do time
Don't fuck with mine, cross the line, my two nines
go baya baya when I shoot 'em
Korean mothafuckers was crooked, so niggas had to burn and loot 'em
Now the streets ain't safe at night
My Niggas! Straight take his life
So don't sleep when my Jeep creep up, how we hit 'em
Empty the clip, then dip cuz we did 'em
Lickin' of shots for Latasha that's proper
Love for my niggas but a glock for the coppers
So what the fuck you wanna do now
I packed a .9 last year, in '99 I'm packin' 2 now
And even if they pull their triggers
They can shoot one man, but nothings gonna stop the plan of true niggas
[Chorus (2Pac)]
Niggas! (Yeah niggas, you can't fuck with us)
Niggas! (Cuz bein' a nigga means you love niggas)
Niggas!
(Jada!, ey yo)
[Verse: Jadakiss]
My dimes make the fiends go to sleep, so they call 'em bedrocks
Niggas is like photographers, all they take is head shots
Your last words'll be, "damn what's all these red dots?"
Niggas nowawadays, they worry me, my bars is therapy
As long as you usin' them thouroughly, muah til the day that they bury me
My niggas is stronger and tighter now than they probably will ever be
And i'm a product of the '70's
The hood got niggas on punishment, that's why they never leave
If I ain't eatin' with you, i'm probably beefin' with you
If no money ain't involved ain't no need for me speakin' with you
I know you got a gun but i'm hopin' you keep it with you
Cuz unfortunately, i'm one of them rappers that keep a pistol and 
You know what the llama do, Shady/Aftermath, Ruff Ryders, D-Block, and of course Amaru
Lotta people honor you, probably cuz of the way you used to bring the drama to
whoever you wanted to, you a leader when you can get a leader to follow you
But anyway, life goes on, so i'll see you when I art in heaven like our fathers do
[Chorus (2Pac)]
Niggas! (Yeah niggas, you can't fuck with us)
Niggas! (Yeah niggas, cuz bein' a nigga means you love niggas)
Niggas!
Niggas! (Nigga!, you can't fuck with us)

Niggaz Nature Remix 
(feat. Lil' Mo)
[Lil' Mo]
Tupac and Lil' Mo, hmm, how gangsta is that?
Hehe.. ooooh-oooh, ooooh-oooh, ooooh-oooh
[Mo keeps harmonizing in the background]
[2Pac]
One two.. to a nigga nature, haha..
No need to cry now, go wipe your tears, be a woman
Why you actin surprised?  You saw the bullshit
Comin fake hair, fake nails, fake eyes too
So why you, bound to fuck wit fake guys too
Aint nothin' hard about it why you lookin sad?  Shoulda though about it
Say you learned, I truly doubt it
I guess you got a problem with affection, kinda loose with the love
Gettin freaky with the thug niggaz up in the club
Ask to buy you a drink, you holla Dom Perignon
Knowin I'm a cash getter still I, remain calm
Let you chill with me; plus you was smilin 'til the bill miss me
That's what you get for tryin to dick me
Missed me with that "Buy me this, buy me that" syndrome shit
Bitch get a job if you wanna be rich
Gettin mad cause I cursed and I scream I hate'cha
Introduced you to a nigga nature, feel me?
[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
Kissed the girls, made them cry
Thuggin life, and gettin high
Why you gangsta, all the time?
That's a thug's nature
Though sometimes, I can deal with it
I realize, that I'm feelin it
It's a love and hate relationship
but that's a thug's nature
[add to line four of Chorus first time:]
 "That's a nigga nature"
[2Pac]
I'm probably too nice at first, I let you kiss me where it hurts
Me and you gettin busy, slingin dick in the dirt
Met you at a pool party it was cool to kick it
See us, tounge-kissin, you was truly with it
Little ecstacy, Hennesey, mix with me
Picture me pay for pussy when the dick's for free
Hey now, where my niggaz at?  Tell these hoes
Before I pay; I jerk off, word to Moses
Visions of you sittin there sweaty and wet
Pointin to the places that you want me to hit
Give me room all up in the womb, call the cops
Nigga, hittin walls 'til them bastard drop
Label me Makaveli - thug nigga with bite
Livin life like a rock star's Friday night
Make money, get pussy, always keep a pager
Cell phone in the ride to complete my nature now!
[Chorus]
[2Pac]
Haha.. started as a seed from the semen; straight outta papa's nuts
Lustin for creamin - bitches with big butts
Curves make a nigga cry, tits and shit
When I'm locked down beggin you for porno flicks
Sneak weed in, help a nigga pass the time
Put my name tattoo'd so that ass is mine
Tell everybody; 'Pac put it down for good
A local legend through the whole hood, follow me
I got a gun on me, goin for none on the run baby
You know a nigga need some, is my son crazy?
Why I cry, when I be thuggin til I die
Picture a nigga in heaven, high off weed I fly
Got me missin dead homies wishin phonies would die
Hit the weed and hope it get me high; dear God
Understand my ways, livin major
Blessed with a thug's heart.. and a real live nigga nature

No More Pain 
[Intro: 2Pac]
Hey DeVante
Nigga, don'tcha know we're gonna sow up every bitch in the country
Me and you, up in the same motherfuckin room
On the same level
This shit here, hahahaha
Please, no more pain
That's right nigga
Hey drop that shit boy
[Verse One: 2Pac]
My adversaries cry like hoes fully eradicate my foes
My lyrics explode on contact, gamin you hoes
Who else but Mama's only son, fuck the phony niggaz I'm the one
Say my name, watch bitches come, now fire
when ready, stay watchin now figure, increase speed
Make you motherfuckers bleed from your mouth quicker
Plus all these niggaz that you run with, be on some dumb shit
Trick on the hoes, I ain't the one bitch
Holla my name and witness game official, it's so sick 
Have every single bitch that came witchu, on my dick
Plus this alcohol increases the chance to be deceased
I'm movin you stupid bitches, vicious telekenesis
Am I reachin your brain?  Nigga how can I explain?
How vicious this Thug motherfucker came
When I die, I wanna be a livin legend, say my name
Affiliated with this motherfuckin game, with no more pain
[Chorus: (interpretation of Method Man's "Bring the Pain")]
I came to bring the pain, hardcore to the brain
Let's go inside my astral plane (no more pain) 
[variations]
[repeat 4X]
[Verse Two: 2Pac]
Line up my adversaries, blast on sight, and fuck your boyfriend
Bitch, I want some ass tonight, you know my steelo
Alize and Cristal, weed sure you heard of all the
sure you've heard of all the freaky shit they say about me, huh
Plus all you busters is jealous, pull your gun out and blast
I dare you niggaz to open fire, I'll murder that ass
And disappear before the cops come runnin, my glock's spittin rounds
niggaz fallin down clutchin they stomach
It's Westside, Death Row, Thug niggaz on the rise
Busters shot me five times, real niggaz don't die
Can ya hear me?  Laced with this game, I know you fear me
Spit the secret to war, so cowards fear me
My only fear of death is reincarnation
Heart of a solider with a brain to teach your whole nation
And feelin no more pain
[Chorus 4X]
[Verse Three: 2Pac]
Bury me that's what they all say, it's time to make a killin
Sure to make a million with DeVante
Bitch I know you want me, what your mouth say? Now, watch your eyes
You don't wanna get with me, that's a lie
I got my hands on your hips, no time to bullshit
Freaky bitch, come give me kiss
Tell them niggaz from other areas, brothers from here
So obsessed with this money makin it ain't nothin we fear
Now they label me a troublemaker, cause I'm a ridah
Death to you playa haters, don't let me find ya
Mama made me rugged, baptised the public
Now you hard thugs, nigga don't you love it
It's similar to multiple gunshots, retaliation is a must
Wasn't too sure what you facin so watch the guns bust
You niggaz'll bleed, fuckin with me you'll be deceased
Never restin in peace nigga, with no more pain
[Chorus 8X]
[Tupac talking over the chorus]
Hahahahaha, yeah nigga, yeah! Hahahaha
No more pain
It's just like that nigga, like that yeah
No more pain
Motherfuckers can't handle that shit
Much too much for these bitches
No more pain
Feel me nigga?  Feel me?
How you figure you can fuck with me?
Fully automatic type shit
No more pain
Coward ass niggaz, cowards
Come put your mouth on this pistol nigga
Come put your mouth on the pistol, no more pain
Close your eyes nigga, do it
Die in the dark, no more pain
Death Row, so what you motherfuckers do?
Hey that's DeVante droppin that beat like that BEYATCH

Westsiiiiiide!  Death to everybody that ain't down with me

Oh yeah, to the cowards, you know what I mean

Prison ain't changed me nigga, it made me worse

Nothin But Love 
Straight outta Oakland, California where we spark it on ya
Give a shout out to my partners in the darkest corners
I remember drinkin Hennesey, smokin weed
Fantasize about the things we'd grow to be
Had a partner named Snoop, loved to clown a stank
Smoke a pound a day, commenced to down a drank
Shooting craps in the alley til they chased us off
Pour a little for my homies but don't waste it all
Oooohweee, who popped that coochie best?
On my tattooed chest is where the hoochies rest
Having house parties in a crowded spot
And you can tell it's hot, they talk loud a lot
Everybody wanna dance when the slow jam come
Lookin dumb, cause you waitin for your chance to hump
Straight grindin, everybody havin fun
And it's cool til a fool pull a loaded gun
Cause another dude kicked his Bacardi over
He had to act a fool now the party's over
Gun shots rang like it's thunder
And everybody bum rushing and I'm rushing to get a number
Says she got a man but she's lying
Why? I seen her talking to this other guy and..
he's a dealer so you know she gonna sweat him
I ain't trippin I just hope he get em, I got nuttin but love
[chorus]
[singers]
 Ain't got nuttin but love for ya
[2Pac]
 I'm down for yours, nuttin but love
[repeat 4X]
I love to go back, to the block I got my game from
Cause uh, old man still drinkin, his breath still stinkin
He'd love to tell ya what he's thinkin
But I can't diss him he's my elder
He been livin here longer what that tell ya?
And little girls playin double dutch
Still blush, cause she don't get in trouble much
It's uhh, ponytails and barrettes
I gotta make it back home, before the sun decides to set
And little boys playin stick ball, quick y'all
Get out the street before they hit y'all
And as I reminisce, I think about my ghetto bliss
And wonder how we came to this
I help an old lady across the street, the cost is free
I can't take what she offers me
And this is how the world could be
This is how the world should be
Feels good to be back on the streets
Cause I know they got love for me, nuttin but love
[chorus]
When I was young I used to want to be a dealer see
Cause the gold and cars they appealed to me
I saw our brothers getting rich slangin crack to folks
And the square's getting big for these sack of dope
Started thinking bout a plan to get paid myself
So I made myself, raised myself
Til the dealer on the block told me, "That ain't cool
You ain't meant to slang crack, you a rapper fool"
I got my game about women from a prostitute
And way back used to rap on the block for loot
I tryed to make my way legit, haha
But it was hard, cause rhymes don't pay the rent
And uhh, it was funny how I copped out
I couldn't make it in school, so finally I dropped out
My family on welfare
I'm steady thinking, since don't nobody else care
I'm out here on my own
At least in jail I have a meal and I wouldn't be alone
I'm feelin like a waste, tears rollin down my face
Cause my life is filled with hate
Until I looked around me
I saw nothing but family, straight up down for me
Panthers, Pimps, Pushers and Thugs
Hey yo, that's my family tree, I got nuttin but love
[chorus repeats for a while w/o 2Pac]

 ain't got nuttin but love for ya

Nothing To Lose 
[Verse 1]
The only way to change me is maybe blow my brains out
stuck in the middle of the game to get the pain out
Pray to my God everyday but he don't listen
the poverty bothers me but mama's working wonders in the kitchen
Listen I can hear her crying in the bedroom
praying for money we never think would she be dead soon
Am I wrong for wishing I was somewhere else
at 13 can't feed myself
Can I blame daddy 'cause he left me
wish he would've helped me
too much like him 'til my mama don't love me
On my own at a early age gettin' paid
and I'm strapped so I'll never be afraid
Where did I go astray I'm hanging in the back streets
running with G's and dope fiends will they jack me?
Can't turn back my eyes on the prize
I got nothing to lose
everybody gotta die
say good-bye to the bad guy
that one you fucked when you passed by
Buck buck 
[gunshots]
 from a Glock
tempured glass fly
Do or Die walk a mile in my shoes
and you'd be crazy too
with nothing to lose
[Chorus]
I got nothing to lose
(that's why I got gang related)
got nothing to lose 
[5x]
nothing to lose
[Verse 2]
I thank the Lord for my many blessings
though I'm stressin' keep a vest for protection
from the barrel of the Smith 
&
 Wesson
and all my niggas in the pen'
here we go again
Ain't nothing seperating us from a mack 10
Born in the ghetto as a hustla older
straight soldier bucking at them bustas
No matter how you try niggas never die
We just retaliate with hate then we multiply
see me striking down the block hittin' co'ners
Mobbin' like a muthafucka livin' like I wanna
Ain't no stoppin' at the red lights I'm sideways
Thug Life muthafucka criiime pays
Let the cops put they lights on
chase me nigga
zig-zaggin' through the freeway
race me nigga
In a high speed chase with the law 
the realest muthafucka that you ever saw
I'm livin' raw 'til they bury me don't worry me
I'm high livin' like I ain't afraid to die
And you could walk a mile in my shoes
and you'd be crazy too
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Ain't no escape from a deadly fate
and everyday there's a million black bodies put away
I'm startin' to lose hope
it seems everybody's on dope
Mama told me to leave 'cause she was broke
Sometimes I choke on the indo
peepin' out the window alone on my own
I'm a criminal
Got no love from the household I'm out cold
in the streets give me muthafucking peace
I got nothing to lose
and something to prove
What do I do live Thug Life nigga stay true
I wonder when they kill me
is there a Heaven for a real G
Lord forgive me if you feel me
'Cause all my life I was dirt broke
with no hope li'l skinny muthafucka wantin' dough
I hated cutting suckers with my razor blade 
but everyday it's a struggle to get major paid
Anyway it's so hard on a nigga in this city
no pity and ain't no love for the scrubs that be buyin' time
If you could walk a mile in my shoes you'd be crazy too
with nothing to lose
[Chorus]

It was a what type nigga be a Thug Life nigga
We be the craziest...Muthafucka!
You know!
It was a what type nigga be a Thug Life nigga
We be the craziest!

Too many seeds in the trey bag
I'm on the train headin uptown, freestylin
with some wild kids from Bucktown, profilin
cause the hoochies was starin, thinkin, "Why them niggaz swearin?"
I'm wonderin if that's her hair, I remember
Stickball, pump the hoochies on the wall
or takin leaks on the steps, stinkin up the hall
Through my childhood, wild as a juvenile
A young nigga tryin to stay away from Riker's Isle
Me and my homies breakin nights, tryin to keep it true
Out on the roof sippin 90 proof, ain't nuttin like the old school

Sometimes its hard to wake up in the morning
Mind full of demons, I don't wanna hear them anymore
Got me heartbroken,fine, so many babies screaming
Cause they seeing destruction before they a see human being
So they start smoking weed, we'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape 
Cause they all broke. and why do ghetto birds die
Before we learn to fly, some bodies else's child caught in guns
Smoking weed, can all make a change
So I'm told, but I haven't seen the change unfold,
I keep hoping please, if you prefer to breathe, 
Communities in need of people that will lead
Keep your eyes open, I can only say I'll try
Until the day I die, I promise to be wise
With my heart open, greed, brings only misery
A way to tragedy, so I stay sucker free
Only a few chosen, rise (rise)
My ghetto queen, rise (rise)
Don't be afraid to try (try)
Too many of us died to the door to open wide
My brother be wise, stay focused on the prize
Though everybody dies
We can...
[Eminem]
Only learn to take, our anger and our hate
Control our mental state, settle down, and just set it straight
Maybe we can learn to take a second to pump the brakes
For we said it, regret it later, and let it escalate
Cause by then its too just late, theres so much we can take
Theres only so much someone can swallow and tolerate
To the point that he just breaks, snaps and thats all it takes
You'd think that we was learning from other rappers mistakes
But we aint
Its plain to go against, with every artists, comes the image he portrays
And a picture that he paints
But in the midst of all this anger and this angst
Never once did you hear me say I'm a gangster and I aint hear no complaints
But I know, that I will always continue to grow,
As long as I lead and never follow no one else's shadow
There will never be another me
And that I can guarantee
Thats why the fuck I remain sucker free to this day
The game will never be the same
No matter how much fame or success they attain 
There will never be another me
And no matter what they do
There will never be another you
You can search but you'll never find
You can try to rewind time
But in your hearts and your minds
We will never die
We are forever alive
And we continue growing....
[2pac]
One day at a time
Don't be caught in the publicity and caught in the hype
Rappers are regular people minus money and light
Searching for fortune and fame, and super stardom
All the jewelry, all the cars, whose crew is the hardest.
Now the hip-hop police, the villains is watching
And kids think beef is the only option
Outlaws born filthy, guilty as charged
My memories of Khaddafi, but Makaveli lives on
You think the industry is fun
And no pity with guns
And when your money is up
Thats when your enemies come
So if he died and came back
Would he try to save rap?
We needing a change, the drama remains
I spent my whole life, fighting myself
That I cant win so I'm inviting some help
and every now and then I take rights from left
Im still just like a kid, looking for stripes on my belt
And that there is a fight in itself
So I just pray and hope god
Take a like to myself
No matter how much I try (stay alive)
I'm gunna die mad, still standing there in love with my pride
Heard frivolous beats, we past that
I'm trying to keep some income coming in
And collect on my ass cap
The rappers in the game aint changed
And I finally realized that we not in the same game
The hating will never end, so I guess I'll deal wit it
Them 4-5 with cop killers, just some steel wit it
The streets is military, you gotta be a soldier
Gotta stay leery and keep your eyes on the rollers
As they do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us
So we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rolling
One way at a time, keep the faith in your mind
and we continue growin...
[2Pac]
...One day at a time. Damn!

Only Fear Of Death 
Pssst... psssssst... aiyyo
Are you afraid to die, or do you wanna live forever
Tell me, which one?
They wanna bury me, I'm worried -- I'm losin my mind
Look down the barrel of my nine and my vision's blurry
Fallin to pieces, am I guilty? I pray to the Lord
but he ignores me unfortunately cause I'm guilty
Show me a miracle, I'm hopeless -- I'm chokin off
marijuana smoke, with every toke it's like I'm losin focus
Fallin to sleep while I'm at service, when will I die?
Forever paranoid and nervous because I'm high
Don't mention funerals I'm stressin, and goin nutty
And reminiscin bout them niggaz that murdered my buddy
I wonder when will I be happy, ain't nothin funny
Flashbacks of bustin caps, anything for money
Where am I goin I discovered, can't nothin save me
My next door neighbor's havin convo with undercovers
Put a surprise in the mailbox, hope she get it
Happy birthday bitch, you know you shouldn'ta did it
Everybody's dyin am I next, who can I trust?
Will they be G's, and they look at me before they bust?
Or will they kill me while I'm sleepin, two to the head
while I'm in bed, leakin blood on my satin sheets
Is there a heaven for a baller? I'm gettin suspicious
of this bitch the line busy everytime I call her
Now she's tellin me to visit, who else is home?
I check the house before I bone, so we all alone
After I nut I hit the highway, see ya later
To all the players watch the fly way a nigga played her
The bitch is tellin all her homies -- that I can fuck her
like no other now them other bitches wanna bone me
I'm under pressure gettin drunk, somebody help me
I drink a fifth of Hennesey I don't think it's healthy
I see my enemies they creepin, don't make me blast
I watch the five-oh's roll, the motherfuckers pass
by me like they know me, smilin as they laugh
I put up my middle finger then I dash
Niggaz don't like me cause I'm Thuggin, and every day
I'm a hustler lookin to get paid
They wanna bury me, I'm worried -- no need to lie
I pray to God I don't scream when it's time to fry
Nowhere to rest I'm losin homies, ain't that a bitch
When I was rich I had clout, now a nigga's lonely
I put the pistol to my head, and say a prayer
I see visions of me dead, Lord are you there?
Then tell me am I lost cause I'm lonely
I thought I had friends but in the end a nigga dies lonely
Nowhere to run I'm in terror, and no one cares
A closed casket at my funeral and no one's there
Is there a future for a killer?  I change my ways
But still that don't promise me the next day
So I stay Thuggin with a passion, forever blastin
I'm bustin on these motherfuckers in my madness
They wonder if I'm hellbound... well Hell
can't be worse than this, cause I'm in Hell now
Don't make me hurt you I don't want to, but I will
Seen motherfuckers killed over phone bills
Never will I die, I'll be back
Reincarnated as a motherfuckin mack
I love it cause in heaven there's no shortage on G's
I'm tellin you now, you motherfuckers don't know me
"Only fear of death.."        
"You ghetto niggaz"
"Only fear of death is comin back reincarnated"
[repeats continously w/ variations]
Hahaha, I ain't scared to die
I ain't scared to die
To my homies in heaven
I ain't scared to die
Do you wanna live forever?
Are you scared, to die?
Or will you scream, when you fry?
I don't fear death
My only fear of death is comin back, reincarnated
This is dedicated to Mental, R.I.P.
And Big Kill, R.I.P.
And all you other O.G.'s, who go down
I don't fear death

Only God Can Judge Me 
(feat. Rappin 4-Tay)
[Intro: 2Pac]
Only God can judge me, is that right?
[synth voice]
 Only God can judge me now
Only God baby, nobody else, nobody else
All you other motherfuckers get out my business
[Verse One: 2Pac]
Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
I couldn't trust my own homies just a bunch a dirty rats
Will I, succeed, paranoid from the weed
And hocus pocus try to focus but I can't see
And in my mind I'ma blind man doin time
Look to my future cause my past, is all behind me
Is it a crime, to fight, for what is mine?
Everybody's dyin tell me what's the use of tryin
I've been Trapped since birth, cautious, cause I'm cursed
And fantasies of my family, in a hearse
And they say it's the white man I should fear
But, it's my own kind doin all the killin here
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make em wish I died
Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin for
Everybody's droppin got me knockin on heaven's door
And all my memories, of seein brothers bleed
And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
Recollect your thoughts don't get caught up in the mix
Cause the media is full of dirty tricks
Only God can judge me
[Chorus: 2Pac]
[synth voice]
 Only God can judge me
That's right baby, yeah baby
[synth voice]
 Only God
Hahahahahahahaha
[synth + Pac]
 Only God can judge me, only God can judge
[synth cont.]
 me, only God
Only God can judge me
[synth + Pac]
 Only God can judge me
And only God can
[synth voice]
 Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
[synth + Pac]
 Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me
[synth voice]
 Only God can judge me, only God
Only God can judge me
[synth voice]
 Only God can judge me now
[heart monitor: long beep]
Flatline!
[Verse Two: 2Pac]
I hear the doctor standing over me 
[heart monitor: beeping slowly]
screamin I can make it 
Got a body full of bullet holes layin here naked 
Still I, can't breathe, somethings evil in my IV
Cause everytime I breathe, I think they killin me 
[beeping sound stops]
I'm having nightmares, homicidal fantansies 
I wake up stranglin, danglin my bed sheets
I call the nurse cause it hurts, to reminisce
How did it come to this?  I wish they didn't miss 
Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
Cause even Thugs cry, but do the Lord care? 
Try to remember, but it hurts
I'm walkin through the cemetary talkin to the, dirt
I'd rather die like a man, than live like a coward 
There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours, Black Power
is what we scream as we dream in a paranoid state 
And our fate, is a lifetime of hate 
Dear Mama, can you save me?  And fuck peace
Cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat
No more hesitation each and every black male's trapped 
And they wonder why we suicidal runnin round strapped 
Mista, Po-lice, please try to see that it's
a million motherfuckers stressin just like me
Only God can judge me
[Chorus w/ variations]
[Interlude: 2Pac]
That which does not kill me can only make me stronger
(That's for real) 
and I don't see why everybody feel as though
that they gotta tell me how to live my life
(You know?)
Let me live baby, let me live
[Verse Three: Rappin 4-Tay, Tupac]
Pac I feel ya, keep servin it on the reala
For instance say a playa hatin mark is out to kill ya
Would you be wrong, for buckin a nigga to the pavement?
He gon' get me first, if I don't get him fool start prayin
Ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law
So judge us when we get to where we're goin wearin a cross, that's real
Got him, lurked him, crept the fuck up on him
Sold a half a million tapes now everybody want him
After talkin behind my back like a bitch would
Tellin them niggaz, "You can fade him," punk I wish you would
It be them same motherfuckers in your face that'll rush up in your place
to get your safe, knowin you on that paper chase 
Grass, glass, big screen and leather couch
My new shit is so fetti already sold a key of ounce
Bitch, remember Tupac and 4-Tay
Them same two brothers dodgin bullets representin the Bay
Pac when you was locked down, that's when I'll be around
Start climbing up the charts, so sick, but they tried to clown 
That's why they ride the bandwagon still be draggin sellin lies
Don't think I don't see you haters, I know you all in disguise
Guess you figure you know me cause I'm a Thug
That love to hit the late night club, drink then buzz
Been livin lavish like a player all day 
Now I'm bout to floss em off, player shit with 4-Tay
Only God can judge me
[Chorus w/ variations]
[4Tay]
 Only God main
[2Pac]
 That right?
[4Tay]
 That's real
[2Pac]
 Hahahahahaha
[4Tay]
 Fuck everybody else, yaknowhatI'msayin?
[2Pac]
 Man, look here man
My only fear of death is comin back to this bitch reincarnated
That's for the homey mental
We up out
[Chorus w/out 2Pac continues to fade]

Open Fire 
"Alright now, here we go"
[Verse One: 2Pac]
Tell me, how many real motherfuckers feel me? I smoke a blunt
and freak the funk until these jealous motherfuckers kill me
I'm out the gutter, pick a hero
I'm 165 and staying high til I die, my competion's zero
Cause I could give a fuck about you, better duck
Or I'll be forced to hit yo ass up I give a fuck
I'm sick inside my mind, why you sweatin me?
It's gonna take an army full of crooked ass cops to come and get me
Niggaz know I ain't the one to sleep on, I'm under pressure
Gotta sleep with my piece, an extra clip beside my dresser
Word to God I've been ready to die since I was born
I don't want no shit but niggaz trip and yo it's on
Open fire on my adversaries, don't even worry
Better have on a vest aim for the chest and then you buried
It's a man's world, niggaz get played, another stray
Hope I live to see another day, hey
I'm getting sweated by these undercovers, who can I trust?
Got my mama stressin thinkin it's a drug bust
Gotta get paid but all the drama that's attached
We living a Drug Life, Thug Life, each day could be my last
Will I blast when it's time to shoot? Don't even ask
That's the consequences when ya livin, fast
Six bricks of tricks, for my niggaz, I gotta come up
and recoup, you keep the dope just bring me six figures
Is it a bust? I hear the sirens, run for cover
over the fence and open fire
"Alright now, here we go"
[Verse Two: 2Pac]
These motherfuckers on my ass I'm in traffic, will it be tragic?
I'm comin round the corner like I'm Magic
Doin ninety on the freeway, and hittin switches
In a high speed chase with these punk bitches
Don't turn around I ain't givin up, cause they don't worry me
Pussy ass bitches better bury me
Runnin outta gas time to park it, I'm on foot
We in the hood, how the fuck they gon catch a crook? Haha
I got away cause I'm clever
Went to my neighbors for a favor now you know players stick together
I watch the scene from the rooftop, spittin loogies
at the coppers that persue me, beotch!
I be a hustler til it's over, motherfucker
Open fire on you bustas
"Alright now, here we go"
[Verse Three: 2Pac]
Don't try to follow me, I'm headed outta state
I gotta pay my fuckin bills, so I'm transportin weight
Change my plates, pick up my nigga, and now we rollin
Droppin keys like they stolen, hehe
Tell me who do you fear?  I'm outta town until the coast is clear
Enough dope to last a year
They got me running from the police, nowhere to go
With the lights out, rollin down a dirt road
But I ain't goin alive, I'd rather die than be a convict
I'd rather fire on my target
I hit the corner doing ninety, ahhhh shit!
Them bitches right behind me
They take a shot and hit my fuckin tires
Now, jump out the car then I open fire, sucka!
Hahahaha, Thug Life!

Out On Bail 
[Intro: Tupac Talking]
Oh, I posted bail?
I'm out this motherfucker?
I can go?
Oh, fuck y'all eh, fuck the judge
Fuck the motherfuckin' district attourney and the prosecutor (fuck you!)
And fuck you motherfuckers in the jury box (fuck you!)
Fuck all y'all

Drop that shit em!
Let these old punk ass bitches know how we runnin' this shit
Niggaz ain't going back to court you stank ass bitches
[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Im stuck in jail the DA's tryin' to burn me
I'd be out on bail if I had a good attorney
Wanna label me a criminal and cuff me up
Got a pocket full of money so they rough me up
I ain't trippin' in the county and I'm mad as fuck
Got a record so they put me with the baddest bunch
Everybody wanna talk cause I'm rappin'
They askin' me what happened
Is it true you did a flick with Janet Jackson
I can't sleep they takin' polaroids
And I'm tryna to use the phone but they makin' noise
Man I wish I had my glock cause its major
I'm makin' shanks out the plastics in razors
These motherfuckers won't leave me alone thats my word
Bout to turn a violation to a motherfuckin' murder
I'm makin' collect calls to my old bitches
Send mo' pictures and make me some more riches
To all the suckers on the block talkin' shit while I was locked up
Be prepared to get socked up
Cause the game is deep and the fame is brief
And you bullshittin' bitches ain't changin' me
I came straight up out the gutta I was saved from hell
I'm a thug I was raised in jail
Now I'm out on bail
[Chorus x1]
Out on Bail (You know what fuckin' time it is)
ThugLife will never fail (I'm out on bail)
Thuglife niggaz (I'm going straight to 50,000 BIATCH!!!)
Thuglife niggaz (I'm out on bail)
Out on Bail (Hey, hand me some motherfuckin' Colt 40's from the fridge nigga)
ThugLife will never fail (Cause I'm out on bail)
Thuglife niggaz (Hey, pass me my motherfuckin' Rolex)
Thuglife niggaz (Yes bitch that's a President)
[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Stuck in jail and mad as a bitch
I'd be out on bail if it wasn't for the snitch
Runnin' wild thru the streets like I'm loco
And fuck the punk police and they chokeholds
I got no love in my heart cause I'm heartless
Mobbin' in the park after dark wanna start shit
Rippin' up the scene as a teen I was at it (but hey)
And sellin' products to the addicts cause they gotta have it
I was a well-known thug and I gotta lotta love
Hangin out with the OG's shootin' up the clubs
And mama told me don't hang with the homies
But they got me if they need me then it's on G
Got me sittin' in the cell a five by seven
Will I finally get to go to ghetto heaven
Got my bitches on the outside writin' me letters
And they tell me they love me and the shit ull get better
I don't believe her cause I just got the news on the wire
Take it how you want it but your bitch is on fire
I gotta be a player so I stay strong
cause I know that I won't be away long
and when I finally do hit the fuckin' streets I'ma handle this
A thug nigga gettin' scandalous
I'm on bail
[Chorus x1]
Out on Bail
ThugLife (see) will never fail (Out on bail - biatch!)
Thuglife niggaz (You know what time it is)
Thuglife niggaz (I'm out on bail)
Out on Bail (Y'all don't need to know about...)
ThugLife will never fail (You know, Out on bail)
Thuglife niggaz (Y'all Blow that shit - Get me up out this)
Thuglife niggaz (Yo, EM!!! Get me up out of this motherfucker man!)
Out on Bail (These motherfuckers are harrasing me and that ain't cool)
[Outro: Tupac Talking]
Out on bail

What do you know about Pac's life 
(What do you know? What do you know?) 
(Only real niggas stay on top) 
Everybody talking 'bout Pac's life 
(Outlawz) 
[Verse One: Tupac]
It Started with five shots, niggas plotting to kill him 
Never figured that, that same nigga sell five million 
Hit the charts like a mad man nothing but hits 
Court cases got a nigga facing multiple digits 
Dodging cop cars look how we come so far 
Picture a high school drop out 
Rolling a double R 
House full of happiness, weed and drank 
Way out 
So when trouble tried to find me can't 
Never visioned living longer than my twenty first 
Thought I'd locked down, cracked out or in the dirt 
And though it hurts to see the change 
It comes with the fame 
Watch them gossip in this silly game 
To all the motherfucker's speaking down on me this is the night 
Why's everybody caught up In Pac's life? 
To all y'all niggas 
Conversating on my life 
Mind your motherfucking business 
[Chorus]
[Verse Two: T.I]
I remember that 
Ay 
What's happening Pac 
Yeah I know we never to meet 
But we know all the same people so we got to speak 
You taught me first, fake nigga can't stop a G 
And all the shit you went through 
Meant a lot to me 
But watched you locked you up for for nothing  was shame to see 
You we know the crack came and did the same thing to me 
I get along with real niggas it's the lane to be 
Talking loud out of pocket tryna bang with me 
And so I pull it out my pocket let it rain you see 
Now they all in the court room blaming me 
See we ain't live the same life but represent the same struggle 
Power to the real niggas death to the sucker's 
Money over bitches, get to know 'em for you love 'em 
Death before dishonour never talk to undercover's 
Live by the same rules so I minus the tattoo's 
With the same sort of dude with he same short fuse 
[Chorus]
[Verse Three: Tupac]
I want money in large amounts 
My garage full of cars that bounce 
Moving my tapes in major weight cause every dollar counts 
Busters is jealous and half these niggas is punks 
They running off at the mouth till I fill it up with my pump 
They jump my automatic keep 'em weary 
While you fronting like you Billy Bad Ass 
Nigga you scary 
I been knowing you for years 
We was high school peers 
In Junior High 
I was itching' to kill 
And you was, 'Ready To Die' 
While you bullshitting niggas was dying and catching cases 
Busting my automatics at motherfucker's in foreign places 
Leaving no trace, they see my face and then they buried 
Bitches die in a hurry 
Still I ride, I'm never worried 
Mr. Makaveli tell me to ride and I'ma ride 
Pick my enemies out the crowd 
And motherfucker's die 
It's not the way I wanna live 
My nigga it's how it is 
Only real niggas stay on top 
[Chorus]
Why are all you niggas all up in my shit? 
Tell them motherfucker's 
Outlawz 
Fuck all y'all

Panther Power 
[Tupac]
As real as it seems the American Dream
Ain't nothing but another calculated schemes
To get us locked up shot up back in chains
To deny us of the future rob our names
Kept my history of mystery but now I see
The American Dream wasn't meant for me
Cause lady liberty is a hypocrite she lied to me
Promised me freedom, education, equality
Never gave me nothing but slavery
And now look at how dangerous you made me
Calling me a mad man cause I'm strong and bold
With this dump full of knowledge of the lies you told
Promise me emancipation indispute nation
All you gave my people was our patience
Fathers of our country never cared for me
They kept my answer shackled up in slavery
And Uncle Sam never did a dam thing for me
Except lie about the facts in my history
So now I'm sitting hear mad cause I'm unemployed
But the government's glad cause they enjoyed
When my people are down so they can screw us around
Time to change the government now panther power
[Chorus]
Panther power
Panther power
Panther power
[Tyson]
Coming straight that resides within
Go toe to toe with a panther and you just can't win
Suffered fame bats suppressed the rest
The rich get richer and the poor can't last
The American Dream was an American nightmare
You kept my people down and refuse to fight fair
The Klu Klux Klan tried to keep us out
Besides drew they know no blacks allowed
With intimidation and segregation was a way for our freedom
But now were impatient
Blacks the other skin: dead or sell outs
Freedom, equality, then I'll yell out
"Don't you ever be ashamed of what you are
It's ya panther power that makes you a star"
Panther power
[Chorus]
Panther power
Panther power
Panther power
[Tupac]
My Mother never let me forget my history
Hoping I was set free chains never put on me
Wanted to be more than just free
Had to know the true facts about my history
I couldn't settle for being a statistic
Couldn't survive in this capitalistic
Government cause it was meant to hold us back
Using ignorant, drugs, to sneak attack
In my community think of unity
But when I charged them, tried to claim immunity
I strike America like a case of hard disease
Panther power is running through my arteries
Try to stop oh boy you'll be clawed to death
Cause I'll be fighting for my freedom with my dying breath
Do you remember that is what I'm asking you?
You think you living free don't let me laugh at you
Open your eyes realize that you have been locked in chains
Said you wasn't civilized and stole your name
Cause some time has passed seem you all forget
There ain't no liberty to you and me we all ain't free yet
Panter power
[Chorus]
Panther power
Panther power
Panther power
[Tupac]
As real as it seems the American Dream
Ain't nothing but another calculated schemes

(feat. Wycked)
Daddy's home...
[2Pac]
Heh, so?
You say that like that means somethin to me
You've been gone a mighty long motherfuckin time
for you to be comin home talkin that "daddy's home" shit (nigga)
We been gettin along fine just without you
Me, my brother, and my mother
So if you don't mind, you can step the FUCK off, POPS.. fuck you!
[2Pac]
Had to play catch by myself, what a sorry sight
A pitiful plight, so I pray for a starry night
Please send me a pops before puberty
the things I wouldn't do to see a piece of family unity
Moms always work, I barely see her
I'm startin to get worried without a pops I'll grow to be her
It's a wonder they don't understand kids today
so when I pray, I pray I'll never grow to be that way
And I hope that he answers me
I heard God don't like ugly well take a look at my family
A different father every weekend
Before we get to meet him they break up before the week ends
I'm gettin sick of all the friendships
As soon as we kick it he done split and the whole shit ends quick
How can I be a man if there's no role model?
Strivin to save my soul I stay cold drinkin a forty bottle
I'm so sorry...
[Chorus]
I'm so sorry
for all this time (I'm so sorry)
for all this time
for all this time (don't lie)
I'm so sorry
for all this time (so, sorry)
for all this time
for all this time, so sorry baby!
[Wycked]
Moms had to entertain many men
Didn't wanna do it but it's time to pay the rent again
I'm gettin a bit older and I'm startin to be a bother
Moms can't stand me cause I'm lookin like my father
Should I stay or run away, tell me the answer
Moms ignores me and avoids me like cancer
Grow up rough and it's hard to understand stuff
Moms was tough cause his poppa wasn't man enough
Couldn't stand up to his own responsibilities
Instead of takin care of me, he'd rather live lavishly
That's why I'll never be a father;
unless you got the time it's a crime don't even bother
(That's when I started hatin the phony smiles
 Said I was an only child)
Look at mama's lonely smile
It's hard for a son to see his mother cry
She only loves you, but has to fuck with these other guys
I'm so sorry...
[Chorus]
I'm so sorry
for all this time
for all this time
for all this time
I'm so sorry
for all this time
for all this time (so sorry)
for all this time, so sorry baby!
[2Pac]
Man child in the promised land couldn't afford many heroes
Moms was the only one there my pops was a no-show
And ohh -I guess ya didn't know 
that I would grow to be so strong
Lookin kinda pale, was it the ale oh pops was wrong
Where was the money that you said, you would send me
talked on the phone and you sounded so friendly
Ask about school and my welfare
but it's clear, you ain't sincere hey who the hell cares
You think I'm blind but this time I see you comin, Jack
You grabbed your coat, left us broke, now ain't no runnin back
Ask about my moms like you loved her from the start
Left her in the dark, she fell apart from a broken heart
So don't even start with that "wanna be your father" shit
Don't even bother with your dollars I don't need it
I'll bury moms like you left me all alone G
Now that that I finally found you, stay the Fuck away from me
You're so sorry..
[Chorus]
I'm so sorry (so sorry)
for all this time (so, so sorry)
for all this time (I'm so so sorry)
for all this time (fuck that!)
I'm so sorry
for all this time (no)
for all this time (so sorry)
for all this time, so sorry baby!
[Tupac - impersonating his father]
I never meant to leave but I was wanted
Crossed too many people every house I'd touch was haunted
Had to watch the strangers every brother was in danger
If I was to keep you breathin, had to be out of range-a
Had to move, one to lost my name and pick the number
Made me watch my back I had no happy home to run to
Maybe it's my fault for being a father livin fast
But livin slow, mean half the dough, and you won't get no ass
Hindsight shows me it was wrong all along
I wanted to make some dough so you would grow to be so strong
It took a little longer than I thought
I slipped, got caught, and sent to jail by the courts
Now I'm doin time and I wish you'd understand
all I ever wanted was for you to be a man
and grow to be the type you was meant to be
Keep the war fightin by the writings that you sent to me
I'm so sorry...
[Chorus w/ variations til end]

Part Time Mutha 
[cutting and scratching]
She's a part time
a part time
part time
She's a (part time mutha)
A part time
A part time
part time
She's a (part time mutha)
Meet Cindi, she's twenty-two, lives right on the dope track
Used to be fat now weighs less than a Tic-Tac
Now what's that say about, this big epidemic
This hypocritical world, and the people in it
Now speaking of in it Cindi loved to get buckwild
Fuck with a smile single file she'll bust nuff styles
That would be cool, if she was your lover
But fuck that, Cindi was my dope fiend mother
Welfare checks never stepped through the front door
Cuz moms would run to the dopeman once more
All those days, had me fiending for a hot meal
Now I'm a crook, got steel, I do not feel
So don't even trip, when I flip, with my thirty-eight
Revenge is a bitch, and my hit shake the murder rate
Word to the mutha, I'm touched
When moms come by, niggaz hush or get rushed
Maybe one day she'll recover
But what will it take, to shake, or break
My part time mutha
I gotta live with a part time
A part time
A part time
She's a (part time mutha)
A part time
A part time
She's a (part time mutha)
I grew up in a home where no-one liked me
Moms would hit the pipe, everynight, she would fight me
Poppa was a nasty old man, like the rest
He's feeling on my chest, with his hand in my dress
Just another pest, and yes I was nervous
Blood sensor tests, I just don't deserve this
I wanna tell mom, but would she listen
She's bound to be bitchin if she hasn't got a fix in
So... now I lay me down to sleep
Lord don't let him rape me
If he does my soul to keep
Don't let the devil take me
Can't concentrate I contemplate in my classroom
Thinkin how my step dad, raped me in the bathroom
Every day I make class, and yet I'm missing periods
The thought of pregnancy is in my head and now I'm fearing it
I gotta tell mom, before she sees me
I told her how he G'd me, and she didn't believe me
Callin me a slut cuz my butt's kinda big so
Still that ain't no way to be talkin to your kids though
I can't believe the way you call it
Gotta believe in him, and dissin her own daughter
Time for me to break and find another
That's when I discovered
The ways of the days of a part time mutha
I got a part time
A part time
A part time
She's a (part time mutha)
Part time
A part time
A part time mutha
She's a (part time mutha)
I rush to tend her, talked as I touch her
She blushed, the clothes came off, and I bust her
I'm up now, ready to get drunk on the block
Here, take a cab, thanks a lot for the cot
She's gone, and I'm thinkin that my game's so strong
Pat myself on the back and move on
Is this just how it is hell no
Cuz she came back with the kid and yo
I been payin ever since
The clothes the food the cars and oh the rent
All of my time gets spent at the workplace
No time to kiss her got me list in the first place
So I do the dishes and clean the floor
When I sleep I can't dream anymore
Oh no... now I'm a part time mutha
And I, change the diapers and clean the shit
The tables are turned I can't take this
Oh no... now I'm a part time mutha
A part time
A part time mutha
Now I'm a part time mutha
I'm a (part time mutha)
A part time
A part time
Part time
Now I'ma (part time mutha)
She's a part time
A part time mutha
He's a part time mutha
She's a (part time mutha)
A part time
A part time
A part time
Part time mutha

Don't these niggas know that neiter one of y'all can fade me.

Fat gold ropes.
Gotta keep a low key for my attack.
When I approach, I want the diamonds, the pearls.
The round the way girls.
Cuz baby got, baby got back out this world.
Would you give a fee? Never.
Fly like a feather.
Make more money than your father and your mother put together.
The game is to be sold, not to be told.
So buy it.
Can't afford it?
Low budget hoes gotta brother.
Peep game.
[Chorus repeats]
Don't sell out.

(feat. CPO, Danny Boy, Syke)
[2Pac]
Yeah -- clear enough for ya?  (Is that right?)

Y'all supposed to be happy I'm free!
Y'all niggaz look like y'all wanted me to stay in jail, hahah!
Hoe bustaz
Picture me rollin in my 500 Benz
I got no love for these niggaz, there's no need to be friends
They got me under surveillance, that's what somebody be tellin
Know there's dope bein sold, but +I+ ain't the one sellin!
Don't want to be another number
I got a fuckin gang of weed to keep from goin under
The federales wanna see me dead - niggaz put prices on my head
Now I got two Rottwillers by me bed, I feed em lead
Now I'm released, how will I live?  Will God forgive me 
for all the dirt a nigga did, to feed kids?
One life to live, it's so hard to be positive
when niggaz shootin at your crib
Mama, I'm still thuggin, the world is a war zone
My homies is inmates, and most of them dead wrong
Full grown, finally a man, just scheamin on ways 
to put some green inside the palms of my empty hands
Just picture me rollin
Flossin a Benz on rims that isn't stolen
My dreams is censored, my hopes are gone
I'm like a fiend that finally sees when all the dope is gone
My nerves is wrecked, heart beatin and my hands is swollen
thinkin of the G's I'll be holdin, picture me rollin
Can you see me now?  Heheheh
Move to the side a little bit so you can get a CLEAR picture
Can you see it?  Hahah
Pictue me rollin
Yeah nigga!
Ay but peep how my nigga Syke do it to you
Guess who's back?
[Syke]
I got ki's, comin from overseas
Cost a nigga two hundred G's
I'm a street comando, Nino for example
This lavish lifestyle is hard to handle
So I got to floss cause I'm more like a boss playa
Thug, branded to be a women layer
So mny playa haters, imitaters steady swangin
Make me wanna start back bangin
So I'm caught up in the game, dress code changed
Packin forty glocks, contain em or rearrange
All that jealousy and envy comin from my enemies
While I'm sippin on Re-mi
in front of black Lexus, Chevy's on the roam
Ninety-six big body, sittin on chrome
As we head up out the zone, stone-facin is on
You can admire, but don't look too long
I'm livin a dream with triple beams and my pockets bulgin
It's hard to imagine -- picture me rollin!
[Danny Boy]
Picture, picture me, picture me rollin
Rollin, picture me rollin
Wheelin, picture me rollin in
Picture me yea yeah
[CPO]
Mmm, I gots to get the fuck up in it, formulate a caper
Cause a nigga straight sufferin from lack of havin paper
My bitch fin' to have a bastard, see?
So I needs to hit a lick, drastically
I see some baldin-ass niggaz and they slippin in my spot
And, uh, diggin the plots (so what?)
Checkin in the park, 'Pac
[2Pac]
We caught em sleepin, he didn't peep you niggaz creepin?
This how we do it every weekend
I dump for madness, it's time to count the profit

This crooked shit that we inflictin gettin street sales
[CPO]
Move smooth as a motherfucker, me and my nine

Now we satisfied, got the pockets on swollen

Another shady mission, tricks, like watchin pictures in hazy vision
Tonight is love makin, take you any place you wish
Today we satisfied, and today we stole them kisses
Blind insanity, perfect pictures of me and my family
Not understanding it definitely, if they plan for me
If I have kids, will I live to see them grow?
Though I don't know, I live the life of a thug nigga
Until the day I go, no broken promises
A sacred bond broken, I know I die alone
But yet and still I'm hopin
Visions of prisons, maybe I'll be forgiven
I know it's better in heaven 'cause bein here ain't livin
Close my eyes and see nothing but pain, the world is crazy, still
Lookin for a queen to plant seeds and have babies
Maybe I'll be the one or just maybe I'm lost
You'll never know being cautious, if you playa cardz right

You got a brother feelin mellow like a Cuban cigar
You truly a star, we'll take the days one at a time
I think we make the perfect pair, cause you my one of a kind
I say we make a full house, live out the family dreams
No jokers, no jacks, just kings and queens
And we should leave the clubs alone and take trips to islands
Give you all of my heart and flood your hands with diamonds
No more livin like a player, stop chasin the hoes
I never put you in a shuffle, use my ace in the hole
I live a life full of riches we got places to go
So no bluffin, no rushin, just takin it slow
Let your man do the hustling while you lay in the shade
I'll throw a deuce to the haters, call a spade a spade
And let you know I'll never hurt you, babygirl

I thought I hit rock bottom, they ban my album, point the finga
I guess nobody loves a real nigga-slash-rap singer
I thought I'd bring a little truth to the young troops
I brought proof that the niggaz need guns too
It's not to be a racist, but let's face this:
wouldn't you if we could trade places?
I got lynched by some crooked cops, and to this day
them same motherfuckers on the beat gettin major paid
But when I get my check they takin tax out
So, we payin for these pigs to knock the blacks out
Ain't that a bitch, some officers are gettin rich
Whoopin on thugs and robbin drug dealers for they shit
As far as jealousy, bein a celebrity
No matter who committed the crime, they all yell at me
And the media is greedier than most
You could sell em your soul or they'll be on ya til a niggaz ghost
And everyday I read the paper there's another lie
They show my picture for the crimes of another guy
Now how's that for the life of a big shot
A dead cop, a law suit, a little kid shot
I play them nuttin ass marks in the park
for tryin to earn they stripes in the dark
Just cause I come there, don't mean I from there, peep:
only jealous motherfuckers beef, and point the finga
[Chorus: repeat 4X]
Boom boom boom on your black ass, bitch
[1]
 [2]
[2Pac]
As I run up on em madman, a nutcase with a screw loose
A zoot troupe full of foolies with toolies
Niggaz run to me don't come to me with beef
Take your jewels and your jeep, boom boom!  Let that ass sleep
It's gettin hectic, niggaz run, quick
Buckshots are the payback for dumb shit
All you niggaz on the block tryin to test me
Best wear a vest or get open like, sesame
I'll run up on you mad deep; while you're tryin to sleep
I'm steady pumpin bullets in your sheets
Wake up, motherfucker, don't stutter
Point blank by a nigga from the gutter, yeah!
Gimme mine, gimme mine, gimme, mine
Ban my rhymes, now I'm back to bustin, nines
And bustaz can't get none, hell no
A quick flurry and he's buried with a swelled jaw
I came up from the amateurs to pro hits
at 5-0, so you know I take no shit
And everybody wants to kill a bringer
of bad news, so they choose, to point the finga
[Chorus]
[2Pac]
One two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, til these motherfuckers kill me
I bring skills and I build, kill at will
Smoke sess til I'm ill, still feel me?
I say one two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, til these motherfuckers kill me
Pick it up, pick it up, give it up
Best to duck or get fucked for your bucks
Scream one two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, til these motherfuckers kill me
I can't give up, it's a black thang
And I ain't goin back to the crack game
(You can do it son; be a man and stand up or run)
Bitches, let em point the finga
(You can do it son; be a man and stand up or run)
Snitches, let em point the finga
Yo, one two three, peace to the real G's
Still me, til these motherfuckers kill me
I guess nobody loves a rap singer
That's why these motherfuckers.. (hahaha!) point the finga

Why'd you sland crack? Cuz I had to
A nigga gotta pay the fuckin bills
[Verse 1 (Tupac)]
Crazy, I gotta look at what you gave me, claimin I'ma criminal when you the one that made me
They got me trapped in this slavery
now I'm lost in the holocaust headin for my grave G
I told Sam he could fuck the war, and got a busted jaw for sayin "fuck the law"
And if you wonder why I'm mad, check the record
Whats a nigga gotta do to get respected
Sometimes I think I'm getting tested, and if I don't say "yes" a nigga quick to get arrested
That's the reason I stay zestin(??), I keep a vest on my chest incase the cops is getting
restless
Walkin round ready to light shit up, because my life is fucked, some say I'm slightly nuts
Buck buck is the sound as I move up, other niggas pay attention when a fool bust
They make a nigga be a killer, I used to be a dealer but they wanted to see whos realer
Now them same mother fuckas wanna murder me, and I wonder if the lord ever heard of me
I need loot, so I'm doin what I do, and don't say shit until you've walked in my shoes,
Theres no other destiny to choose, I had nothing left to lose, so I'm singin the po nigga blues
[Hook]
[Verse 2 (Tupac)]
Coppin these brand new shoes, but what the fuck can a nigga do, my little boy gotta eat too
So why must I sock a fella? Just live large like rocafella
And did you ever stop to think? I'm old enough to go to war but I aint old enough to drink
Cops wanna hit me with the book, and you hooked on my "I don't give a fuck" look
Makin rules, I'ma break em, no matter how much you make em, show me bakin, I'ma take em
So don't you ever temp me, I'm a fool for mine nigga, and my pockets stay empty
To my brother in the barrio, you livin worse then the niggas in ghetto so
I give a fuck about your language or complexion, you got love for the niggas in my section
You got problems with the punk police, don't run from the chumps, get the pump from me
We aint free, I'll be damned if I played a chip for a blonde haired blue eyed Caucasian bitch
Down with my home boy rich, fuck a snitch and groupie ass bitch
And a nigga with a cellular phone, leave his baby at home so he can go out and bone(huh)
And you wonder why we blazin niggas, cuz you punks haven babies cant raise the niggas
And they damned to be fuck ups too, drink 40s of brew, singin the nigga blues
[Hook]
Why'd you sland crack? Cuz I had to
Why'd you sland crack? Cuz I had to
Why'd you sland crack? Cuz I had to
And now I'm headin for the mother fuck in PEN

How you come up man?
I started young kickin dust and, livin rough
You watch you mouth around my mama you couldn't cuss man
I had a down ass homie though; we ran the streets
And on the scene at the age of fourteen, huh
I packed a nine and my nigga packed a forty-five
We drinkin forties, lil' shorties livin naughty lives
You couldn't stop us, long as I got my glock, FUCK the coppers 
Hangin on the block, slangin rocks and makin profits
I couldn't fuck with the schhhoooollll life, I was a fool
I'll play that motherfucker for a toooollll man
Tonight'll be the night that's what we figurin
Hustlin in the rain felt no pain cause we drinkin
Playin them hoes like manure
First let my nigga fuck and then I fuck that's how we do it (ha ha!)
It's two niggaz comin up out the hood
livin life just as good as we could
But since a bitch can't be trusted 
Hoes snitched to the po-lice, now my nigga's busted

And couldn't nobody diss my nigga
Damn, I miss my nigga
Pour out a little liquor!

Pour out a little liquor
Pour out a little liquor
What's that you drinkin on?
Drinkin on gin, smokin on blunts and it's on 
Reminisce about my niggaz, that's dead and gone
And now they buried, sometimes my eyes still get blurry
Cause I'm losin all my homies and I worry
I got my back against a brick wall, trapped in a circle
Boxin with them suckers til my knuckles turn purple 
Mama told me, "Son there'll be days like this"
Don't wanna think so -- I hit the drink and stay blitzed
We had plans of bein big time G's
Rolling in marked cars, movin them keys
And now I roll up the window, blaze up some indo
Get to' down for my niggaz in the pen, yo
Your son's gettin big and strong 
and I'd love'm like one of my own, til you come home and
the years sure fly with the quickness
You do the time, and I'll keep handlin yo' business
That's the way it's supposed to be 
Homie, if it was me, you'd do the shit for me
Homie, I can remember scrapin back to back
Throwin dogs on them suckers runnin up on this young hog
I hope my words can paint a perfect picture
And let ya know how much a nigga miss ya
Pour out some liquor!
"My cousin died last year and I still can't let go"
Look at you
Drinkin got you where you don't even give respect to your partners

[RR]
What's happenin baby, you know how we do it

[PAC]
Nah nah nah, we got to show these motherfuckers whassup though
[RR]
This is for the honeys, the super ?
[PAC]
I don't want to be her man, I want to be her nigga
You feel me?
[RR]
Well let em know
[Verse One: 2Pac, Richie Rich]
You fuckin wit niggaz that's insecure, watered down, my shit is pure
Write down my number but don't call me til you sure
I ain't beggin just tryin to relocate between ya legs
Drippin wet, as we experiment in sweaty sex
When you met me you wouldn't let me, and now
you straight beggin to sex me got you undressin to test me and uhh..
Shut me down if ya want, and miss the chance to do it live
When I stroll by, I see that look in yo' eye
You want a nigga, but think that you can't have a nigga
Don't cheat yourself, instead treat yourself
If you scared go to church, I know it hurts
To find out me and your man be sharin skirts
I hopin you don't take this the wrong way
But your body is bangin got me attracted in a strong way
After a long day of tryin to make my songs pay
Makin love all day against the wall in the hallway
Ya fantasies come alive, ya heart rate
shall increase when we meet up in this dark place
You might think you're happy with him
but that's a lie, so give this Thug a try
I'd rather be ya nigga
[Chorus: 2Pac]
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A
So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a Thug in your life
Cause busters ain't lovin you right
[repeat 2X]
[Verse Two: 2Pac, Richie Rich]
Look, now you was sprung from the introduction
My conversation's full of game yet laced with seductions
I see ya blushin like ya want somethin, come get a taste
of Amerikaz Most Wanted and let's get into some touchin, erotic fuckin
My up and down with no interruptions
have no intentions of bustin until you learn ya lesson
Now many questions are often asked, a drop top, 500 Benz
and plenty cash, to help a nigga get the ass
You can ride out the spoke coke, to get your lobster and crab
Cause all I got is conversation and a gang of stab
and I'ma listen when it hurts, I'ma hang out but never stay
Smoke blunts but leave them stunts up to Super Dave
I'll be your nigga, as long as we can understand
that I's the nigga whose spoke coke can be the man
He wine and dine, but me and you we whine and grind
And when I'm on the field keep him on the sidelines
[Chorus]
[Verse Three: 2Pac, Richie Rich]
Now it's time for the moment of truth, I got ya naked
Totally sweatin, let's see how hot I can make it
Tongue kissin til yo' head swang, I'm so into you
Witness a nigga make the bed bang
If it's all mine, then let me know, now scream my name out
Do you want it fast or shall I hit it slow?
Not to mention, the multiple positions I inflict
A boss playa, freaky motherfucker, can I dick
Uhh, it's on and poppin, now you seed what I was seein
Why yo' eyes rollin, Luke seen ya girl I ain't goin
nowhere, let's let that sucker stay out there
While he's stresed out and knock I stretch out the cock
Hold da boots, and let da nigga execute
And though you got it right, I'm goin home tonight
You say you don't need a man, but I don't care
You in the presence of a playa, I'd rather be ya nigga
[Chorus 2.25X]

Hear me!  Boo-yaow!
(Ready for whatever, hell yeah
What type nigga be a Thug Life nigga?
Them Thug Life niggaz be the craziest -- run up nigga!)
[2Pac]
There's no way to survive in the city it's a shame
Niggaz die from my hollow-point bullet to the brain
Will I survive or will I die is what I wonder
Puffin on blunts and gettin drunk to keep from goin under
Gettin lost in the madness, blunted gettin tipsy
Got my pistol out the window screamin, "Lord come and get me"
Am I sick, or am I just another victim?
Unloadin my clip, I'm watchin every bullet spit when I kick em
Niggaz die from automatic gunfire
Your time to expire, nobody cry every man gotta die
When they bury me, they bury me a G
Rest in peace, to all the homies got to heaven before me
Pour some liquor on the curb for the niggaz that's caught
Had a motherfuckin ward but he didn't go to court
God damn, and one day we'll all be together
Until then I'm ready for whatever, c'mon
(Yeah, niggaz movin somethin in the nine-trey
It's all about makin money, gettin yours
And knockin coppers off the motherfuckin planet
Word to the motherfuckin nine nigga
We gonna make this motherfucker ours
If they don't feel me, they gon kill me
So Syke, get skanless nigga)
[Big Syke]
Am I going to Hell or will I reach Heav-en? (hell naw)
After all this shit I did with my Mac-11
Did I sell my soul?  Mama woulda saved me
That's the way that daddy raised me
Oh God, help me I'm losin it
So fuck it!  Take me I'm doin it!
I need to change and look for a better way
I got a hundred round clip to my AK
Commitin sins I might die in vain
So fuck it!  We'll live off the street fame!
God didn't send me in the right direction
I'm gettin hit by a diesel in the intersection
I know you're out there help a young brother (hear me)
Til then I'ma smoke motherfuckers
Things wouldn't be so bad
if we got the things that we never had, I'm ready for whatever
(Hahahahaha, that's my motherfuckin nigga there
Big ballin-ass Syke
Yeah nigga, you schooled them young bustas
on how it is to be a real motherfuckin G
In the nine-trey motherfuckers is dyin daily so you best be packin
If you ain't, boo-yaow motherfucker!)
[2Pac]
Dear mama I know you worry cause I'm hardly at home
Every other night in jail, got you patient by the phone
Wanna shake it cause I can't take it got me livin in Hell
Like I'm walkin with a secret that'll kill me if I tell
I live the Thug Life and can't nobody, change me
Not to the brain, going insane, just a part of the game
So much caine in the fast lane, finally a dry eye
When I die, bury me with my fo'-five
And let the devil feel the wrath of a nigga
Goin to Hell with my finger on the trigger
Now everybody's starin
Got a nigga losin hair and they wonder if I'm all there
Well don't blame me, blame the flame that flickers
when niggaz gettin richer (mo' money)
Now tell me if you wanna live forever
Niggaz dyin so be ready for whatever

Rebel Of The Underground 
Rebel.. rebel..    REBEL
Rebel.. rebel..
[2Pac]
They just can't stand the reign, or the occasional pain
from a man like me, who goes against the grain
Sometimes I do it in vain, so with a little bass and treble
Hey Mister!  It's time for me to explain that I'm the rebel
Cold as the devil
Straight from the underground, the rebel, a lower level
They came to see the maniac psychopath
The critics heard of me, and the aftermath
I don't give a damn and it shows
And when I do a stage show I wear street clothes
So they all know me
The lyrical lunatic, the maniac emcee
I give a shout out to your homies
And maybe then, the critics'll leave your boy alone, G
On the streets or on TV
It just don't pay to be, a truth tellin MC
They won't be happy till I'm banned
The most dangerous weapon: an educated black man
So point blank in your face, pump up the bass
and join the human race
I throw peace to the Bay
Cause from the Jungle to Oaktown, they backin me up all the way
You know you gotta love the sound
It's from the rebel -- the rebel of the underground
Rebel he's a rebel, rebel of the underground 
[4X]
[2Pac]
Now I'm face to face with the devils
Cause they breedin more rebels than the whole damn ghetto
And police brutality
shit it put you in the nip and call it technicality
So you reap what you sow
So reap the wrath of the rebel, jackin em up once mo'
Now the fox is in the henhouse, creepin up on your daughter
While you sleep I got her sneakin out
Tupac ain't nuttin nice
I'll be nuttin how I wanna, and doin what I'm gonna
Now I'm up to no good
The mastermind of mischief movin more than most could
So sit and slip into the sound
Peep the rebel -- the rebel of the underground
Rebel he's a rebel, rebel of the underground 
[4X]
[2Pac]
They say they hate me, they wanna hold me down
I guess they scared of the rebel -- the rebel of the underground
But I never let it get me
I just make another record bout the punks tryin to sweat me
In fact, they tryin to keep me out
Try to censor what I say
cause they don't like what I'm talkin bout
So what's wrong with the media today?
Got brothers sellin out cause they greedy to get paid
But me, I'm comin from the soul
And if it don't go gold, my story still gettin told
And that way they can't stop me
And if it sells a couple of copies, the punks'll try to copy
It's sloppy, don't even try to
I'm a slave to the rhythm, and I'm about to fly through
So yo to the people in the ghetto
When ya hear the bass flow, go ahead and let go
Now everybody wanna gangbang
They talkin street slang, but the punks still can't hang
They makin records bout violence 
But when it comes to the real, some brothers go silent
It kinda make you wanna think about
that ya gotta do some sellin out, just to get your record out
But 2Pacalpyse is straight down
So feel the wrath of the rebel -- the rebel of the underground
Tupac is a rebel, rebel of the underground

 Between you and Biggie was like, who's gonna, who's gonna,
who ruled, the, the, nigga kingdom and shit basically, you know what I'm sayin'?
It was like, this is like an election...
[2Pac speaking:]
 It is an election
[Sway Speaking]
 You know what I'm sayin'?
[2Pac speaking]
 Me and Biggie's situation was smaller than that,
me and Biggie's situation was like...
[Reporter Speaking]
 Tupac Shakur was shot several times in the chest... 
[Other reporters talking, then they fade slowly]
[Chorus]
You know, I wonder if they'll laugh when I am dead
Why am I fighting to live, if I'm just living to fight
Why am I trying to see, when there aint nothing in sight
Why am I trying to give, when no one gives me a try
Why am I dying to live, if I'm just living to die
[Notorious B.I.G.]
Check it, I grew up a fuckin screw up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin blew up
Choppin rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryin ta turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missin
Show they toes you know they got stepped on
A fist full of bullets a chest full of Teflon
Run from the police picture that, nigga I'm too fat
I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't phase me
When he drop, take his glock, and I'm Swayze
celebrate my escape, sold the glock, bought some weight
Laid back, I got some money to make, motherfucker
[Chorus]
[2Pac]
And still I'm havin memories of high speeds, when the cops crashed
As I laugh pushin the gas when my glocks blast
We was young, and we was dumb but we had heart
In the dark when we survived through the bad parts
Many dreams is what I had, and many wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
And these bitches they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies now the whole world tryin to screw me
even the cops tried to sue me
So what can I do but stay true, sippin 22's a brewin
now the medias tryin to test me got the press askin questions, tryin to stress me
misery is all I see, thats my mind's state
My history with the police is shakin' the crime rate
Ma main man had 2 strikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped
He screamed 'Thug Life!' and emptied the clip
gots tired of runnin from the police
[chorus]
[Biggie]
I was shocked at everything! Ya know what im sayin. I wasn't more shocked at him dying.
I was more shocked at him. Pac' is a strong dude... I know him... You know what I'm sayin?...
Real strong... so it was when he got shot I was more like "again". You know what I'm sayin?...
He always gettin shot or shot at... He gon' pull threw this one again, make a few of records about it and its gon be over..
You know, then when he died I was like 'Woah'... you know what I'm sayin...
it kinda took me by suprise... even though we was going threw our drama I would NEVER
wish death on nobody! 'cause there ain't no comin back from death

If you a bad boy
[Chorus: repeat 2X]
If you a bad boy then you die
Westside outlawz when we ride, get me high
They fucked up when the rob me
Put another contract on Mobb Deep
[Hussein Fatal]
I focus my locus thought on my enemies
Sip off the Hennessey it's necessary to finish me
I'm in this social immortal when it comes to the phone book
Jersey them niggas they think I'm crazy and creepy
And as we speak they tryin to find me a therapist
Rapid fire I clap and hire till you die a liar
Strap in back to the corners droppin on to spin the tires
My man define ya 357 anaconda
This enough to bring your mama then turn around and hear the drama
Havoc I gotta have it steady blastin at Prodigy
Mobb 6 feet deep you try to blast me till death
And I suppose you got the dopest moves like Chucky on fresh
You know the verdict, who what when why he died murdered
Get your physical diverted and your vision deserted
[Tupac]
Ever since mama got fucked and papa ducked out
Look at us murderous thugs showin less love in the drug house
Similar to savage it's a wonder we manage
Bring chaos causin damage on our quest for cabbage
They ask my style similar to cash we flaunt it
Most wanted by the population murdered you for it
Exploit your weakness revenge flow deep without release
Criminal orders across the waters bringin the war to the streets
Why fear me, fear the shit I speak
Once this shit drop it's heard on every fuckin street
like the sound of police who run the street really
And every hood let you grow 
from the hustlaz up at Harlem to the shot callers in O'
And though, Congress, don't want us to progress our step
My homie buried at an early age hustled to death
His last breath,  a lesson I posses like jewels
Stay thugged out keep it movin'
[Yaki Khadafi]
Halfway thugs are buged when we stalk the streets
Sort of like thugs and narcotics when we walk the streets
You speak the big pussy throw down and drop it
Hit you with 6 shots lay the law down and throw the shells in my pocket
Getting mine with nine coked  extorting
Block shots with 22's with my socks with the butt hangin out the chalk
You never seen time I travel across the mean crime
My rolls like a million dollar bills folded in green slime
With my foes erased drink my henney straight no chasin
Catch my body like haitian 5 minutes from the station
[Young Noble]
Hit the hole like Allen Iverson with confidence
The bigger prick don't mean no evidence or proof the I was present
At the scene of the crime around 10 niggas bleed
After they made this punk fag motherfucker bleed
All the money was bloody as shit, y'all niggas shoulda seen it
Bust a cap and freak with, bow down on your knees shit
The glock to your head nigga, don't let inside action
Hit innocent by-standers when he blasted, shot fucken backwards
Little homies puttin work for stripes
But is it worth your life a g-rides runnin red lights
I wish somebody would have t old me then
Since I'm an outlaw like Napolean ain't no cell they can hold me in
Caucassian crazy like Arabians
Hold this spot like some niggas fade me in having the scene chase me
When they want the product nigga I got the smoke
Got the weed and the coke what you need what you want
What you working with I'm some immortal shit
Outlawz we straight hurtin shit use artillery to murder with
Put then on the box gangsta party like Pac
Lifes hard from the ox me and my niggas on top
[2Pac: repeat 5X]
I know the law hate me dearly, comin for me
We outlaws, thugged out, niggas runnin on E
[Nuttso]
With the leaded Pac, fuck the law
Carry steal cause I live in the nigga side of the law
Ridin' foes cause I can't let hoes catch me slippin
Quick to blow and dispose if you block on hittin
Ridin high, blazing, kryptonite  got a nigga dazing
Burpin and smurkin got on his knees before I grave em
Ride em, look behind him, I see him, he slipped
At a stop light in a growin night, this motherfucken trick
Slide over so I can dip and put it in him
Damn, I guess this motherfucker know that I sent it
Hit the pedal now we high speeding
With the metal trying to make these motherfuckers die freezing
Up the way I seen him slow down
Shit!!  I think I'm gonna bust these hoes down
Caught them runnin on e it kind of funny to me
They know they was fuckin with me but they dumb to see
[2Pac]
Open up fire watchin me spy when my shells split em
Plus all them tricks and the bitches go to hell with em
Fuck em they phony claimin they homies but the foes
Speakin on thug niggas daily while we nailing they hoes
Explode boldly at my stage shows and formation
Words known to spray blaze as I raise my thug nation
Crooked thoughts cops get bought no longer caught
Did you cry when my girl died
Put out the hit politc niggas worldwide grabbin my dick
I'll never learn take away the pain with sherm
Throwin gas on my enemies watchin them burn
Call my posse, I'm shootin up the casket take the body
Whip the corpse like a piata and party
His last breath a straight lesson I posses like jewels
Stay thugged out keep it movin
[Chorus till fade]

but you gotta give a nigga space
or you'll drive me crazy
Run tha Streetz....

and put tha game down tight
for these gamin' bitches could get it right
It might be a plan that i'm choosen

because i'm known for showin' examples 
how i do it
Thinkin' i'm new to this
because i'm younger
where i'll only leave you suspecious and to wonder
and at tha end I make a come up

and all tha fun that it's gonna be
so meet me at 3'
and don't be late nigga

I heard it's popin' at a club
but they say I can't get in
cause i'm dressed like a thug
until I die

stayin' motivated
now that we made it
it's a battle 
just for tha big money
I'm livin' wild

but until then 
give me love
and let me Run tha Streetz
[Chorus x7]
(You can run tha streetz with your Thugs)
i'll be waiting for you

R U Still Down (Remember Me) 
R U Still Down 
[repeat 3X]
[Verse One: 2Pac]
Now up and at em it's on, I was raised to be strong
And Mama told me be a Thug since the day I was born
I came up, out the gutter never changed my style
Got for real about my papers, cause the game was wild
And the fame was a plot to try to change me
And what's strange is nobody knew my name 'fore it came
Now the whole world is calling me a, killer
All I ever did, was try to reach the kids with the real
All the time I was ballin, never heard my friends callin
Couldn't stop myself from fallin, I'm all in
Shit's gettin sleazy, believe me
Best to take what ya need, but don't be greedy
Cause in my mind, I see sunshine, I thought
I didn't have to run, now I'm duckin from the gun yellin, 'One-Time'
Take your time to feel my record, and if you did
chill a second, my blind method, will still wreck it
My young homies stay strong
I wonder if they'll listen to a nigga when he gone, R U Still Down?
[Chorus: 2Pac]
Raise em up... R U Still Down?
[repeat 5X]
[Verse Two: 2Pac]
I'm gettin high, so a nigga think he touch the sky
Turn tough inside, in the rush to die
Livin life as a Thug time to face the truth
What's goin on with the wasted youth, please God
come and save me (save me), had to work with what ya gave me
And got a nigga goin crazy
I can't read the signs, I'm blind, but a nigga know
he need his nine, cause times, they ain't what they used to be
Ain't a penitentiary built big enough for me
and my niggaz on the streets, man listen
Cause these ain't the old days
Ain't no way I'ma bustin my ass and gettin no pay
It seems I can't find my focus, and homey I ain't paranoid
I seen the future and it's hopeless
Lord knows, its hard on a young scrub
It seems I had less problems when I slung drugs
But since I'm tryin lace niggaz with the game
wanna see me locked in chains, tryin to dirty up my name
And them same motherfuckers that was callin me
Will be the first to turn their backs, when I'm fallin, see
I should have seen it from the jump, but now it's clear
This one nigga got the town in fear, but R U Still Down
[Chorus]
[Verse Three: 2Pac]
I wrote this for my critics and my, enemies
Last year ya used to love me, huh REMEMBER ME
Now ya hate me with a passion, tryin to get me stuck in the mix
I'm stayin sharp, got no time for them tricks
And now they wonder if I'm goin to jail
Just as well, cause my life on the streets - a living Hell
And I can't sleep, they got my phone tapped, and mercy Lord
Come get me 'fore they hurt me
Ran outta tears, and through the years couldn't change me
My daddy left me alone, and so I'm angry
I never did nothin wrong, my mama told me, "Baby it's on"
And now I'm hustlin and bustlin bones
Never said it came easy, I'm makin cheese
Buyin all the things on TV, and gettin skeezed
Wish my homeboys could see me now
Little bad motherfucker runnin wild through the town
Please tell me, R U Still Down?
R U Still Down, to raise em up?  Remember me 
[repeat 2X]
R U Still Down, to raise em up?
R U Still Down, to raise em up?  Remember me 
[repeat 3X]
R U Still Down, to raise em up?
R U Still Down, to raise em up?  Remember me 
[repeat 3X]
R U Still Down, to raise em up?
That's right y'all, give them bitches the motherfuckin middle finger
RAISSSSE em up
These hoes can't fade me, don't these bitches know we crazy?
Thug Life, niggaz, be, the sickest
You feel me?  Now get that shit written down
God damn!
Took four years and a motherfuckin case for these motherfuckers to feel me
Ain't that a bitch?
R U Still motherfucking down?
Old hoe ass fake ass niggaz

Same Song 
[Chorus: repeat 2X]
All around the world same song
All all around the world same song
[Shock G]
I came for the party to get naughty get my rocks on
eat popcorn watch you move your body to the pop song
that I'm singing dinga linging funky beats ringing
everybody's swinging in the place
as I kick the J A Z Z Y is my style
R
 mixing it with the hip hop swing beat
Champagne in my hand, it wont be long till I'm gone
It's just the same old song
[Humpty Hump]
It's just a freestyle, meanwhile, we keep the beat kickin
sweat drippin, girlies in the limo eatin chicken
oops don't get the grease on your pantyhose
I love ya Rover, move over, I gotta blow my nose
Sneezin, but still I'm pleasin to all the slimmies
Pull out my jimmie, time to get busy wit a Jenny
if it's good and plenty, dont you know
there I go, there I go, there I go
But I dont go nowhere without my jim hat
If I'm rappin, cause she's clappin
then I'm strappin cause I'm smarter than that
then girlie maybe we can get along
Cutie after cutie, it's just the same old song
[Chorus: repeat 3X]
[Money B]
Money B, the freaky deaky, the sqeaky meaky up and down
as a matter of fact ill be right back i gotta take a leak
So I'm drainin entertainin, but I got fame
and the bases I touch to much for me tryin to be namin
Aiyyo, you saw me on cable and gip
I busted in and I was goin legit
Clark Gable back in Pakland its the same old song
sport these shorties, same freckles and hat
drinkin the same 40's
[Humpty Hump]
hypothetical, political, lyrical, miracle whip
just like butter, my ryhmes are legit
Cause I'm the humpty. not humpty dumpty, but humpty hump
here a hump, there a hump, everywhere a hump
[Shock G]

not dissin dont get me wrong
but to me its just the same old song
so just watch, my name is shock, and i like to rock
and you cant stop this
2Pac go ahead and rock this
[2Pac]
Now I clown around when I hang around with the Underground
Girls use to frown, say I'm down, when I come around
gas me and when they pass me they use to diss me
harrass me, but now they ask me if they can kiss me
Get some fame, people change, wanna live they life high
same song, can't go wrong, if I play the nice guy
(clamin that they must have changed,just because we came strong)
I remain, still the same (why Tu'?) cause it's the same song

Secretz Of War 
[Chorus (E.D.I. Amin):]
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
[E.D.I. Amin]
War Time
War Time, it's either yourz or mine
Outlawz be on a grind, and a mission to shine
And ride on em', leave em' stuck and fucked from the gate
Set it straight, regulate 
wit' a bomb I'm about to detonate (Boom!)
Hesitate, aww, now you know what
ya'll niggaz were here to go
If you know it was good for ya
Buncha toy souljahs all dressed in fatigue
But I'm Edi Amin on a mission to make em bleed
Nigga what?, Nigga who?
It was cool? and at you?, what the fuck is gone do?
Barbecue and boo-hoo
Ride or die, get money all at the same time
Split the pie with the homie, ball at the same time
Any nigga splippin', fall at the same time
We all links in the chain, tryin to gain, do time
We all see the sunshine
But when you could do yourz, we'll bring these muthafuckas war
[Chorus (E.D.I. Amin):]
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
[2Pac]
As I approach the scene, from smokin' green
Got my eyes closed, niggaz so cold on my foes
I make em' die froze
Watch me make em' bleed, make em' G's
Lord help me wit'it
Got me paintin' pictures of a mil-ticket
Help me get'it
See me and pray for options
but the pressures nonstop
Niggaz get the pistol poppin'
And watch they body drop
I'm a lethal threat, watch me hit your set
Flash on, blast on them bitch-made niggaz wit' my mask on
Do it for profit, plus I'm, lookin for punks to bust on
If you ain't screamin' WestSide, you can get the fuck on
I'm seein' demons hittin' weed
Got me hearin' screamin'
Scared to go to sleep, watch the scene like a dope-fiend
Probably be punished for it, though you can't ignore it
I live the life of a thug nigga, and die for it
Niggaz pass the clip and watch me bring em to the floor
I got some shit that they ain't ready for (What you got?)
I got the Secretz of War
[Chorus (E.D.I. Amin):]
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
[Yaki Kadafi]
We do this thug life shit, like 4, 5, 6, dick em'
Down wit' no rounds left up in the pound when the sounds (Here we go)
Squeeze the lead off, I blow his mutha fuckin' head off
Signal all the other outlawz to get this shit set off
Yaki Kadafi, it ain't a cop here to stop me
These streetz is black hockey and raw we get sloppy
Put a pamper on your silly ass prestyle grammar
Locked in the slammer, while I'm layed cocked back like a hammer
Ya'll newly weds that in honey moons, times bout up
Ya'll, that means I leave no trace found with you face, bounce, stuck
Your pig scanners can't come close touch or even hit me
Doin' my dirt, puttin' in work, you see shit, what you gonna do?
[Chorus (E.D.I. Amin):]
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
Yo, we go to war
[Young Noble]
We check the murder rate percentage
Niggaz is finished
Get blood checks from clinics
This thug shit is in us
Flowin' through my system, you a victim
Blunts, I twist em', fuck the whole world
It's us against them
you got some heat?  Pull it out
Cock the hammer if you wit' it, don't make
No difference here, with the 25 to life sentence
We already doin' life on the streetz
Like algae, niggaz be heated, when they walkin' the beat
This shit is flaky, makin' backs shaky, niggaz hate me
Scared to face me, knowin' that the Outlawz blaze me
Pull me up on game, put me up on a hustle
Once I suck my money muscle, all the G's got devils
Movin' shit like a dollar, beatin' niggaz like Rodney
Turn a killa like Kadafi, and a nuke stream to stop me
[Chorus (E.D.I. Amin):]
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
You either ride wit' us, or collide wit' us
It's as simple as that for me and my niggaz
We go to war
[2Pac]
Bring it on
And all you lil' young ass souljahs
You play this shit back about fifteen times
You'll have enough game to roll up in a club or somethin
Teach these bitches a lil' somethin', you know what I mean?
Secretz of muthafuckin' War....

Fake ass nigga, you in shit, for fightin' over bitches
You call that a player?
Straight-ass sissy
See me at my show nigga miss me

So when you think about fuckin' this 
You better wear a vest

Nah we blowin holes in your motherfuckin' skull 
Make sure your ass is smoked

Don't be silly 
You better watch your step
[Syke]
And pussies we crossin when my crew is flossin'
Bitches we tossin' 
And niggas we crossin'
It's like a murder rhyme when we hit your hood
It's all good
The punks? I wish you would!
[Mopreme]
Wouldn't better to just corrolate what we bust
Instead of kickin' dust
Gets a press y'all from nuts
Cause ain't no herbs here
And ain't no morgues
Beware of the water 'cause they full of sharks

But in every state
Niggas perpetrate and test
Where I come from fools die for less
And thugs keep thugin' till their casket drop
It's on 'till I die

[Verse One: 2Pac]
He was a nice middle class nigga
But nobody knew the evil he'd do When he got a little bigger
Get off the final blaze 
While puffing on a Newport
plottin' on a another way to catch a case
Was only sixteen, yet convicted as a felon
With a bunch of old niggas 
But you the only one who ain't telling
I tell you it's a cold world, stay in school
You tell me its a man's world, play the rules
And fade fools, 'n break rules until we major
Blaze up, getting with hoes through my pager
Was raised up, commencing to money makin' tactics
It's getting drastic, niggas got automatics
My fingers on the trigga, Tell the lord
To make way for another straight Thug Nigga
I'm sitting getting buzzed, looking for some luv
from the  homies, cuz shorty wanna be a Thug
[Chorus]
[Verse Two: 2Pac]
Straight from the Hall to the Penn
Adolescent nigga scaling weight and standing Six feet Ten
He carried weight like a Mack truck
Gonna bust on some playa haters 
if the mutha fuckas act tuff
Then thats when the lethal weapon with the razor
This little nigga smoking weed and getting blazed up
No one could figure, when the guns blast pull the trigga
Could take the life of a young nigga guns bigger
No mother and father, you see, the niggas all alone
Old timers my role model, the war zone
Released with this game 'til its a part of me
My heart don't beat no fear and it ain't hard to see
The future is looking dim
I'm trying to make a profit out of living in this sin
I'm in the dark getting buzzed, looking for some love
out with the homies, cuz shorty wanna be a Thug
[Chorus]
[Outro: 2Pac]
Shorty gonna be a thug
You little bad ass nigga, to the young niggas
gotta stay sharp nigga, play your part
you got plenty of time (you bad mutha fuckas)
You only get three mistakes, then thats life, big baby (niggas craaazy)
watch the signs
Damn, you ain't but sixteen nigga?

Oh I know you can!

Hey Daz, nigga stop fuckin around with the piano nigga
Just drop that shit like uhh, this here

I met you through my homie now you act like you don't know me
So disappointed cause baby that shit was so phony
It's not for me, you see no lovin from my closest homies
Woulda paid you no mind, but baby you was all up on me
While you proceed with precision, you had the table hosed
No, I ain't mad at you baby, go 'head and play them fools
They chose not to listen, so now he stuck inside his house 
and can't leave without his bitch permission
The mission's to be a playa, my alias is Boss
Drop a top on these jealous niggaz, playa let me floss
Y'all don't wanna see me in pain
I'll leave that ass like Toni Braxton, "Never breathing again"
It's scandalous, I never liked your back stabbin ass, triiick
Used to watch you money grabbin, who you baggin beeyitch?
Ready to bust, in the city you don't know who to trust
But bitches lookin scandalous
[Chorus: Nate Dogg]
Scandalous.. she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous.. she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
Scandalous.. she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous.. she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
[2Pac]
How's it hangin?  Cause baby from the back the shit is bangin
I've been stressin in this ghetto game, tryin to do my thang
Won't be no bullshit, no ass-kissin
This bitch'll have ya wakin up with all your cash missin
I'm askin, as if I'm qualified to analyze
You're lookin at a bitch who specialize in tellin lies
She got a body make a motherfucker fantasize
Her face ain't never shed a tear through them scandalous eyes
My sister ? in poverty
Plus I knew she was a freak bitch so why should it bother me?
I'd probably be sprung, addicted to the heat of her tongue
and though I don't where we're goin, she's makin me come
I've been trained as a boss playa, so what you sayin?
Let me show you, got some hookers we can toss later
Before I let her get me off guard
Went in the purse took a hundred dollars
Nigga I'm so scandalous
[Chorus]
[2Pac]
Dangerous and ambitious, while schemin on gettin riches
I'm spittin at tricks cause I'm addicted to pretty bitches
Currency motivated, not easily terminated
Now that we made it, my niggaz can never be faded
This is my prophecy -- I gotta be paid
All you cowards that try to stop me is beggin for early graves
I thought we was cool, I was a fool, thinkin you could be true
when I don't fuck with your punk crew
These are the tales for my niggaz doin time in the cell
I went from hell, to livin well
Bustin at niggaz who said my name in vain
I got no time for them tricks, I'm heavy in the game
I wanna be a baller, please
But the bitches and the liquor keep on callin me
I'm floatin free on the highway, formulatin plans
Can't wait til I see L.A., cause it's so scandalous
[Chorus]
[Chorus repeat to end (2Pac speaks over it)]
[2Pac]
Aiyyo.. how the prettiest bitch be the more scandalous the hoe be
You ever peep that shit?  (Nah)
A bitch can be like fifteen, fuckin with a nigga 35
Gettin him for ends
Hoes these days is way too motherfuckin intelligent
When these niggaz get to trickin, hahaha, it's over then
That's aight though
Keep a nigga heavy in the game, bout so long
Watch them hoes
All you niggaz out there
Beware these lyin ass scandalous bitches

Niggaz die wit' open eyes 
Scare to take a nap 
It's a trap a long maze 
Dreamin' of gettin' stacks 
Makin' scratch the wrong way 
What the song say 
We murder motherfuckers daily 
Black out blow the crack out 
My lyrics neva fail me 
I inhale strong weed then release the stress 
Deliver the bomb shit from the east to west 
Like yay-yo 
Niggaz pull out when I say so 
Commence to poppin' motherfuckers copy it fatal 
'fficiently I delete then flee 
The art of war 
Livin' sucka free 
Get wit' me 
Motherfucker don't sleep 
[Chorus x2: 2Pac]
Don't go to sleep 
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep 
Other niggaz close they eyes 
Seein' dreams in they sleep 
But don't fall asleep 
[Young Buck:]
I'm starin' thru my rear view 
Doin' 'bout 90 
The petal to the metal 
So I can see what's behind me 
Buckle up your seat belt eyes on the road 
They know we ridin' dirty gotta play it how it go 
They close down the projects the clubs been closed 
And then they wonder why niggaz breakin down o's 
I'm a run away slave 
Ya get it nigga off the chain 
I got that thug life shit runnin' thru my viens 
And now they scare 
They know that I been heaven sent 
And yeah we know the dope comin' from the president 
But look at us 
We ain't got shit to lose 
Feel like we ballin' if we got a new pair of tennis shoes 
In the ghetto or better yet home sweet home 
This is the land of the free 
But to me that's wrong 
I'm on my way to the white house strapped wit' my heat 
So don't fall asleep 
Come on niggaz 
[Chorus x2]
[Chamillionaire:]
They say that the moe they hate ya the moe that it motivate ya 
My mind set on grind my mental set on the paper 
62 hours and countin' and I'm still awake 
And they slippin' me sleepin' pills wit' the will I break 
Broke nigga always tellin' ya how to make ya cash adjust 
So I just stop listenin' and now my cash is up 
Red dotted the media cause they always mad at us 
I don't see 'em tryin' to mediate when we get gats and bust 
They just instigate and as soon as the get the tape 
It's dropped from my nigga life just as soon as they get the case 
Personally I ain't trippin' on all this rappin' stuff 
I'm takin' back my money counter cause it wasn't fast enough, yep 
I got a couple problems (word) and none of 'em is money 
Just those that love me to pretend to love me and say they buddies 
Sometimes I want to maneuver with the ruger 
To live like Freddie Krueger these nightmares just ain't as buddy 
In meetings they always askin' what my passion is 
(And the) money talks so I always have words to answer this (yep) 
I can't relax cause its like I'm a fetti activist 
Might see me on tv never a mat-tress 
[Chorus]
Don't go to sleep 
[Chorus]
Sleep banger 
[Chorus x2]

So Many Tears 
I shall not fear no man but God
Though I walk through the valley of death
I shed so many tears (if I should die before I wake)
Please God walk with me (grab a nigga and take me to Heaven)
Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone I grew up amongst a dyin breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me can you feel me? I'm not livin in the past, you wanna last
Be tha first to blast, remember Kato
No longer with us he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets
Now rest in peace
Is there heaven for a G?  Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears
Ahh, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears..
Lord, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears
Now that I'm strugglin in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world cause I'm cursed, I'm havin visions
of leavin here in a hearse, God can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure, and all the pain
Show me some happiness again, I'm goin blind
I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin well
I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail?
My life is in denial, and when I die, 
baptized in eternal fire I'll shed so many tears
Lord, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears..
Lord, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears
Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears
I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step, to bring me closer
to embrace an early death, now there's nothin left
There was no mercy on the streets, I couldn't rest
I'm barely standin, bout to go to pieces, screamin peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin the flame
inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Paintin a picture of my enemies killin me, in my sleep
Will I survive til the mo'nin, to see the sun
Please Lord forgive me for my sins, cause here I come...
Lord, I suffered through the years (God) and shed so many tears..
God, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears
Lord knows I.. tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drivebys takin lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future right for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin crazy
Disillusioned lately, I've been really wantin babies
so I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady, cause she's a product of this poison
I'm hearin noises, think she fuckin all my boys, can't take no more
I'm fallin to the floor; beggin for the Lord to let me in
to Heaven's door -- shed so many tears
(Dear God, please let me in)
Lord, I've lost so many years, and shed so many tears..
I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears
Lord, I suffered through the years, and shed so many tears..
God, I lost so many peers, and shed so many tears

Soon As I Get Home 
(feat. Yaki Kadafi)
[Tupac talking]
Soon as I get home...
Soon as I get home
[Verse One (Tupac):]
Dear baby it's me again
Stuck inside this Max' Pen'
Trying to pay my debt for all my sins
See
These penitentiary time's be so heavy on my mind
At times it's like I'm living just to die
I'm living in hell
Stuck in my jail cell
Stranded in the county jail
Waiting for my chance to post bail
I wanna be paid in large stacks
And mash in fast Jag's
I blast and wonder how long will I last
My memories fade when I'm intoxicated
Busters be shady
So I'm dumping on cowards crazy whenever faded
I know I said it all before but now I mean it
Visions of you and me balling so crystal clear I seen it
Even though you mad at me you'll be glad to see the strategy
Of making these chips come so easily
I max out in the morning baby life is good
Me and you against the whole hood
Soon as I come home
[Chorus (Tupac):]
Grab my strap
Locate my comrades
Let's get my enemies not knowing I'm coming back
(As soon as I get home)
Go get the money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets to a war zone
Soon as I get home
[Verse Two (Tupac):]
Sitting here looking at pictures of me and you living
But now you out in the world
While I'm twisted in prison
Love letters come daily, words of affection
You send me money and news clips, begging for some sex
Stay wide open keep yours eyes peeled
And my advice is keep it real or you can die squealing
Plus I never have to worry about a visit cause your there daily
Guards trying to get your number you don't dare tell me
Tongue kissing steady humping
Trying to touch or something
Before the co. in the corner jump in
Frontin'
Late night reminiscing
Everybody's quiet, I think something's in the air
Prepare for the riot
It's padlocks in my socks, steel from the bed springs
I touch 'em with thug love, but then let they head's ring
Started a war but now I'm gone
Release me to the streets in the morning it's on
Soon as I get home
[Chorus (Tupac):]
Grab my Gats
Locate my comrades
Let's get my enemies not knowing I'm coming back
(Soon as I get home)
Let's get the money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets to a war zone
Soon as I get home
[Verse Three (Kadafi):]
Since you've been gone my whole life's been like a game of Cee-Lo
Thinking big like that kid Casino fulfilling my dreams like Nino
Brown, the whole town be shook up
And me and momma surviving depends on how many rocks a young nigga cooked up
Narcotics got drastic, seen them niggas you blasted
Wanting me in a casket, on the grind coping plastic's
Yea nigga I heard, Lil Moo gave the word
You get paroled on the third, it's all love
Still these herb's, be out here fronting
Still here but all about nothing
My double's o's what I'm wanting and I'm trying to see something we ain't never had
Luxury life's results living bad tricks of the trade shit that should of been taught by dad
But learnt through the crew, lesson's between me and you
And once we lock this shit down, there ain't a thing they can do
Meanwhile I'll stay waiting by the phone
Hoping I'll get the call telling a nigga that you home
Wuuut?
Grab the Gats
Locate my comrades
Let's get my enemies not knowing I'm coming back
Go get the money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets to a war zone
Soon as I get home
Grab my Gats
Locate my comrades
Go get my enemies not knowing I'm coming back
Go get my money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets to a war zone
Soon as I get home
Grab my Gats
Locate my comrades
Let's get my enemies not knowing I'm coming back
Go get my money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets to a war zone
Soon as I get home
Grab my Gats
Locate my comrades
Let's get my enemies not knowing I'm coming back
Go get my money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets to a war zone
Soon as I get home
Grab my Gats
Locate my comrades
Go get my enemies not knowing I'm coming back
Go get my money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets to a war zone
Soon as I get home
Grab my Gats
Locate my comrades
Go get my enemies not knowing I'm coming back
Go get my money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets to a war zone
Soon as I get home
Grab my Gats
Locate my comrades
Go get my enemies not knowing I'm coming back
Go get my money out the safe
It's time to turn the streets to a war zone
A war zone

Crack done took a part of my family tree
My mom is on the shit, my daddy's splittin, mom is steady blamin me
Is it my fault, just cause I'm a young black male?
Cops sweat me as if my destiny is makin crack sales
Only fifteen and got problems
Cops on my tail, so I bail til I dodge 'em
They finally pull me over and I laugh
"Remember Rodney King?" and I blast on his punk ass
Now I got a murder case..
.. you speak of heaven punk?  I never heard of the place
Wanted to come up fast, got a Uz and a black mask
Duckin fuckin 'Task', now who's the jack-ass?
Keep my shit cocked, cause the cops got a glock too
What the fuck would you do - drop them or let 'em drop you?
I chose droppin the cop
I got me a glock, and a glock for the niggaz on my block
Momma tried to stab me, I moved out
Sold a pound a weed, made G's, bought a new house
I'm only seventeen, I'm the new kid
Got me a crew, bought 'em jewels, and a Uz'-thick
But all good things don't last
'Task' came fast, and busted my black ass
Coolin in the pen, where the good's kept
Now my little brother wants to follow in my footsteps
A soulja
[Chorus]
[2Pac]
Buck, buck - niggaz get fucked, don't step to this
Quiet as kept I'm blessed on a quest with a death wish
Tell 'em to come and test, and arrest, nigga it's hectic
Here's the anorexic, I'm makin it to an exit
Walkin through the streets on the black tip
Packed with several gats, cause I'm on some "pay 'em back" shit
Niggaz don't wanna try me, brother you'll get shot down
Now I'm king of the block, since my bigger brother's locked down
I'm hot now, so many punk police have got shot down
Other coppers see me on the block, and they jock now
That's what I call a kingpin
Send my brother what he needs and some weed up to Sing-Sing
Tellin him just be ready set
Pack ya shit up quick; and when I hit, be prepared to jet
Niggaz from the block on the boat now
Every single one got a gun, that'll smoke - pow!
These punks about to get hit by the best
I'm wearin double vest.. so aim at my fuckin chest
I'll be makin straight dome calls
Touch the button on the wall, you'll be pickin up your own balls
I can still hear my mother shout..
"Hit the pig nigga, break your bigger brother out"
I got a message for the warden
I'm comin for ya ass, as fast as Flash Gorden
We get surrounded in the mess hall, yes y'all
A crazy motherfucker makin death calls
Just bring me my brother and we leavin
For every minute you stall, one of y'all bleedin..
They brought my brother in a jiffy
I took a cop, just in case things got tricky
And just as we was walkin out (BANG!)
I caught a bullet in the head, the screams never left my mouth
My brother caught a bullet too
I think he gon' pull through, he deserve to
The fast life ain't everything they told ya
Never get much older, following the tracks of a soulja
[Chorus]
[Chorus: softly in background 0.5X]

Starin' Through My Rear View 
[Tupac]
Staring at the world through my rearview
Just looking back at the world, from another level yaknowhatImean?
Starin...
Multiple gunshots fill the block, the fun stops
Niggaz is callin cops, people shot, nobody stop
I wonder when the world stopped caring last night
Two kids shot while the whole block staring
I will never understand this society, first they try
to murder me, then they lie to me, product of a dying breed
All my homies trying weed, now the little baby's
crazed raised off Hennesey, tell me will my enemies
flee when they see me, believe me
Even Thugs gotta learn to take it easy, listen
Through the intermissions search your heart for a plan
and we turnin Bad Boys to grown men, it's on again
I give a holla to my niggaz in the darkest corners
Roll a perfect blunt, and let me spark it for ya
One love from a thug nigga rollin with a posse
full of paranoid drug dealers, to the end my friend
I'm seein nuttin but my dreams comin true
While I'm starin at the world through my rearview (see) 
[repeat 2X]
(They got me) starin at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause it's time to die (we)
Gettin high, watchin time fly, and all my motherfuckers 
[repeat 2X]
[E.D.I.]
Now you see him, now you don't, some niggaz
be here for the moment, and then they gone, what happened to em?
Well let's see, it seems to be a mystery
But all I know I never let the money get to me
Stay down like the, truest
Thug Life until I check out this bitch, I thought you knew this
Who is, gonna catch me when I fall or even care to
While you thinkin I see you lost up in my rearview
Half you, is down with them Outlawz
Outcast, left far, I'm through like southpaws
But still we keep mashin til our dreams come through
Starin at the world through my rearview
[Tupac]
Now I was raised as a young black male
In order to get paid, forced to make crack sales
Caught a nigga so they send me to these overpacked jails
In the cell, countin days in this livin black Hell, do you feel me?
Keys to ignition, use at your discretion
Roll with a twelve gauge pump for protection
Niggaz hate me in the section from years of chin checkin
Turn to Smith and Wesson war weapons
Heavenly Father I'm a soldier, I'm gettin hotter
cause the world's gettin colder, baby let me hold ya
Talk to my guns like they fly bitches
All you bustas best to run look at my bitches
Now I know the answers to the question, do dreams come true
Still starin at the world through my rearview (I say)   
[repeat 2X]
(They got me) starin at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause it's time to die
Gettin high, watchin time fly -
and all my motherfuckers/nigga can die  
[repeat 2X]
[Khadafi]
Back in the days we hustled for sneakers and beepers
Nine-six for glocks cause fiends hittin up blocks with street sweepers
Bless myself when knowin rules to these streets, somethin I learned
in school, on some Million Man March shit for the piece/peace
True that, only one life to lead, a fast life of greed
Criminally addicted, infested since a seed
We all die, breed bleed like humans, towns run
by young guns, Outlawz and truants, shit's deep
Turn eighteen, burn my will when I go
Burnt my body with my shotty, or chosin my dough
So while you reminiscin all nights out with the crew
Smoke a blunt for me too, I'm starin through your rearview
[Tupac]
Hahahaha, you ain't knowin what we mean by starin through the rearview
So since you ain't knowin what we mean let me break down understandin
The world, the world is behind us
Once a motherfucker get an understanding on the game
and what the levels and the rules of the game is
Then the world ain't no trick no more
The world is a game to be played
So now we lookin at the world, from like, behind us
Niggaz know what we gotta do, just gotta put our mind to it and do it
It's all about the papers, money rule the world
Bitches make the world go round
Real niggaz do they wanna do, bitch niggaz do what they can't
Starin at the world through my rearview
Go on baby scream to God, he can't hear you
I can feel your heart beatin fast cause it's time to die
Gettin high, watchin time fly, ya know/and we'll be

But I ain't fallin' yet
And I gotta give a shout to where my ball is at

Try to make a mill off the time I'm givin'

Can't nobody fade me
And I been goin' insane lately
And everybody tryin ta hold me back
I'm about to snap

Thug Life,   y'all know the rules
gotta do whatcha gotta do (Stay True)
Maaaannnn, I don't worry about the Five-O
if they start,
cuz it's all about survival
Just stay smart
Keep your mind on your bank roll
always 
stay ahead of these stank hos   
These days
It's an all out rat race
And look at MEEE just caught another cat case
That makes three
My laywers getting cash up the ass
Don't even ask
Why I'm buck wild ? 
Don't smile 
don't laugh
To the young G's comin up 
peep game
Don't let the money make you change 
or act strange
Stay broke
It's all in together now
Keep pumping loud 
till the crowd 
bring the top down
Is that Tupac Thug Life ?
Hell Yah
Try to dirty up my name 
but it's still here
which way do I turn ? 
i'm strapped
Lost in the storm
I can't turn back
with that...

Still Ballin 
(feat. Trick Daddy)
Straight motherfuckin ballin
Part two, still ballin
Westside
[Verse One: 2Pac]
Now ever since a nigga was a seed
Only thing promised to me was the penitentiary, still ballin
Ridin on these niggaz cause they lame
In a six-one Chevy, still heavy in this game, can you feel me?
Blame it on my momma I'm a thug nigga
Up befo' the sun rise, quicker than the drug dealers
Tell me if it's on, nigga then we first to bomb
Bust on these bitch-made niggaz hit 'em up, WESTSIDE
Ain't nobody love me as a broke nigga
Finger on the trigger Lord forgive me if I smoke niggaz
I love my females strapped, no fuckin from the back
I get my currency in stacks, California's where I'm at - right?
Passed by while these niggaz wonder why
I got shot but didn't die, let 'em see who's next to try
Did I cry, hell nah, nigga tear I shed
for all my homies in the pen, many peers dead
Niggaz still ballin
[Chorus: dominated by Trick Daddy]
Still ballin, until I die
You can bring your crew motherfucker
I be ballin, they wonder why
(You can bring your crew but we remain true motherfuckers still)
[Verse Two: Trick Daddy]
Now as I kneel and pray I hope the Lord understand
When he's gone, devolve, I become a dangerous man
Ain't crazy or deranged, I'm sayin (I'm sayin)
But when these kids go to spray 'em boy I don't be playin
With clientele, any rhyme sales
Question is, will you fuck-niggaz ride for real, huh?
Bitch nigga this is G rated
Plus your homeboy won't make it, street game Fugazi
I'm elevated to the top of this shit
Done fucked around and put me and 2Pac on the bitch
And you can tell 'em THUG LIFE was the reason for this
And I ride for any nigga who believe in the shit
I'm still ballin
[Chorus: 2Pac]
Still ballin, 'til the day I die
You can bring your crew but we remain true motherfuckers
Still ballin, niggaz wonder why
You can bring your crew but we remain true motherfuckers
Still ballin
[Verse Three: 2Pac]
Now everybody wanna see us dead
Two murdered on the front page, shot to death, bullets to the head
Niggaz holla out my name and it's similar to rape
Motherfuckers know I'm comin, so they runnin to they graves, watch
Swoop down with my nigga from the Pound
Cause {Trick} don't give a fuck, where you coward niggaz now, blast
Keep pumpin, ain't worried bout nuttin
Busters thought we was frontin, so reload and keep dumpin
[Chorus - Trick Daddy version]
[Chorus - 2Pac version]

Still I Rise 
Dear Lord
As we down here, struggle for as long as we know
In search of a paradise to touch (my ni**a Johnny J)
Dreams are dreams, and reality seems to be the only place to go
The only place for us
I know, try to make the best of bad situations
Seems to be my life's story
Ain't no glory in pain, a soldier's story in vain
And can't nobody live this life for me
It's a ride y'all, a long hard ride
[2Pac]
Somebody break me I'm dreamin, I started as a seed the semen
Swimmin upstream, planted in the womb while screamin
on the top, was my pops, my momma screamin stop
From a single drop, this is what they got
Not to disrespect my peoples but my poppa was a loser
Only plan he had for momma was to f**k her and abuse her
Even as a little seed, I could see his plan for me
Stranded on welfare, another broken family
Now what was I to be, a product of this heated pa*sion
Momma got pregnant, and poppa got a piece of a*s
Look how it began, nobody gave a f**k about me
Pistol in my hand, this cruel world can do without me
How can I survive? Got me askin white Jesus
will a ni**a live or die, cause the Lord can't see us
in the deep dark clouds of the projects, ain't no sunshine
No sunny days and we only play sometimes
When everybody's sleepin
I open my window jump to the streets and get to creepin
I can live or die, hope I get some money 'fore I'm gone
I'm only 19, I'm tryin to hustle on my own
on the spot where everybody and they pops tryin to slang rocks
I'd rather go to college, but this is where the game stops
Don't get it wrong cause it's always on, from dusk to dawn
You can buy rocks glocks or a herringbone
You can ask my man Ishmael Reed
Keep my nine heated all the time this is how we grind
Meet up at the cemetary then get smoked out, pa*s the weed ni**a
That Hennessey'll keep me keyed ni**a
Everywhere I go ni**az holla at me, "Keep it real G"
And my reply til they kill me
Act up if you feel me, I was born not to make it but I did
The tribulations of a ghetto kid, still I rise
[Ta'He]
Still I (still I) I rise (I rise)
Please give me to the sky (the sky)
And if (and if) I die (I die)
I don't want you to cry
[Hussein Fatal]
I stay sharp as always
Runnin ya bricks with blitz, through ya project hallways
Dumpin crews like two's, ni**a all day
Secrets of war prepare me for the worst
A life that's lavish full of cabbage or a life that's in a hearse
But now my dreams it seeems though, be placin triple beams and things bro
Diamond pinkie ring got the loot poppin out my jeans
[Outlawz]
Now I plan to keep my glock cocked
If trouble was searchin for me then why not?
Show em what I'm made of plus raised on, on my block
Chancellor Ave, where many turn to the street, thugs snatchin bags
We out for power, makin cash it wasn't fast it'll make me mad
I'm just like, pimpin
My homey on the corner with his gat tucked, in
Youngest they buckin somethin the life he leads
the life he don't need, don't we all know
He tryin to rise up and we just go doe, still he rise
[Outlawz]
Dreams of lost hope
I hit the strip broke where the fiends get coke
and still I rise now I float cowards ghost
Whenever we come around, I'm runnin down
clutchin a pound, live as sirens, duckin the sound
I used to hustle with my moms til the sun came
My homey Harm doin time from this drug game
Stolen cars, war scars, born a Outlaw
Behind bars, go to sleep just to see the stars
Freedom is ours, though we trapped on a firm block
Crackheads only ten learn to duck cops
[Khadafi]
In ninety-six my glock's my plastic, pa*sion for blastin bastards
No faces for open caskets, peelin ya cap backwards
Ya cowards ain't prepared for pistol practice
I send my missiles through your mattress
Leavin holes in your body like a cactus
While me and my crew be boppin more greens than topic
and loot to keep the seams in my motherf**kin jeans poppin
Leavin ya spleen to pick up
Half of you ni**az is softer than a Snicker
Let's go to war and see who draw quicker
and still I rise, and still I rise...
[Ta'He]
Still I (still I) I rise (I rise)
Please give me to the sky (the sky)
And if (and if) I die (I die)
I don't want you to cry
Still I (still I) I rise (I rise)
Please give me to the sky (the sky)
And if (and if) I die (I die)
I don't want you to cry

Y'all ni**az fake
All day everyday
So now I got roller blades, bi**h
Thought you knew 
Your mouth is rich
C'mon pops, let's go..

Str8 Ballin 
I would share the definition of ballin' with you white folks...
but no.
[Tupac]
I'm up before the sunrise, first to hit the block.
Little bad mothafucka with a pocket full of rocks.
And I'm totin' these thangs, get my skinny little ass kicked.
And niggas laugh, til' tha first mothafucka got blasted.
I put the nigga in his casket,
Now they coverin' the bastard in plastic.
I smoke blunts on a regular buck when it counts. 
I'm tryin' to make a million dollars outta quarter ounce.
And gettin' lost on the five-o, fuck them hos.
Got a 45 screamin' about survival.
Hey nigga can I lay low, cook some yay-yo.
Hollar "one-time" when I say so.
Don't want to go to the pen, I'm hittin' fences.
Narcs on a nigga's back, missin' me by inches.
And they say how do you survive weighin' 165
In a city where the skinny niggas die?
Tell Mama don't cry.
Even when they kill me,
They can never take the game from a young G.
I'm st8 ballin'!
St8 ballin'!
Still on parole and I'm the first nigga servin'
pour some liquor on the curb for my niggas that deserve it.
But if I want to make a million, gotta stay dealin'.
It's kinda boomin' and today I'll make a killin'.
Dressin' down like a villian', but only on the block.
It's a clever disguise to keep me runnin' from the cops.
Ha, I'm gettin' high. I think I'll die if I don't get no ends.
I'm in a bucket with 'em ridin' it like it's a Benz.
I hate to stip let my music bump,
Drinkin' liquor, and I'm lookin' for some hoes to fuck.
Rather die makin' money than live poor and legal
As I slang another ounce, I wish it was a kilo.
A need money in a major way.
Time to fuck my BEEEYATCH!! Hey!, and getten' paid
You other mothafuckas callin',
But me and my mothafuckin' thug niggas,
We st8 ballin'!!
St8 ballin'!
Damned if I don't, and damned if a nigga do.
So watch a young mothafucka pull a trigga just to RAISE UP!
But don't let them see you cry, dry your eyes
Young nigga time to do or die.
I keep a pistol in my pocket,
Ready on my block.
Ain't no time for a nigga to even cock shit.
And now they see that mothafucka beat pain,
At point blank range cause he slept on the game.
Ain't a damned thing changed
Shakin' the dice, now roll 'em,
If you can't stand pain better hold 'em.
Cause ain't no tellin' what you might roll.
You might go catch AIDS from a slight cold.  Nigga.
Better live your life to the fullest,
You 'bout to kill a fool, got a pistol mothafucka better pull it.
Cause even when they kill me, 
they can never take the game from a young G.
We st8 ballin'!
We st8 ballin'!
To my niggas in the penitentiary,
Loked up like a mothafucka when they mention me.
Cause you fuckin' with the realest motha fucka ever born,
And once again it's on, 
I'm bustin' on these bitches till they gone.
Who the hell can you get to stop me?
I'm in the projects, parlaying with my posse.
I keep my glock cocked
I need it cause they're all shady.
I finally made it 
now these jealous bitches tryin' to FADE me!
I ain't goin' out I'd rather blast back.
I'm on the corner with my niggas watchin' cash stack.
And I came up a long way from food stamps.
And takin' shit from the low-life ghetto tramps.
Could you blame me if they sweat me I'm gonna open fire.
What could I do?  Pull my trigga or watch my nigga die.
I'm representin' to the fullest givin' devil slugs.
I'm on the block slangin' drugs with the young thugs.
And mothafucka, we be ballin'!
All mothafuckin' day long, stay strong!
We st8 ballin'.

Look how paranoid these niggas got me 
Cellular calls are being traced 
Since surveillance silently 
Momma chill 
Thug livin pay the bills 
And die violently 
Closed caskets 
Expose bastards I leave em bloody 
Deloris Tucker don't let your kids hear a nigga speak on gettin money 
Ain't nothin funny

Lethal weapon I'ma savage 
Still a method to my madness 
BLAST niggaz laugh call em care cabbage 
Read em and weep, put em to sleep they hell bound 
Lyrics will leave em spell bound 
Clown now tired of being held down 
Cross my heart hope to die 
Blinded in some pussy 
Millionaire 
Living care free 
Sucka free 
Playa haters miss me 
Hope in hard times never catch me slippin 
Fuck authorities they wonder why minorities be trippin 
We ain't having it 
Time to tear this shit back, ghetto children kick back 
Once I hit the mat 
Niggaz will never get this shit back 
Spit it so eloquently 
My pistols represent me 
Bust until my rounds empty 
Back for the street fame 
[Chorus]
(One love to my true thugs) 
Comin to a ghetto near you 
Street fame 
(bust) 
Comin to a ghetto near you 
Street fame 
All out warfare, eye for a eye 
Bustin on my enemies bad boy killing 
(Street fame) 
Straight dissing you 
Fuck Lil' Kim you Nasty Bitch 
[Verse Two]
Temperatures rises 
Niggaz blinded by my lyrical disguise 
No time to plot retreats 
Niggaz shiver and die 
Multiple rounds found laced 
In his body and face 
Wrapped in plastic the acid, erased all traces 
Criminal tactics the rap game 
Became so drastic 
Military mind mashed all the walls they blasted 
If we bleed then they suffocate 
Chokin in terror 
So we strive singularize we reflect in the mirrors 
The prophecy is clear 
Niggaz lock n load disappear 
Strategize with no fear 
Waging war for years 
The crack game wasn't big enough 
Ready to rush 
You bitch made motherfuckers get murdered and touched 
I go to jail niggaz screamin 
FREE ME 
Speakin freely 
Conversatin with my comrades 
Kicking Swahili 
Indeed nature feel my first seed 
It gets worse 
Plans are cursed to be a G 
On the first to breathe 
Currency in stacks 
Artillery in the back 
Strapped 
Armies, we camouflaged in all black 
When we attack 
Holla out my set 
Nigga tighten your jaw 
Givin birth to outlawz 
(Ha ha) 
Street fame 
[Chorus]
(Bust nigga bust) 
Comin to a ghetto near you 
(hell yeah) 
Street fame it's true 
(Only Makaveli the Don can put it down like this, Hey Nas ...) (Note: "time to die" was removed) 
Comin to a ghetto near you 
With street fame 
[Verse Three]
Positive identification 
Got me rushed to the station 
Stuck in this line up 
Tryin hard to hide my face 
They placed the name but can't recall description 
I ain't did shit officer 
That bitch trippin 
Promise retaliation 
They plan busted 
No man to be trusted 
Everything corrupted once man touched it 
Kamikaze 
Hoping that none of the spies find me 
That's why we bye bye daily 
Knowin cops trail me 
But why cry 
Floatin while we tokin on this potent branch 
Flossing in the thug stance, flipping pockets out inside my pants 
Never underestimate me 
Playa hate me 
See me and hide 
Sure as hollow points shatter, enemies die 
Spread love dead thugs 
Gettin buried in riches 
Take a chance to advance fuck them worrin bitches 
Penitentiary's a possibility, bust and pray 
Wear a rubber so I live to fuck another day 
HEY... 
Ain't nothin strange 
I'm 25 dying to change 
But still I bang wanting street fame 
(That's the end of that) 
Thugged out, Makaveli the Don 
Representin the Outlawz

If the lifestyle that you living 
Got you taking more fucking shorts 
Than getting props 
Then that lifestyle need to stop 
Best to recognize some Outlaw shit

To see what this life's supposed to be like 
Nigga you'll start to see riches, fine bitches and hitting switches 
Shit 
To me that shit sound delicious

['Pac speaking]
Yo 'Law!
Is it cool if a nigga just get fucked up for this one?
Yeah!  Mr. Fuck-a-Cop is BACK..
and I still don't give a fuck, yaknahmsayin?
Puffin on this indo.. in the studio with my partners out here
Pacific Heights in the house, know what I mean
[2Pac]
I was framed, so don't make the same mistake, nigga
You gotta learn how to shake the snakes, nigga
Cause the police love to break a nigga
Send em upstate cause they straight-up hate the niggaz
So what I do is get a crew of zoo niggaz
Straight fools into rules and do niggaz
And one-time had enough of me
I'm still raw so the law can't fuck with me
They wanna send me to the pen, punk picture that
I stay strapped motherfuckers better get your gat
It ain't easy bein me I can't take it
Life as a celebrity ain't everything they make it
And ever since the movies, these hoes try to do me
If they can't screw me, they find a way to sue me
Now can you picture me coolin, at a night club?
Nothin but love, but motherfuckers wanna mean mug
Since I wear a lot of gold, they plot
Don't know what I got, and get shot with the hot ones
And aww yeah, I wanna feel guilty
but you punk motherfuckers tried to milk me
You'll get smacked behind the hill with my phone on my pager
It's beepin while I cut you with my razor
I'm not violent, I'm petrified and nervous
I got no mercy for these niggaz tryin to serve us
But if you catch me outta pocket, then I'm got
You love to shoot a nigga but you scared to pop a cop
Now drop it
[Chorus: 2Pac]
Strictly for my - strictly for my - strictly for my niggaz
Strictly for my - strictly for my - strictly for my niggaz
Strictly for my - strictly for my - strictly for my niggaz
Strictly for my niggaz makin G's
[2Pac]
Reflected and disrespected, plus I'm rejected
You're just another rapper, who swears he's makin records
That's what they said - whenever I would walk by
I never tripped though - always kept my head up high
Eventually, I knew that I would find my way
After the darkest night, always comes a brighter day
And some would say, that turned away is all you'll get
I just said, "bet," and never let 'em see me sweat
Cause in the end, I knew that I would have it all
while non-believers, were prayin for my downfall
And some would call, and tell me that they wish me well
but in my heart, I'm knowin that they wish me hell
Yo get a real job, rappin doesn't pay the rent
I hate the studio cause that's where all my money went
Never surrender, it's all about the faith you've got
Don't ever stop, just push it til you hit the top
And if you drop, at least you know you gave your all
Be true to you, and that way you can never fall
But beware, these backstabbers ain't no joke
Just like a rope, they hang on you until you're broke
And when you're broke, they move onto the next dope
And there you are, can't even pay your car, nope
And when you reminisce, thinkin how you got dissed
remember how it felt, and then remember this
Be true to you, believe that there's no one bigger
Cause they can all suck dick - it's strictly for my niggaz
[Chorus]
[2Pac]
(This is) This is for the critics if you live up
Pick up my shit or I'll be back doin stickups
I better see five stars next to my picture
If not, Tupac will cop the glock and come knockin to getcha
I told you once motherfucker I'm a nut
Play me like a butt and you'll be bleedin when you're fucked
Niggaz know what's up but they be tryin to hold me down
I'm comin outta Oaktown, bitch fuck around
And it ain't where you from that makes you hardcore
Nigga it's the way you throw them thangs in the war
And to the marks that be talkin all that shit
Screamin out the next nigga's name like a bitch
And the niggaz that I ran into recently
The motherfuckers at the club that pulled the piece on me
You little bitches shoulda pulled the fuckin trigga
Now you live in fear of a heartless-ass nigga
Mr. Troublesome; niggaz tried to play me with the gat
but like Terminator nigga, I'll be back
Yeah!  And I'll be back with a fuckin army
You tried to harm me -- ruh-ring the alarm G!
Cause most motherfuckers love to act up
without they backup, when they get jacked up they crack up
It's strictly for my niggaz at the show
so they know, not to play me like a ho (ho!!!)
Strictly for my...

Strugglin, jugglin, got it to the black man
Eatin the scams like I was motherfuckin Pac Man
Cops step off, you know the flavor
They fear the ruffneck niggaz with the lunatic behavior
And now we gotta eat, gotta make ends meet
Stabbin for a fee, it gets hard on the fuckin streets
It's like a madness, fuck making gravy
I rhyme and do crimes, cuz either way pays me
A little rough with a hardcore... theme
Couldn't rough something rougher in your... dreams
Mad rugged so you know we're gonna... rip
With that roughneck nigga named 2Pacalypse
Representing YG'z yo
Flip Stretch Homicide and my nigga Gambino
Seek and Po can't forget Money Bags
Stickin up spots and jumpin in Jags
Gotta get ahead and always stay bumblin
And always keep a hand on the gat
Cuz a niggaz straight strugglin
[Verse Two: Live Squad]
I used to be on tour, but now I'm sick of strugglin
I thought about bumpin, but mother-fuck jugglin
I know it lasts longer, gets my pockets thicker
But I'd rather use my gun cause I get the money quicker, so bust it
Look as I cut the records hard to eject
A quick clip threw my body down uhh! it's another hit
I got energy to blast now you want the task here
Cuz of the light a motherfucker shot that ass up
But rugged and rough is how I'm steppin
Mac is the weapon, and it's always kept in
Eye on the Mac cause the dogg got it goin on
If you come up steppin you'll be lit like a hick
So you better chill, cause I got too much money to get
A street thug in the motherfuckin house, I'm strugglin
Get drunk but I don't think
I'm just in it for the money, don't be a punk snitch
When I yank up my gun, don't run don't bitch
Cause ya know if you do, you'll be layin in a ditch
You'll get your stupid ass blown out the frame
Cause I'm playing to win, and survive in the game
I'm strugglin
[Verse Three: 2Pac]
Big up, big up, got him in the frame, bang
Ain't nothin changed set it off I let the brains hang
Guess who's back, to put niggaz on they back
Till I call back, niggaz runnin free better fall back
I'm fifty niggaz deep beat sleep
with a Mossberg wrapped in my seats
three deep in my Jeep chief run with the Young Gunz
Strugglin and strivin, that's how the dough come
Now get gunned by the one with the gun for the low goal
Throw a bolo so low when I flow yo
Much too high to read the signs, I'm blind
Clickin on the nine, out to get mine
I go big up, big up, gotta make the room, boom
Blowin motherfuckers to the moon
Niggaz need to feel me a real G, home from the bumblin
See me on the block, strugglin
And rollin with the roughnecks nuff checks cashed
I get in niggaz ass, blast

Rhymin and stealin, sellin five million

Fresh out on bail, ni**az still can't see me

That's how it is
Now we got a new motherf**kin plan, and a new mission
(Makaveli the Don, Greg Nice, Outlaw - Outlaw)
Competition, so they say, these ni**az is gay
(Outlaw - Outlaw)
Blast me?  It could never happen
At least not while I'm walkin and rappin
Heard of some ni**az on the other side of town who wanna ride wit me
(Throw ya hands up, hands up)
They can't hide, listen to the rough s**t, my click
(Throw ya motherf**kin hands up)
I said many times busters still can't see
Y'all ni**az can't f**k with me (Outlaw)

Y'all ni**az can't f**k with me (Outlaw)
I been, handlin stress in this s**t for years
Blazed out sheddin tattooed tears
Now, Rock-a-bye baby, I'm thugged out and so crazy
Don't want to hurt a soul ni**a, so don't make me
I got a dream to see my whole team in Lexus Coupes
My enemies dead n buried, now the stress is through
But that's a dream, though it seems like reality; there'll 
never be peace long as there's fiends on these Cali streets
Even on the other side brothers die, but ride
ni**az get high off a slow form of suicide
Hide the closest thoughts, the war is fought as casualties
I live my life to f**kin mo', exposin tragically
How can we find some peace and ni**az still ain't get a piece
I know I'm probably hellbound, but we got to eat
I'm seeing Satin infiltratin; my military mind 
make me hustle all the time, go out for cash makin
Forgive my adversaries they don't understand what we go through
to become a man, we sheddin tattoed tears

I been, handlin stress in this s**t for years
Blazed out sheddin tattooed tears; now, I
said many times busters still can't see
Y'all ni**az can't f**k with me (Outlaw)
I been, handlin stress in this s**t for years
Blazed out sheddin tattooed tears
[2Pac]
 Thugged out baby!
[Young Noble]
We don't shed tears we shed blood
Do you still wanna be a thug? HUH? WHAT?
We don't shed tears we shed blood
Do you still wanna be a thug?
Yo, criminal ways of thinkin made me crave Abe Lincolns
The days I spent stinkin caught victims on the weekends
Seeking a better path, expose a better half of me
Blast for me, the task after me
For a few years sheddin tattooed tears
like Gram' Sammy, we feudin for the whole damn family
We scarred up, homies is barred up for mad time
Outlawz locked down for some past crimes
Fast dimes made my stash grow smaller
Your block ain't no harder, fake baller
[Napoleon]
ni**a it's like this
I been thuggin just for the cause of it
Out to get all of it, but I'll never loose my balls and s**t
And it's all for the pressure
that'll make me cock my s**t up off the dresser
Made ni**a mafia of course my ni**as gonna test ya
Answers to the questions, bullets to my Smith N' Wesson
Still stucked up in a f**k session, Jersey where the ni**az flexin
Po-po's guessin if the stolen car gonna do a drive-by
Wet em up from his shoulders, leave him bye-bye
Now mama cry-cry, but it ain't my time to either die-die
So ask me why-why, but I feel that God owe me my life
for the things he did, but I turn my pleasure into sin
Blazed out sheddin tattoed tears
[Chorus]
[Kadafi]
s**t.. ain't no unity in my community it's do or die
Seein my opprunities through these bars of hell while gettin high
as life replays like time; underhanded schemes 
to get that cream and thangs while livin this life of crime
My enemies want me squeezed
They get dumped like 3's, with 57 wasted at they knees
Please beware we thugs revolution size
Criminals dare be last mental me intitutionalize
Locked down, got many shell shocked, now
Holdin down fort like I'm stuck in court cell block style
[Kastro]
Yo I been loosin sleep, stay awake way past late
Visions of killers en ma*se at the blast mayne
As I lay here gatted down and tatted
Knowin now it's hard to slow down for a addict
It's been years of stugglin, guzzlin beers
Beefin and never even, ain't no love in the air
And I suffer my s**t in hell, talkin to the heavens
Walkin thru the valley of death with my fellas
I lost a lot, startin with hope I tried
And for every tattoo I got a moment I cried
I'm thru with the lies, the two in my eyes, yell pain
Step in my shoes, nuttin to lose, but my brain
I'ma hold it down tho', with all the struggle to bear
Ain't nothing to fear, cryin these tattooed tears
Come on...

Teardrops And Closed Caskets 
[2Pac]
(hahhh, hahaha) Hehehe, word
It's like all we got left - teardrops and closed caskets
(throw it up fool, hey ni**a, haha)
Tell me how you feel homey
(Yeah, it took a week to go down)
You recollects and see how crazy it sounds
The whole town's on a mission, adolescents (penitentary bound)
(Now introducin Young Trigga)
Since birth, eyes set on gettin bigger
Just anotha wild-a*s ni**a
(But he was fiendin for Precious) WHAT?
(But Precious was a ghetto girl)
Couldn't be no sex without that gold Lexus
(But Lil' Trigga was heartbroken, he had to get his papers)
Seein visions of people smokin and ni**az catchin vapors
Got his man from around the corner (we'll call him Lil' Mo)
(Been in so many reform schools they had to let him go)
(Here's where the plot thickens)
They got a plot to make a profit with they glocks spittin
(They call the squad, hittin blocks with they guns blowin)
(Somebody's gonna die tonight)
Still no one's knowin, so they kept goin
Catchin dealers comin out they cars (will they survive?)
(Two semi-automatic nines, them ni**az died)
(Plus nobody in the hood cries, it's like they celebrate
to death and wish they could die) So peep the lesson
But wait a minute back to Precious
She's snortin dope in the back seat of Trigg's Lexus
TEARDROPS AND CLOSED CASKETS

 TEARDROPS AND CLOSED CASKETS
[Nate]
 Will I.. forever be alone
[Pac]
 Teardrops and closed caskets
(Don't let these ghetto streets get you, Precious)
(was the victim, from a dime to a nickel)
Hopin God's blessings stick with ya
Picture the neighborhood kingpin, who's gettin bigger
Familiar face, but a man now, it's Lil' Trigga
Now Lil' Mo was a soldier to the fullest
Down for his homies, always the first to spit bullets
(All he wanted was to be a thug)
Never pictured his truest homeboy would fall in love
(Here's where it gets ya)
Now Precious is pregnant, Lil' Trigga is happy
He wants to marry her now (not knowin he ain't the daddy)
But Precious was lonely while Lil' Trigga was makin dough
She's slippin in secret places and gettin with Lil' Mo
The neighborhood's buzzin, now people are talkin
Lil' Trigga's gettin pictures of the both of 'em walkin
(Hand in hand, couldn't understand)
How his baby's mama could disapear with another man
(and his best friend)
Now jealousy's dangerous, and if you don't believe me
Then watch the way that this story ends and maybe you'll see
There ain't no heroes or villains, ain't no pleasure in killin
Just the smoke from the cap peelin a man with no feelings
TEARDROPS AND CLOSED CASKETS
[Nate]
 Will I.. forever be alone
[Pac]
 Teardrops and closed caskets
Bury you dead and look ahead
A man with no feelings

 Teardrops and closed caskets
That's all we got left, that's all
[Outlawz]
Now with the problems of poverty
and the tricks to these tales
How many people'll die
how many'll live to tell
Although best friends before
Lil' Trigga and Mo
(They in an all out war, over a fiend they ain't know)
Behind the curtains their privacy lust is already laid down
The results is the same with different names and it turns out
[2Pac]
Y'all know how it is, same old thing in the same old town
Lil' Trigg got his nose wide open on this one trick, now he's played out
Think it's Lil' Mo (was plottin plans on gettin bigger)
(Precious was his way to put his hands on Lil' Trigga)
All the while let's look at Precious
Too dumb to see what's goin down (too doped up to ask questions)
Used to be comrades (but now we blast on sight)
What could be so bad (God, will we last tonight?)
From misdemeanors to felonies, small-time to sellin ki's
I can't believe the s**t they tellin me
They open fire, three bodies drop, so call the cops
(Precious, Lil' Mo and Trigg)
TEARDROPS AND CLOSED CASKETS

Temptations 
Yo Mo Bee main, drop that shit!
"Heyyyy!  Heyy-ayyaahhyy" -- 
[Erick Sermon]
 (Redman's "Watch Yo' Nugget")
[sample repeats until first verse]
You know what time, boo-yaow
I know it's time for you
So grab one by the hand youknowhatI'msayin
And uhh, throw up that finger
Ay yo yo yo throw y'all fingers up!
Thug style baby, Thug style y'know?
[Verse One:]
Tell me baby are you lonely?  Don't wanna rush ya
I can help ya if ya only, let me touch ya
If I'm wrong love tell me, cause I get caught up
and the life I live is Hell see, I never thought I'd see
the day when I would calm down, you ain't heard
I've been known to clown and Get Around, that's my word
See you walkin and you lookin good, yes indeed
Got a body like a sex fiend, you're killin me
witcha attitude to match right, don't be phony
cause I hate when you act like, you don't know me
I've be stressin in the spotlight, I want the fame
but the industry's a lot like, a crap game
Ain't no time for commitment, I gotta go
Can't be wit you every minute miss, another show
And even though I'm known for my one night stand
I wanna be an honest man, but temptations go...
"Heyyyy!  Heyy-ayyaahhyy" -- 
[Erick Sermon]
 (Redman's "Watch Yo' Nugget")
[sample repeats until second verse]
Throw up the finger!
And all my homies go..
Throw them the finger!
Ya know what baby it's like
[singing]
I know you've been searchin for someone
To make you happy, and get the job done
You say you need it, a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care
[Verse Two:]
Will I cheat or will I be committed, heaven knows
Gettin weak and I wanna hit it, so here I go
in my ride and I'm all in, gettin high
I can hear the people callin, I'm passin by
Everybody knows I'm ball-in, and to God
Gotta keep myself from fall-in, but it's hard
All the cuties know I'm under pressure, what do I do
Gettin shaky when she pull the dress up, and say it's cool
Should I stroke or should I wait a while, you decide
If you tell me that you don't want it, that's a lie
Move close and let me whisper, some dirty words
in your ears as I kiss ya, on every curve
Slow down baby don't rush, I like it slow
Can't hold it any longer, so let it go
Open the gates, do you wanna fall up in heaven
Don't worry, I let myself in, all I heard was...
"Heyyyy!  Heyy-ayyaahhyy" -- 
[Erick Sermon]
 (Redman's "Watch Yo' Nugget")
[sample repeats until third verse]
Give em the finger!
All my homies go..
Throw your fingers up!
That's just the Thug in me girl, you know
Peep out all my homies, y'know, it's like
[singing]
I know you've been searchin for someone
To make you happy, and get the job done
You say you need it, a man with money
But I can't be there, and will you still care
[Verse Three:]
A lot of people think it's easy, to settle down
Got a woman that'll please me, in every town
I don't wanna but I gotta do it, the temptation
got me ready to release the fluid, sensation
sit down and conversate like you know me, take my hand
Cause even Thugs get lonely, understand
Even the hardest of my homies need attention
Catch you blowin up the telephone, reminiscin
I wanna take you to the movies, and the park
Let's find a spot for you to do me, in the dark
Now that it's passion, hold me tight
Don't need lights, I can see you by the moonlight
I know your man ain't lovin you right
You're lonely and depressed you need a Thug in your life
Enough talkin, you want me to leave, I'll get to walkin
See you later, cause baby I'm a player, and all I heard was
"Heyyyy!  Heyy-ayyaahhyy" -- 
[Erick Sermon]
 (Redman's "Watch Yo' Nugget")
[sample repeats until the end]
Give em the finger
And all my homies go.. yo this how we gonna do this in the nine-trey y'know?
Throw your fingers up
Y'know?  They gonna peep this, this how we run game on you

Ohh shit!  Jumped on my man's dick
Heard he had a twelve inch, now the bitch is lovesick
Who's to blame, the guy or the groupie?
Heard I was down with D.U., now she wants to do me
Oooh-wee!  This is the life
New bitch every night, never tripped off a wife
It ain't right, but it's cool how they come quick
Don't try to flip with the lip cause I run shit
Hip hip, hooray for the AK
Spray when I lay competition, what a great day
Make pay, next is the wet sex
Hexed with the vex now they wreck with the complex
I'm set, wonder what I tote, check
Bloody as a coat-check, snappin motherfuckers necks
Revenge so sweet when it comes from
niggaz get done with the drum, watch my foes run
Nigga keeps comin when they can't slip
Full of that shit, another hit from Tha' Lunatic
[Stretch]
Yeah, fuck that God!  Word up
Blowin niggaz out the motherfuckin frame yaknahmsayin?
Constantly.. fuck that trick, we ain't havin it
[Tupac]
Leave me the fuck alone, you gets none of this
It's suicidal, you lose your title like Doug-las
Cause I'm nothin nice and, I'm icin like Tyson
I'm grippin the mic and, my DJ is slicin
I'm tired of motherfuckers steppin to me with the SAME OLD
Tryin to do me like Nintendo
How the fuck you think I ever got this far?
By bootin motherfuckers like a shootin star
Cause I'm out to show, that I'm a dope MC
Think crack had you fiendin, wait'll they get a load of me
Bitches on my dick, like a motherfuckin 'conda
Niggaz wanna flip, let em step, and I'll bomb em
See somethin you want, why don't you come and get it
And then get waxed and taxed, like the government
Then I leave you sittin there, wonder where your money went
While your bitch is callin me, tellin me to come again
Nigga I'm loc'ed, when I smoke, from the indo
But we can be friends though, after you get broke like a window
That's what you provoked, and now you're smoked out
Lookin like a bitch, cause your whole fuckin posse, broke out
Punk motherfucker couldn't roll on
He couldn't hold on, game is too strong, nigga
Leave me the fuck alone, you gets none of this
Feel the wrath.. and revenge of Tha' Lunatic
[Stretch]
Yeah Tu', tell them motherfuckers, word up
We ain't havin it, NONE of that shit!!
Bitch ass niggaz, niggaz can't fuck with us Tu', word up

Niggaz got PROBLEMS in ninety-one
Ninety-two, and ninety-three
and all that other shit, word up!
[Tupac]
Recognize game when it smacks your bitch I'm back to rip
Puttin this on the map with this mackin shit
Time will tell if it's made well
Well I raise hell and excel cause it pays well
Jordan couldn't dunk it any harder, pump it any farther
I'm funky, that's word to the father
Act like you know 'fore I thump, the bolo
Thought you was a pimp, now you're simpin for my solo
Oh no, not another new jack, swearin that he's ruthless
Ducked, and now he's fucked and left toothless
I can hear the fear in your flow, you ain't prepared
You're scared and you're bound to go
It's somethin, I guess I let the beat keep bumpin
Stop trippin off these niggaz cause they ain't about nuttin
Or should I say NAYthin
Punk put my tape in, fuck all the fake-in
I'm sick of the bullshit
Come equipped and get ready to rip
or get the dick of Tha' Lunatic

The Good Die Young 
[Talk]
These is hard times we livin' in
Churches burnin, planes fallin from the sky
Murder, the good die young
The good definitely die young
This is a lil' somethin' 
To help you get through the day
If you could
It was more than a tragedy
Emotions be grabbin' me
Plane fell from the sky
We tryin' to figure what happened
Burnin' churches, fearin' God
Who can be so cruel
We all ignorant to AIDS
Till it happens to you
Just be a man, make plans
Listen to your voice
A woman's tryin' to make decisions
We should leave them a choice
Cause who are we to say who lives and die
Breathes and stops
All this judgement on other lives
Needs to stop
What are we livin' for
Givin' more back than takin'
On my knees still waitin' for my own salvation
Now I feel abandoned
cause Pat Bucanan say I'm greedy
You can take my taxes, send me to war
But can't feed me
It's so easy to regret things
After they done
Babies catchin' murder cases
Scared to laugh in the sun
The tragedies that we all need
Love in doses
In times like these we feel closest
The good die young
Does anybody have an answer why
It seems the good die young
Can anybody tell me why
Can anybody tell me why 
[2x]
Now in my world will it get worse
When I been trapped since birth
But I had to sleep in a hearse
Cause it was my bed first
My grands probably burnin'
Turnin' in they grave
Some folks ain't even get to see a high age
But they did so I ain't afraid
And this money got me feelin like a star
And this murder got me 
Feelin like my death ain't far
And the land (?) and stolen cars
Don't get no better
Don't get no weaker or no harder
I was raised in a rush without my moms
And my father
So tell me somethin
If I grab my gat and get the dumpin'
Would God get to lookin' at me funny
Rest in peace to my mother Aquillah Beale
Rest in peace to my father Salek Beale
Rest in peace to my grandparents
And thug in peace to my brother Seike
You know I love you
Witch world first storms (?) and then Al
Pac and then Yak
Redrey (?) Brown
Coulda' sworn I seen ya face in a cloud
Family grievin' on your last breath
Close to the heart whether you know it or not
I swear the love won't stop
Jewel, that's my boo
Mom, Duke and Lou
From jump
You kept it true, helped to feed the crew
The good die young
Livin' fast jumpin' the gun
Mama blamin' the community for killin' her son
My cousin Darren wasn't scared of goin'
But never knowin' he was dyin' slower
I guess I see ya when I see ya soulja
Does anybody have an answer why
It seems the good die young
Can anybody tell me why
Can anybody tell me why
I know my life ain't promised
That's why the wise move in silence
Analize these scandalous times
It's hard dogg but we manage
Schools turn to war zones
Even homes unsafe
Leavin' children to play caged and raged
They hate, how come
Someone explain why the good die young
Why the bad die slow and outlive everyone
It's time somethin' is done
For our young kids
They growin' opus (??)
That ain't the way to live
Tell me why
Days go past and as they pa*s
Time move quicker
No time for wastin'
Put your hustle down my young dealers
Cause the end is nearer
But at least that's what they tellin' me
Hell, all I know brothers
Ain't ridin' 4 3 felonys
It's time to plan, plot, and strategize
Capitolize, mobilize
We in the war y'all
It's for all y'all
My family to the ones that stabbed (?) me
Little bit mo' love is what's recommended
Yeah, and it's plain to see
The seeds from you and me
Gon' be the ones to lead us towards unity
That's if we treat them right
Man, teach them right
Raise your kids better than you was
And see what it does
But if you don't
Man, we sho' to be done
We'll all see exactly why the good die young
Does anybody have an answer why
It seems the good die young
Can anybody tell me why
Can anybody tell me why

This is for all my homeboys that pa*sed away
And all yo' homeboys that pa*sed away

That's in the cemetaries buried
Never got to see they dreams
For everything I touch you touch
For every step I take you take
For every breath I breather you breathe
Every dollar I make you make
I told you we'd make it to the sunshine one day
You just got there a little quicker
But like my homeboys Thugs say
I'll catch ya at the crossroads

Young kids and people that are innocent
That died young

Is it, money or women to funny beginnings, tragic endings
I can make a million and STILL not get enough of spending
And since my life is based on sinnin, I'm hellbound
Rather be buried than be worried, livin held down
My game plan to be trained and, military
Mind of a Thug Lord, sittin in the cemetary
Caught, I've been lost since my adolescence, callin to Jesus
Ballin as a youngster, wonderin if he sees us
Young black male, crack sales got me three strikes
Livin in jail, this is hell, enemies die
Wonder when we all pass is anybody listenin?
Got my, hands on my semi shotty, everybody's bitchin
Please God can you understand me, bless my family
Guide us all, before we fall into insanity
I make it a point, to make my peep bumpin warlike
Drop some shit, to have these stupid bitches jaws tight.
[Chorus: 50 Cent + (2Pac)]
'Til Makaveli returns, it's +All Eyez On Me+

And you can hate it or love it, but that's what it's gon' be

You shoulda listened, I told you not to fuck with me
(What do we have here NOWWW?)
Now can you take the pressure, that's what we gon' see

[Verse Two: 50 Cent]
Now since you're cryin for mercy I promise
My success'll be the death of you
Lo and behold you sold your soul
Nigga there's nuttin left of you
Look in the mirror, ask yourself who are you?
If you don't know who you are, how could your dreams come true?
Motherfucker, I sat back and watched
You pretended to be 'Pac, you pretended to be hot
But you're not (NOWWWW) - I see it so clear
You can't take the pressure, you pussy
I warned you not to push me
You see me and chills run up your spine
Hardly even in the same war, but your heart ain't like mine
Press, they look at me like I'm a menace
I was playin with guns
while your momma had your punk ass playin tennis
I'm a nightmare, you see me when you dream
Wake up, turn on your TV and see my ass again
You cowardly hearted, you couldn't make it on your own
Fuck THE SOURCE, I'm on cover of Rolling Stone

was I somebody they despise
curious look in they eyes
as if they wonder if i'm dead or alive
poor momma can't control me
quit tryin' ta save my soul, I wanna roll with my homies
a ticken timebomb
can't nobody fade me
packin' a 380
and fiendin' for my mercedes
suckers scatter
but it don't matter i'm a cool shot
punks drop from all tha buckshots tha fools got
i'm tired of being a nice guy
i've been poor all my life, but don't know quite why
so they label me a lunatic 
could care less
death or success
is what I quest
cause i'm fearless
now tha streetz R Deathrow
[Chorus]
(cause i'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
tha streetz R Deathrow
(cause i'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
tha streetz R Deathrow
I just murdered a man, i'm even more stressed
wearin' a vest
hopein' that their aimin' at my chest
much too young to bite tha bullet
hand on tha trigga 
I see my life before my eyes each time I pull it
I hope I live to be a man
must be part of some big plan to keep a brotha in tha state
penn
counting pennys over tha years
I'd done stacked many
proven wrong those
who swore i'd wouldn't live till twenty
now they gotta cope
since it's tha only thing I know
it's difficult to let it go
i'm startin' to loose my hair cause I worry
hustlin' to keep from gettin' buried
but now I gotta move away now
cause these suckers wanna spray where I lay down
my homie lost his family and snapped
shot up half tha block to bring them back
tha streetz R Deathrow
[Chorus]
(cause i'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
tha streetz R Deathrow
(cause i'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
tha streetz R Deathrow
(cause i'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
tha streetz R Deathrow
(cause i'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
(like it ain't nothin')
i'm dangerous
when drunk I only drink beer
gin makes me sin
unable to think clear
heneesee, makes me think my enemy is getting close
BOOM BOOM BOOM 
got me shooting at a ghost
some call me crazy
but this is what you gave me
amongst tha babies, who raised up from tha slavery
I sport a vest and hit tha sess to kill tha stress
moved out west and I invest in all tha best
those who test will find a bullet in they chest
put ta rest
by a brotha who was hopeless
grow up broke on tha rope of insanity
how many pistols smoking coming from a broken family
i'm sick of being tired
sick of tha sirens, body bags, and tha gun firing
tell bush to push tha button cause i'm fed
tired of hearin' these voices in my head
tha streetz R Deathrow
[Chorus]
(cause i'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
tha streetz R Deathrow
(cause i'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
tha streetz R Deathrow
(cause i'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
tha streetz R Deathrow
(cause i'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
tha streetz R Deathrow
(cause i'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
this goes out to my partners in tha Live Squad (like it
ain't nothin')
and all my partners involved in that 187
watch your back...
(cause i'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
There got to be a better way...
(cause i'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
There's too many of us in tha cemetary
(cause i'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')
come on, what we gonna do now
(cause i'll beat you down, like it ain't nothin')

The Uppercut 
(feat. E.D.I. and Young Noble of the Outlawz)
[Intro: Tupac Talking]
I wanted to bring back that reality, nobody can ever be confused and think I'm fuckin Mike Tyson
and I'm the heavyweight champion, I'm a little nigga, thats why its so raw to just watch me
battle lions, cause I'm a little skinny nigga battlin' niggas three times my size
Watch this uppercut, here it comes... watch the jab nigga...ugh...here it come, look out, watch
my arms...
[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now see so many motherfuckers wanna take a peice
Commin' equipped with some shit that niggas just cant believe
I pull a trick from my sleeve now kamikazee
I'm all over that nigga, come identify the body
My middle finger to you hoe niggas
Run up on me, and i'll be forced to let it go nigga
I aint the one you wanna try, why, stayin' high
I hit this blunt and watch these motherfuckers die
Whose runnin these streets I said that cocaine
Cause in the the dope game, niggas'll die 'fore they go broke mayne
Another hustler makin' major cash
'til the punk police come an raid ya ass
Now you stressed doin' fed time, and its a bitch
Cause the judge gave you 8 years, you doin 6
And we know that you can't hang, you a trick
Rolled over turned snitch like a biatchhhh
[Chorus (x1): 2Pac]
Now you know you shoulda ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin from the uppercut, fucked, so what's up? nigga!
Now you know you shoulda ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin' from this uppercut, stuck, so what's up? nigga!
[Verse 2: 2Pac]
They got a nigga in the dice game, I'm feelin' lucky
But the nigga just a little bigger, he tryin fuck me
Out my cash, imma blast nigga, he don't know
I gotta tell ya like the last nigga, gotta go
Don't need to roll for the truck, I get em' up
Left to right, my uppercut'll hit em' up (ha)
I'm known to walk the streets on any block
I love my niggas, but I aint puttin down my glock
The gun shots rang when I lose nigga, and ooh nigga
Imma show you not to ever play a true nigga (haha)
Lay it down just to prove it
And fuck the rappin motherfucker we can do this
[Chorus (x1): 2Pac]
Now you know you shoulda ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin from the uppercut, fucked, so what's up? nigga!
Now you know you shoulda ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin' from this uppercut, stuck, so what's up? nigga!
[Verse 3: Outlawz (EDI 
&
 Young Noble)]
They claim that we violent, we named after tyrants
This revolution won't be televised, we keep it silent (shh)
Roll on our enemies, beat em' at they own game
Molotov cocktails, release an up in flames
Tired of bein' stepped on, sick of bein' held back
Lookin' through my rear view, thinkin' bout the pay back
Wanna see my kids grow don't know if imma make it though
One more nigga came up short in the ghetto
Society lied to me so i'm strapped with the metal
Push ya middle finger up nigga if you a rebel
Have ya face down goin' in ya pockets if ya let em'
I done lost too many homies for me to ever forget em'
I done made so many mistakes but still I dont regret em'
I'm a product of the pimp, the pusher, and the reverend
I'm a product of the block, the fiends, and the felons
We all lost souls tryina find our way to heaven
[Chorus (x1): 2Pac]
Now you know you shoulda ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin from the uppercut, fucked, so what's up? nigga!
Now you know you shoulda ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin' from this uppercut, stuck, so what's up? nigga!
[Outro: Edi Talking]
To all the conrads no longer with us, see you when we get there
'Pac, Yak, we gon' keep on ridin', give these cowards the uppercut
'Til we get up there with ya'll, YOU KNOW!..
Thug Life we still livin it
Outlaw for life, in the name of the Don, let's go!

They Don't Give A Fuck About Us 
(feat. Outlawz)
Y'all ain't never just tripped and pictured 
And just looked at the whole situation 
Cause once u look at it 
You know 
(really do) 
They don't give a fuck about us 
They don't give a fuck about us 
They don't give a fuck about us 
Thuggin' till the day I die 
They don't give a fuck about us 
And when I start to rise 
A hero in their children's eyes 
Now they give a fuck about us 
[Tupac]
Some say niggaz is hard headed cause we love to trick 
Equipped with game so we bang wit this thuggish shit 
I see you trying to hide 
Hoping that nobody don't notice 
You must always remember you still a member of the hopeless 
See ya black like me 
So you snap like me 
When these devils try to plot 
Trap our young black seeds 
Look it 
Cops are just as crooked as the niggas they chasin' 
Lookin' for role models 
Our father figures is bases 
Some say they expect Illuminati take my body to sleep 
Niggas at the party with they shotties 
Just as rowdy as me 
Before I flee computer chips 
I gotta deal wit brothas flippin 
I don't see no devils bleedin' 
Only black blood drippin 
We can change 
Whatcha now say? 
I'm watchin niggaz work their lives out without pay (huh) 
Whatever it takes to switch places wit the bustas on top 
I'm bustin' shots make the world stop 
They don't give a fuck about us 
[Chorus]
And if I choose to ride 
Thuggin' till the day I die 
(Nobody) 
Cause they don't give a fuck about us 
But when I start to rise 
A hero in they children's eyes 
Now they give a fuck about us 
And if I choose to ride 
Thuggin' till the day I die 
Nobody gives a fuck about us 
But when I start to rise 
A hero in they children's eyes 
Now they give a fuck about us 
[EDI]
It's the morning after and now all the laughter is gone 
Time to reflect on what you did cause they saying you wrong 
I'm sure you had your reasons dawg 
I don't doubt you 
See the simple fact of the matter is they don't give a fuck about you 
Or them five mouths you forced to feed (uh-huh) 
No including yourself 
All you want is what they perceiving as greed 
So as you loaded up that mack and continue to buck em 
I was on paper 
Thinking they don't give a fuck about us 
[Tupac]
I'm seeing it clearer 
Hating the picture in the mirror 
They claim we inferior 
So why the fuck these devils fear ya? 
I'm watching my nation die genocide the cause 
Expect a blood bath 
The aftermath is y'alls 
I told ya last album, we need help cause we dying 
Give us a chance, help us advance cause we trying 
Ignore my whole plea, watching us in disgust 
And then they beg when my guns bust 
They don't give a fuck about us 
[Chorus x2]
And if I choose to ride 
Thuggin' till the day I die 
Nobody gives a fuck about us 
But when I start to rise 
A hero in they children's eyes 
Now they give a fuck about us 
[Kastro]
Now all my homies got love for me 
Down to catch a slug for me 
Guaranteed to bleed deeply 
Now that's love 
Shit 
Nobody else could give a fuck 
If I'm tore down, from the floor down 
Six-feet deep in the cut 
What the fuck done went wrong 
How long will I be mourned? 
When I'm gone, same song 
Ain't gave a fuck all along 
And who am I to blame em? 
Just do or die through the rainin' 
Since they don't give a fuck 
I don't 
Feel what I'm saying? 
[Kadafi]
Now thug niggaz die but multiply in doubles 
Wrapped in plastic 
Or closed casket for our troubles 
Pressed in times 
We busted like bubbles 
With the police 
This nation's peace sent here to run you 
Now look at what this crooked world has come to 
I grew up on the other side of perfect, a life of hurtin' 
Man I still hustle, so I'm dyin certain 
So I spent your time in poor and working 
I see no reason 
So I stay ballin' season to season 
Why you stuck thinking that they give a fuck? 
[Napolean]
You tell me my world is in peace, but nigga your lying 
Cause half of my niggas, long gone, buried in the dirt just for trying 
Sometimes I think my block is dying 
And that it's awful 
To wake up to another day, shit ain't change that all fool 
I wake up sweatin, dreamin, coughin 
Seein' me upside down backwards head twisted 
While I'm layin in the coffin 
The shit comes around so often 
So tell me something 
Before I take it out on the world, and get to dumpin' 
Nigga I been so through pain go through the struggle 
Doin the same thing you did at my age and that's hustlin 
On the edge of straight bustin' 
Well since you don't give a fuck 
I be frontin 
And I'ma drink my Hennessey like it ain't nothin 
[Outro x2]
Now if I choose to ride, thuggin' till the day I die 
They don't give a fuck about us 
While I'm kickin rhymes, getting to their children's minds 
Now they give a fuck about us 
They wanna see us die, they kick us every time we try 
They don't give a fuck about us 
So while I'm getting high, I'm watching as the world goes by 
Cause they don't give a fuck about us

This Ain't Livin 
This ain't livin..
[2Pac]
Nigga - I hear even the smaller G's be dippin Chevy Impalas
while flossin they gold D's, O.G.'s, is who they follow
We (?)swallow tomorrow(?) see, what we leave is hollow
We feed violence and greed, let 'em bleed tomorrow
In time, they grip a nine, sippin wine - hit grass
'til I be starin watch the parents sacrifice they child
The love's gone, a thug's home, with no love
Feelin so strong, make young boys into drug lords
Now one for adolescents, now dos for dose
Keep yo' friends by your side, even close your foes
Now three for Johnny Law tryin to make my chips
I never pulled the trigger, didn't touch that bitch
Throw yo' hands in the air, it's a robbery
.. thinkin 'Pac, would you ride with me
Let's go see what our enemies talkin bout
When G's enter the house nobody's walkin out
This ain't livin, it's similar to prison, we trapped
My homies jealous plus they tell us that the phones is tapped
I watch my back twenty-fo' seven
and never let a busta send a G to ghetto heaven, you know!
This is how it goes when we floss with foes
Before I toss yo' hoe, it'll cost you mo'
I do shows make a lot of dough, murder my foes
But I'd give it all up, if it would help you grow
This ain't livin
[Chorus 2X: sung]
Takes a life to make a life (takes a life)
Livin in the world of crime tonight (takes a life)
Can't find a better way to break you
This ain't livin I gotta do what I gotta do
[2Pac]
Peep it - gunfire is produced at alarmin rates
Today's youth, grip the shit, get in the car and break
"It Takes a Nation of Millions" if we intend to stop the killin
Just search your feelings, participate in some (?)
They our seeds and when they bleed, we bleed
That's what becomes of lonely children, they turn to G's
Heavenly father can you rescue, my young nation
rest the Lord will protect you, respect due
Not a threat as I step in blue, and check those
that oppose when I froze them fools, and who are you
to watch me fall farther
I disappeared, reappeared as the .. follow me now
Skippin class, and livin fast, will get yo' ass
stuck in the pen, doin life plus ten
Young brother pump yo' brakes for me, before you choke
won't ya soak up some game from yo' big homies
This ain't livin, we givin you jewelsl, use 'em as tools
Explode on they industry and fade them fools
You know the rules, gotta be a rider
You can run the red lights but read the street signs, heyy
This for all of y'all that keep on raisin hell
Put a pistol in your hand and let you fade yourself
It ain't right, what you put your momma through, young G
Gotta change your life, take the game from me
This ain't livin
[Chorus - 2X]

And crooked cops

I want money in large amounts 
My garage full of cars that bounce 
Movin' my tapes in major ways 
Cause every dollar counts 
Bustas is jealous 
And half these nigas is punks 
They runnin' off at the mouth 
'Till I fill up with my pump 
They jump 
My automatic keep 'em weary 
While you fronting like you Billy bad ass 
Nigga you scary 
I been knowing you for years 
We was high school peers 
In Junior High 
I was itchin' to kill 
And you was ready to die 
While you bullshitting 
Niggas was dying and catching cases 
Busting my automatics at motherfuckers in foreign places 
Leaving no trace 
They see my face and then they buried 
Them bitches die in a hurry 
Still I ride 
I'm never worried 
Mr. Makaveli 
Tell me to ride and I'ma ride 
Pick my enemies out the crowd 
And muthafuckas die 
It's not the way I wanna live 
My nigga 
It's how it is 
Homie got into a fight 
Last night they killed his kids 
[Chorus x2]
In this life I lead 
Fiend for currency 
Get high off weed

Make my enemies bleed 
When you see me nigga 
Holla my set

Outlaw mother fuckers 
'Till we die 
In this life I lead 
[Verse 2: Young Noble]
I ain't a killer but don't push me dog 
For that family I'll send that ass straight to God (what you doing nigga?) 
And in this life I lead 
I've seen the most 
Of my 23 years 
My vision is blurry 
The money is clear 
Some of my peers 
Eternally will sleep in a coffin (yeah nigga) 
And noble on the road 
I'm extremely cautious (westside nigga you know how we do it) 
It happened that fast 
Split second your gone 
At the top of my tombstone 
Put noble is raw 
Outlaw 
'Till I'm under the floor 
For Kadafi the prince 
I stack dough like a clock on the bricks 
With a watch on my wrist dog 
I know the time these days 
We outlaws 
We gonna die this way (nigga) 
We already in the history books 
Pac made sure of that 
Whateva you took

You know it's all for the foundation

And the nigga talking crazy

Him or *censored* for killing babies 
I'm a New Jers' Devil

Only got one shot to produce 
On every level 
This is Maximus 
Go to the max I must 
Nigga I came from not much 
So money I clutch 
Uhuh 
Napolean the strength of strong arm 
With a dick they whistle and ride 
I put a move up on 
I'm a

Product of the ghetto 
Been blessed fo' sho 
To eat from out the ghetto 
I maneuver in the right lane 
Quick to push back lanes 
Switch it to the left lane 
I play with my hands 
And I'm plotting on the fortune 
It's gettin hot and scorching 
I'm thinking like a scorpion 
That torturing an enemy 
[Chorus 2x]
In this life I lead

That I've been introduced to 
Money and hoes keep us closer to Lucifer (what's up Kurupt) 
Steady seducing us 
And I'm all for it 
It's the life for me 
And the law cant spoil it 
So you can call it what the fuck you want (right) 
But I'm a baller alcoholic with a sawn-off pump (nigga) 
My mamma ain't raise no punk 
And even dead Pac 
So when I jump off 
I breathe for Yak 
Been puttin in work 
So I walk with a bop 
And it safe at home 
So I sleep with a glock (no mistakes) 
Thug living

And now im in the rap game like the crack game

Can't pretend to see my friends are not my enemies
And even thug muthafuckas wanna have fun
Stuck it, buckin' my muthafuckin magnum

Yeah that type of shit (maybe it's the thug in me)
You know what time it is (maybe it's the thug in me)
[2Pac]
By age thirteen I was buckwild, good at my knuckle game
Made it through a tough childhood never be the same
Walked in my daddy's shoes
No time to be a peaceful man had to shatter fools
That's 'til I put my eyes on you
God damn, sweetheart you got some thighs on you
Now I can't wait to get you home, get you all alone
In my bedroom, baby can we bone, and get it on
Tell me lady how you like me
and if you want it harder baby, come and bite me
but do it lightly; cause that excites me to let it pop
And if you lick me right, I'll do it all night
Only got fucked by a drug dealer
Never felt the real passion of a thug nigga (haha)
Though I like the way you scream when you lovin me
I'm goin deep, it's the thug in me; so whatchu sayin girl?
[Chorus: K-Ci 
&
 JoJo]
A thug nigga like me, I need a thug lady like you
Got a lot of thug in me, that I wanna put in you
A thug nigga like me, I need a thug lady like you
Got a lot of thug in me, that I wanna give to you
['Pac repeats "Maybe it's the thug in me" at various points]
[2Pac]
Moan baby when we bone it's on
It's so strong niggaz in the next room'll cum
I got ya head swingin, tongue kissin as I hit it from the back
with the bed ringin (haha)
Give me space as I lick ya face, stick the place
Synchronize so I drive when they kick the bass
Love fuckin in tha mo'nin
I get ya wet and bust a sweat, then I'm gone
Left you on yo' own girl
Tell me what you feel like, blindfolded
I'm cold do it real nice - that's if it feel right
Maybe it's the thug in me
I pull ya hair while we fuckin in the chair, when ya lovin me
Up against the wall, you can have it all; just try
Bet my kiss, can get you high, don't pass by
Grab me by my nuts when I'm lovin you
Now open up and let me put the thug in you
[Chorus]
[2Pac]
Say baby what's your phone number?
Be warned, I'm like a storm with my own thunder, I make the room rumble
In and out long stroke, hold ya breath now
Close your eyes deep throat - did you like it?
Oooh I'm excited!
Cause it's a party in my bedroom, you're invited - c'mon now
Let me see ya shake your rump, tell me
how long will it take to cum, havin fun
Do it one on one and we can all get involved
First y'all do me, then I'll fuck y'all
When you call me the next day
to get sexed by a nigga in the best way
Yeah baby it's a price to pay, only play in the fast lane
When you a hustler, motherfuck a cash came
I gotcha goin wild, cause I'm lovin you
Drugged out with this motherfuckin thug in you
[Chorus - 2x]
[2Pac]
I don't wanna talk, I don't want no explanations
I don't got no motherfuckin explanations, y'knahmsayin?
It's the thug in me
Don't be askin why I'm pullin your hair
and why I fuck so motherfuckin thuggish
That thug passion, y'knahmean?
Bitch, no mercy
What you scared of?  Didn't you come over here to get fucked?
You ain't come over here for me to be

You came over here to get fucked
Shit, if I ain't fuck you thug style
Bitch you'd leave my house talkin bout, "Tupac can't serve me"
Won't have me crossed up in that bullshit, hahaha
Turn over!
Maybe it's the thug in me!

Thug N U Thug N Me (Remix) 
(feat. K-Ci 
&
 JoJo)
[2Pac]
Ay come on JoJo ('Pac.. hahaha)
Yeah that type of shit (maybe it's the thug in me)
You know what time it is (maybe it's the thug in me)
[2Pac]
By age thirteen I was buckwild, good at my knuckle game
Made it through a tough childhood never be the same
Walked in my daddy's shoes
No time to be a peaceful man had to shatter fools
That's 'til I put my eyes on you
God damn, sweetheart you got some thighs on you
Now I can't wait to get you home, get you all alone
In my bedroom, baby can we bone, and get it on
Tell me lady how you like me
and if you want it harder baby, come and bite me
but do it lightly; cause that excites me to let it pop
And if you lick me right, I'll do it all night
Only got fucked by a drug dealer
Never felt the real passion of a thug nigga (haha)
Though I like the way you scream when you lovin me
I'm goin deep, it's the thug in me; so whatchu sayin girl?
[Chorus: K-Ci 
&
 JoJo]
A thug nigga like me, I need a thug lady like you
I got a lot of thug in me, that I wanna put in you
A thug nigga like me, I need a thug lady like you
I got a lot of thug in me, that I wanna give to you girl
['Pac repeats "Maybe it's the thug in me" at various points]
[2Pac]
Moan baby when we bone it's on
It's so strong niggaz in the next room'll cum
I got ya head swingin, tongue kissin as I hit it from the back
with the bed ringin (haha)
Give me space as I lick ya face, stick the place
Synchronize so I drive when they kick the bass
Love fuckin in tha mo'nin
I get ya wet and bust a sweat, then I'm gone
Left you on yo' own girl
Tell me what you feel like, blindfolded
I'm cold do it real nice - that's if it feel right
Maybe it's the thug in me
I pull ya hair while we fuckin in the chair, when ya lovin me
Up against the wall, you can have it all; just try
Bet my kiss, can get you high, don't pass by
Grab me by my nuts when I'm lovin you
Now open up and let me put the thug in you
[Chorus]
[2Pac]
Say baby what's your phone number?
Be warned, I'm like a storm with my own thunder, I make the room rumble
In and out long stroke, hold ya breath now
Close your eyes deep throat - did you like it?
Oooh I'm excited!
Cause it's a party in my bedroom, you're invited - c'mon now
Let me see ya shake your rump, tell me
how long will it take to cum, havin fun
Do it one on one and we can all get involved
First y'all do me, then I'll fuck y'all
When you call me the next day
to get sexed by a nigga in the best way
Yeah baby it's a price to pay, only play in the fast lane
When you a hustler, motherfuck a cash came
I gotcha goin wild, cause I'm lovin you
Drugged out with this motherfuckin thug in you
[Chorus - 2x]
[2Pac]
I don't wanna talk, I don't want no explanations
I don't got no motherfuckin explanations, y'knahmsayin?
It's the thug in me
Don't be askin why I'm pullin your hair
and why I fuck so motherfuckin thuggish
That thug passion, y'knahmean?
Bitch, no mercy
What you scared of?  Didn't you come over here to get fucked?
You ain't come over here for me to be
strokin, and all that bullshit
You came over here to get fucked
Shit, if I ain't fuck you thug style
Bitch you'd leave my house talkin bout, "Tupac can't serve me"
Won't have me crossed up in that bullshit, hahaha
Turn over!  Maybe it's the thug in me! ..

trying to hustle in the snow

Traveling this road my poor soul
has been consolidated
with all this bullshit I done tolerated
How I made it

it's like my heart be gripped with the Passion
to be the fucking greatest
Load up and take shit
[Dramacydal]
Make this to some high dollar gangster shit
jack a stack till we got enought bank to split
[Verse Four: Storm]
Creep with me

Thug Passion got you tremblin'

and let that loc see smoke
feelin' tha strokes of tha nine squeeze tight and slow
[Chorus]
[Verse Five: 2Pac]
They say money don't make tha man
but damn i'm makin' money
observin' you muthafuckers
cause some of you bitches funny

sippin' on some Alazay and Cristal, meanwhile
buy me a drink
and get to winking at me
she smiles
a niggas full of passion
Satisfaction is everlastin'
How does it feel  ?

while i'm rubbin' on that ass
why you laughin' ?

full blown and furious
baby get a grip
when I be doin' this
It's so physical
my attraction
driven by alchol 
beware of my reaction

thugged out on Death Row
You better recognize
and picture what I said so
Now you can feel it
it's a potion for my niggas in motion
forever blastin'
bitches ain't ready for this Thug Passion

Thugs Get Lonely Too 
(feat. Nate Dogg)
[Verse 1: 2Pac]
See, it ain't easy bein' me
Life as a celebrity is less than heavily
I got these fakes and these back-stabbers chasin' me around
And it's always drama
Whevever I wanna get around
Mama told me
Long before I ever came up
Gotta be true, to watchya' do
And keep ya' game up
'Cause things change
And jealousy becomes a factor
Best friends at your wifes house tryin' to MACK HER!
I'm on tour
But still they keep on knockin' at my door
And I got no time to worry
I'm steady wantin' more
Every day is a test, yes
I try hard
But I'm strugg-a-lin' with every breath
I pray to God that the woman that I left at home
All alone
Ain't nothin' like tryin' to bone
Over the phone
In my mind
I can see her naked
I can't take it
Got me shakin' at the thought that we can make it
I thought you knew.
[Chorus (x1): Nate Dogg]
I'm rolling out on tour today you getting sad because I'm goin away (Naaaa)
Chickenheads wanna play with me you getting mad because you think I'ma sway,
Some of them cute some of them fine as fuck I hear them scream as soon as I hit the stage
(Naaaa)
Still I be getting lonely for you I'm coming home as soon as I make this pay (Make this pay)
[Verse 2: 2Pac]
I call you up long distance
On the telephone
I wanna tuck you in
Even though I know I can't make it home
I whisper things in ya' ear
Like youre near me
Wonder if you feel me
From far away
Or can you hear me
It seems to me
That ya' jealous
'Cause I'm hustlin' and makin' money
With the fellas'
In the back streets
Tryin' to trap me
Baby HOLD UP
Thugs get lonely too!
But I'm a soulja
And theres no way I'mma' stop makin' money
'Cause ya' attitudes changed
And ya' actin' a little funny
Always complainin'
Sayin' we don't spend time
Can't you see
I got enough stress on my mind
And hangin' up like you all that
And get mad when I'm tell you that
"I'm busy baby, call back,"
Please, ain't nothin' left to say to you
Thugs get lonely too
You KNOW.
[Chorus (x1): Nate Dogg]
I'm rolling out on tour today you getting sad because I'm goin away (Naaaa)
Chickenheads wanna play with me you getting mad because you think I'ma sway,
Some of them cute some of them fine as fuck I hear them scream as soon as I hit the stage
(Naaaa)
Still I be getting lonely for you I'm coming home as soon as I make this pay (Make this pay)
[Verse 3: 2Pac]
I sit alone in my room, drinkin'
Without a care
Talkin out loud to ya'
Like ya' there
Take ya' picture out my back pocket
Man it's on
You the first face I wanna see
When I get home
I wanna love you 'till the sun rise
Buckwild
Touchin' every wall in the house
Thug style
Put ya' hands on the headboard
Think of me
Drippin' sweat on top of you
Sick of scenes in yo' head
That I'm makin' love
So turn the lights down
Reminice 'n relax
'Cause baby right now
I feel in the middle of my stomach
You whisper in my ear
Baby tell me how you really want it
Hold on tightly
Watch the ceiling
Scratch my back
How you react
Lets me know you feel me
'Cause everything I'm giving to you
Is so true
Thugs get lonely too
You know.
[Chorus (x1): Nate Dogg]
I'm rolling out on tour today you getting sad because I'm goin away (Naaaa)
Chickenheads wanna play with me you getting mad because you think I'ma sway,
Some of them cute some of them fine as fuck I hear them scream as soon as I hit the stage

We taking this one to the whole 'nother level gutter style Thug style
You feel me, things that we can only do as a real G
We ain't dead yet, feel me!!
[Verse 1]
I got my Hennessy find ya foes 
in a room full of niggas tryin' to hide ya hoes
I'm getting high off buddha
'Cause the times be slow
I keep my mind on dough
you never find me broke
and who meee a nigga livin' life like a G
in that artillery keepin' niggas off of me
I can't sleep living in these wicked times

You can holler if you want to pleeease
I ain't runnin' with no punk crew beeee

You suckas better find ya mind I got mine
from hustling and busting them rhymes

Down on Riker's Isle stay rile
But a nigga gotta use his styles
These,
[Chorus]
Niggas don't know my style
quick to smile juvenile
Was a problem child
try to put me in the courts
But my force was wild
Bitchmade ass niggas don't know my style
These,
Niggas don't know my style
quick to smile juvenile
Was a problem child
try to put me in the courts
But my force was wild
Bitchmade ass niggas don't know my style
[Verse 2]
I could be wrong but I never got along with cops
it's like they stuck
from making niggas duck from Glocks all the time
my mind's full of thoughts of ends
I'm still rolling my bucket but I bought me a Benz (tadow)
My fake friends say they love me but I know they lie
cause in the dark see they hearts' full of homicide
My mama cried when they took me off to jail
only me inside the cell
Straight locked up in this hell
I hear some sucka screaming like the demon's inside
will 'em away in the morning
Only the strong survive
I cry but in my own way
Swallow my pride pick a reason to hide
from all the niggas that die (Rest in Peace)
cemetary full of brothers I buried
It's going down even now I wonder
will I still be around my hometown is the gutter
I was born a wild came up out this dust
with my heartless style
These,
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
I remember Uptown huh got to get to listenin'
to Mr. Magic cuttin' up the hits
and even though I had habit makin' words rhyme
I was caught up in the madness
Juvenile thugs come on
I tell the whole story nothin' but truth
Halloween throwin' eggs from the project roofs
and Pete and Lee young G's
with a gift of gab and tryin' to hook up with the hookers
who was quick to stab remember mama's cooking
No school straight hookin'
and tryin' to get with light skinned
cause she good looking
And jumpin' over turnstiles 'cause we ain't paying
call the cuties cuss words but we only playing (biotch)
I'm prayin' I can get a buck no luck
I had to move around a lot
'cause my moms was stuck
I had family but I was way too wild
had to move to the West to regain my style
These,

Thugz Mansion 
(feat. Anthony Hamilton)
Shit, tired of gettin shot at
Tired of gettin chased by the police and arrested
Niggaz need a spot where WE can kick it
A spot where WE belong, that's just for us
Niggaz ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Y'knahmean?  Where do niggaz go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G
... at thug mansion
[Verse One]
A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide, and woulda tried
But when I held that 9, all I could see was my momma's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We found a family spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places, that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go in fast
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion
[Chorus: Anthony Hamilton]
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out paradise
In the skyyyyyyyyyy..
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed out mansion in paradise
In the skyyyyyyyyyy..
[Verse Two]
Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?
Trouble sparks, they tell me home is where the heart is, dear departed
I shed tattooed tears and couldn't sleep good
for multiple years, witness peers catch gunshots
Nobody cares, seen the politicians ban us
They'd rather see us locked in chains, please explain
why they can't stand us, is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head
with the little bit of homeboys that remains, cause all the rest dead
Is there a spot for us to roll, if you find it
I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful?  I'm comin from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream peace while the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love when I need to escape
the deadly places slingin drugs, in thug's mansion
[Chorus w/ minor ad lib variations]
[Verse Three]
Dear momma don't cry, your baby boy's doin good
Tell the homies I'm in heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drippin peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday
Sang sittin there kickin it with Malcolm, 'til the day came
Little LaTasha sho' grown
Tell the lady in the liquorstore that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cuttin lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
that passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin
Remember this face, save me a place, in thug's mansion

Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright (I wanna go)
Nothin but peace (I wanna go) love (I wanna go nigga)
And street passion, every ghetto needs a thug mansion
[Verse Two: Nas]
A place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide
Not to start beef but spark trees, no cops rollin by
No policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets
No reason, for nobody's momma to cry
See I'm a good guy, I'm tryin to stick around for my daughter
But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her
This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me
Only difference from me and Ossie Davis, gray hair maybe
Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin
I'm just twenty-some-odd years, I done lost my mother
And I cried tears of joy, I know she smiles on her boy
I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur
Cause like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war
And just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more
Cause one day we'll all be together, sippin heavnly champagne
where angels soar, with golden wings in thug's mansion
[Chorus w/o Nas]
[Verse Three: 2Pac]
Dear momma don't cry, your baby boy's doin good
Tell the homies I'm in heaven and they ain't got hoods

[Intro: Makaveli]
No doubt... to live and die in LA
California -- what you say about Los Angeles
Still the only place for me that never rains in the sun
and everybody got love
[Verse One: Makaveli]
To live and die in LA, where everyday we try to fatten our pockets
Us niggaz hustle for the cash so it's hard to knock it
Everybody got they own thang, currency chasing
Worldwide through the hard times, warrior faces
Shed tears as we bury niggaz close to heart
What was a friend now a ghost in the dark, cold hearted bout it
Nigga got smoked by a fiend, trying to floss on him
Blind to a broken man's dream, a hard lesson
Court cases keep me guessing, plea bargain
ain't an option now, so I'm stressing, cost me more
to be free than a life in the pen
Making money off of cuss words, writing again
Learn how to think ahead, so I fight with my pen
Late night down Sunset liking the scene
What's the worst they could do to a nigga got me lost in hell
To live and die in LA on bail, my angel sing
[Chorus: Val Young]
To live and die in LA, it's the place to be
You've got to be there to know it, what everybody wanna see
[repeat 2X]
[Verse Two: Makaveli]
It's the, City of Angels and constant danger
South Central LA, can't get no stranger
Full of drama like a soap opera, on the curb
Watching the ghetto bird helicopters, I observe
So many niggaz getting three strikes, tossed in jail
I swear the pen the right across from hell, I can't cry
Cause it's on now, I'm just a nigga on his own now
Living life Thug style, so I can't smile
Writing to my peoples when they ask for pictures
Thinking Cali just fun and bitches, hahaha
Better learn about the dress code, B's and C's
All them other niggaz copycats, these is G's
I love Cali like I love woman
Cause every nigga in LA got a little bit of Thug in him
We might fight among each other, but I promise you this
We'll burn this bitch down, get us pissed
To live and die in LA
(Let my angel sing)
[Chorus]
[Verse Three: Makaveli]
Cause would it be LA without Mexicans?
Black love brown pride and the sets again
Pete Wilson trying to see us all broke, I'm on some bullshit
Out for everything they owe, remember K-DAY
Weekends, Crenshaw -- MLK
Automatics rang free, niggaz lost they way
Gang signs being showed, nigga love your hood
But recognize and it's all good, where the weed at?
Niggaz getting shermed out
Snoop Dogg in this muhfucka perved out, M.O.B.
Big Suge in the Low-Low, bounce and turn
Dogg Pound in the Lex, wit a ounce to burn
Got them Watts niggaz with me, OFTB
They got some hash took the stash left the rest for me
Neckbone, Tre, Head Ron, Punchy too
Big Rock got knocked, but this one's for you
I hit the studio and drop a jewel, hoping it pay
Getting high watching time fly, to live and die in LA
(Let my angel sing)
[Chorus]
[Outro: Makaveli]
This go out for 92.3, and 106
All the radio stations that be bumping my shit
Making my shit sells katruple quitraple platinum, hehe
This go out to all the magazines that supported me
All the real motherfuckers
All the stores, the mom and pop spots
A
 people, all y'all motherfuckers
LA, California Love part motherfucking Two
Without gay ass Dre

Me and you movin in the nude, do it in the living room
Sweatin up the sheets, it's the Thug in me
I mean no disrespectin when I tongue kiss your neck
I go a long way to get you wet, what you expect
Late night, hit the highway, drop the top
I pull over, gettin busy in the parking lot
And don't you love it how I lick your, hips and glide
Kiss you soft on your stomach, push my love inside
Got ya lost in a love zone, stuck in the lust
I got the bedroom shakin back-breakin when we're tossin it up
[K-Ci, JoJo]
In this baby, I like the way it's goin down
When all that is around, slip slide ride
Givin me love nice like
Female I like, what I wanna give all night
You and me alone everybody's gone toss it up
Baby let's, get it on!
I like the way you please me, babe
The sexy way you tease me, sugar
The way you move your body
It really drives me crazy
Your body hypnotizing, your smell is so exciting
So baby come on home with me, I like the way you give it to me!
[Chorus: K-Ci, JoJo]
I like the way you give it to me -- let me see you toss it up
[repeat 4X w/ variations]
Play on, play on, play on, play on, play onnnn!
[repeat 4X w/ variations]
[K-Ci, JoJo]
Ohhh, it's K-Ci baby, mmm that want you lady
Ohhh, don't act so shady, baby your taste as fine as gravy
The way you move that thang, you make me wanna sang
Girl you make my bells rang, make them go ting-a-ling!
Now the man, I'm here again
Don't worry to ever end
It's feeling too good
Gimme some more, oh lady lady
Your body the kind I like-ah
Big booty to the lung delight-ah
Bag it up yo, let me in there
Toss it up for me!!
[Chorus 1/2]
[Tupac]
Do you want me what's your phone number, I get around
Cali Love to my true Thugs, picture me now
Still down for that Death Row sound, searchin for paydays
No longer Dre Day, arrivederci
Blown and forgotten, rotten for plottin Child's Play
Check your sexuality, as fruity as this Alize
Quick to jump ship, punk trick, what a dumb move
Cross Death Row, now who you gon' run to?
Lookin for suckers cause you similar
Pretendin to be hard, oh my God, check your temperature
Screamin Compton, but you can't return, you ain't heard
Brothers pissed cause you switched and escaped to the burbs
Mob on to this new era, cause we Untouchable
Still can't believe that you got 'Pac rushin you
Up in you, bless the real, all the rest get killed
Who can you trust, only time reveals -- toss it up!
[Chorus w/ variations]
[Tupac]
Play on playa, play on
How can some non-players do a song about Compton
and then wanna do a player song?
How can non-players do it?  (We not little kids, we not playin)
Tellin lies, who?
Puffy, I read your little interview buddy, c'mon
You still ain't touchin us, all that peace talk
I don't care if you kiss my ass from here to across the street boy
It's on
Toss it up, we took you on, and we took y'all beat
You know we beat you down, and we took y'all beat
Cause you wasn't rockin it right
Tired of suckers rockin it, toss it up, is how we did it
Yeah, toss it up now!

Tradin War Stories 
(feat. C-Bo, Dramacydal, Storm)
[2Pac]
A military mind nigga
A military mind mean money
A criminal grind nigga
A criminal grind mean hustle
You know
[Chorus: 2Pac (repeat 2X)]
We tradin war stories, we Outlawz on the rise
Jealous niggaz I despise, look in my eyes
[2Pac]
Now can your mind picture, a thug nigga drinkin hard liquor
This ghetto life has got me catchin up to God quicker
Who would figure that all I need was a hair trigger
semi-automatic Mack 11 just to scare niggaz
Pardon my thug poetry, but suckers is born everyday 
and fear of man - grow on trees
Criminal ties for centuries, a legend in my own rhymes
So niggaz whisper when they mention 
Machiavelli was my tutor Donald Goines, my father figure
Moms sent me to go play with the drug dealers
Hits fall, we thug niggaz and we came in packs.
Every one of niggaz strapped sippin on 'nac (Cognac)
In the back, my AR-15
Thuggin till I die, these streets got me cravin thorazine
My lyrics are blueprints to money makin
Fat as that ass that honey shakin
[Chorus (w/ Outlawz)]
[Fatal]
I bust a trey-trey, buggin an' shit
They call it overthuggin and shit
But I was just a younger nigga;
gettin older and lovin this shit
But what was I doin in this place?
To the fakes without a pistol in the first,
facin termination in the worst
But I figured to play the wall; to watch all these 
playa hatin niggaz position for I could see 'em all
Made it up out of there, lucky to be here to tell you
But it'll never be a repeat people I'm tryin to tell you.
[Dramacydal]
Now picture the scenery, I'm thugged out smokin greenery
Considered a B.G., but I'm off in this game somethin D-P
My eyes only see deez, that's why I'm young and burnt out
Learned the know how, well how to do now, by 18 turned out
And why I do it - the ridin and smokin
Collidin with foes - in the worst place; 
y'all shouldn'ta fucked with us ,in the first place
Y'all real O.G.'s, droppin game to the youngsters
Y'all don't want no funk cause
y'all be the next in the long line of war stories
[Chorus]
[C-Bo]
I breaks 'em off with this gangsta war story tale
Stackin loot up in the coupe that I protect with a Mack 12
Slap my clip in the chamber; fool, your life's in danger
No one will remain when I come through dumpin insane
Call me Bo-wl of Major Pain, gun-slang and movin 'caine
I be the nigga that's pullin the trigga
and dumpin the hollow points in your brain
Mo' bigger balls that RuPaul, Thug Life ain't a ball
We bust that ass up against the wall (up against the wall)
(?) Never been no (?) men
How we bucks 'em down on the way to the ground
ain't nuttin but the hog in me
Bust off his dildo, killin (?) and keep mobbin G
It ain't no problem (?) funk off
(?) blow down punks with my sawed off
Bust they dirty-ass drawers off
and had them bitch niggaz hauled off
[Chorus]
[Outlawz]
My whole family been raised, on shit that ain't okay
Ain't nuttin on this earth will make a nigga like me stay
I'm reminiscin, and catchin flashbacks when niggas ran up 
in my house and I was too young, to try to blast back
What happend then?  No one would tell me since I was three
Heard they got to my peoples, now they livin somewhere free
But fuck that, you got what's mines and I want that
Never drop my guard, been on the squad, since ways back
And now I'm sittin, holdin in anger because my parents missin
Thuggin Immortal, got some war stories for ya
[Storm]
Now look at me - straight Outlaw Immortal
Never gave a fuck cause I was nobody's daughter
Outlawin from my tits to my clits, don't try to figure 
cause the murderous tendencies of my mind can't be controlled, nigga
So who's the bigger, who's the quickest killer?
Would ya try to trip with my finger on the 9 milla
When I got cha on kay-nine-fourths
Prayin to God as your life goes back and forth
We tradin war stories
[Chorus (repeats through to end, getting softer)]
['Pac talking]
War stories nigga; hahaha, what players do
Thug Life, Outlaw Immortalz
Motherfuckin Tupac a.k.a. Makaveli
Can you feel me?  Just so you know, it's on Death Row
My niggaz love that shit
Dramacydal in this motherfucker, heheheh
Yea nigga!  Shout out to my niggaz Fatal and Felony
C-Bo, the bald head nut, what?
You know what time it is

Trapped 
You know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion
Happiness, living on tha streets is a delusion
Even a smooth criminal one day must get caught
Shot up or shot down with tha bullet that he bought
Nine millimeter kickin' thinking about what tha streets do
to me
Cause they never talk peace in tha black community
All we know is violence, do tha job in silence
Walk tha city streets like a rat pack of tyrants
Too many brothers daily heading for tha big penn
Niggas commin' out worse offthan when they went in
Over tha years I done alot of growin' up
Getten drunk thrown' up
Cuffed up
Then I said I had enough
There must be another route, way out
To money and fame, I changed my name
And played a different game
Tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle
If one more cop harrasses me I just might go psycho
And when I gettem
I'll hittem with tha bum rush
Only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed
Yo, if your smart you'll really let me go 'G'
But keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch tha uzi
They got me trapped....
[Chorus]
(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
They got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
They got me trapped
Can barely walk tha city streets
Without a cop harrassing me, searching me
Then asking my identity
Hands up, throw me up against tha wall
Didn't do a thing at all
I'm tellen you one day these suckers gotta fall
Cuffed up throw me on tha concrete
Coppers try to kill me
But they didn't know this was tha wrong street
Bang bang, down another casualty
But it's a cop who's shot there's brutality
Who do you blame?
It's a shame because tha mans slain
He got caught in tha chains of his own game
How can I feel guilty after all tha things they did to me
Sweated me, hunted me
Trapped in my own community
One day i'm gonna bust
Blow up on this society
Why did ya lie to me ?
I couldn't find a trace of equality
Work me like a slave while they laid back
Homie don't play that
It's time I lett'em suffer tha payback
I'm tryin to avoid physical contact
I can't hold back, it's time to attack jack
They got me trapped
[Chorus]
(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
You know they got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
(uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
You know they got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
Now i'm trapped and want to find a getaway
All I need is a 'G' and somewhere safe to stay
Can't use tha phone 
Cause i'm sure someone is tappin in
Did it before
Ain't scared to use my gat again
I look back at hindsite the fight was irrelevant
But now he's tha devils friend
Too late to be tellin' him
He shot first and i'll be damned if I run away
Homie is done away I should of put my gun away
I wasn't thinkin' all I heard was tha ridicule
Girlies was laughin', Tup sayin "Damn homies is dissin you"
I fired my weapon
Started steppin' in tha hurricane
I got shot so I dropped
Feelin' a burst of pain
Got to my feet
Couldn't see nothin' but bloody blood
Now i'm a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer
Ran through an alley
Still lookin' for my getaway
Coppers said Freeze, or you'll be dead today
Trapped in a corner
Dark and I couldn't see tha light
Thoughts in my mind was tha nine and a better life
What do I do ?
Live my life in a prison cell
I'd rather die than be trapped in a living hell
They got me trapped
[Chorus]
(Uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
They got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped
(uh uh, they can't keep tha black man down)
You know they got me trapped
(Naw, they can't keep tha black man down)
Trapped

Troublesome '96 
Troublesome nigga
[Chorus plays in background]
Troublesome 19-muthafuckin-96 (westside)
Let it be known nigga
Boss of all bosses, Makaveli
Menacin' methods label me a lethal weapon
Making niggas die witnessin' breathless imperfections
Can you picture my specific plan
To be the man in this wicked land,underhanded hits are planned
Scams are plotted over grams and rocks
[song version 1:]
 Undercover agents die by the random shots
[song version 2:]
 Outlaws motherfuckers die by the random shots
We all die in the end, so revenge we swore
I was all about my ends, fuck friends and foes
Me, a born leader, never leave the block without my my heata
Got me a dog and named her my bitch nigga eata
What could they do to me that little brat
Shit them niggas shot me and still terrified, I'll get their ass
How can I show you how I feel inside
We outlawz motherfuckas can't kill my pride
Niggas talk a lot of shit but that's after I'm gone
Cause they fear me in physical form let it be known
I'm troublesome
[Chorus]
Tra la la la la la all ya niggas die 
[several times]
Trouble shit
Gutter ways my mentality is ghetto
We're guerrillas in this criminal war, we all rebels
Death before dishonor bet on bomb on them first niggas do
We came for murder, pullin' up in a herse
Westside was the war cry bustin' all freely screaming fuck
All ya'll niggas in Swahili
Pistol packin' fresh out of jail, I ain't goin' back
Release me to care of my heartless strap
Say my name three times like Candyman
Bet I roll on your ass like an avalance
A soul survivor, learned to get high and pull drive bys
Murder my foes, can't control my nine
Hearin' thoughts of my enemies pleadin' please
Busta ass motherfuckas tried to flee
Picture me letting this chump survive
Redin' up on his ass when I'm doped and died
Cause I'm troublesome
[Chorus]
Murder murder my mind states shit ain't change since my last rhyme
The crime rate ain't decline
Niggas bustin' shots like they lost their mind
Like twenty-five to life never crossed their mind
Tell me young nigga never learned a thang
Dead at thirteen cause he yearned to bang
Sniffed a lot of flowers, but how can I cry
Try to warn the little nigga either stop or die
Mercy is for the weak when I speak I scream
Afraid to sleep in havin' of crazy dreams
Vivid pictures of my enemies and family times
God to forgive me cause it's wrong but I plan to die
Need to take me in heaven and understand I was a sheep
Did the best I could, raised in insanity
Or send me to hell cause I ain't beggin' for my life
Ain't nothing worse than this cursed ass hopeless life
Cause I'm troublesome

U Can Be Touched 
[Napoleon Talking]
Life...
What the f**k is life for ni**az like us?
Been waking up to another muthaf**kin' day
I'm the type of soldier, 
A ni**a that seen 
Everything in my muthaf**kin eyes
I seen my parents get killed 
To my muthaf**kin eyes
I seen my brother kill his-self in my eyes
I seen Pac.. Yak.. die in the struggle in my eyes
So I know anybody can be touched
You know what I mean?
[Napoleon]
Oh God forgive me
Somebody please say a prayer for me
Needed my parents
But they was never there for me
Believe in everything they feed me 
I'm seeing demons
I wake up screaming
Who believe me or was I dreaming?
Five fingers on the .45 chrome
Dead aim at my brain, infared with no lights on
I ain't afraid to die, I want to see what's after this
I'm living blind writing rhymes 
Til they capture this
And if we die let the world understand why
Soldier my eyes hate to see a young thug cry
They seeing us inside a casket
That's how they see us
Oh God forgive us ghetto bastards 
We human beings
They leaving us inside this hell-hole
Just waiting to fail so they tell us 
That's what jail for
Adolescense young teens turned violent
It's floating, in a world turned silent
Cause you could be touched
[Chorus Makaveli]
Young ni**az in the wild life
Criminal mind of a juvenile still live a child life
Thinking he can make his pay
Too in a rush, ni**az better slow down
Cause you can be touched
Young ni**az in the wild life
Criminal mind of a juvenile still live a child life
Thinking he can make his pay
Too in a rush, ni**az better slow down
Cause you can be touched
[E.D.I]
I live life High Speed 
Moving a million miles per hour
Towards my destiny
Making decesions carelessly
Yeah it's me, yo ni**a man child
Bomb first stand proud
Ain't looking for hand-outs
Twenty-five years up in this bi**h
And I'll be damned if I ain't leaving rich
And leave my kids a grip
I let my blood drip off in this thug s**t
You can be touched, I catch you slippin' while I'm on a money mission
Like right now, 30 dollars to my John Hancock
Try to get mo' so my s**t don't flock
I lick off shots for everything they owe me
And when it's my time to go
I pray the Lord hold me
(U can be touched)
[Kastro]
I was born in the city that never sleeps
Schooled by the realest of the real ni**az 
That ever breathed
And I was big when I was young
And now I see that I was dumb
My ni**a.. Lonnie just got hit with 10... 10 years
For trusting a friend
They left him stuck in the Penn
I love him, we all here just to die here, plus
Nobody cares what got here
Touched by a angel and kissed by the Lord
Praise the thug ways and I'll never be bored
Touched by a angel and kissed by the Lord
Y'all praise the thug ways 
So forever it's on.. baby
[Chorus Makaveli]
My Young ni**az in the wild life
Criminal mind of a juvenile still live a child life
Thinking he can make his pay
Too in a rush, ni**az better slow down
Cause you can be touched
Young ni**az in the wild life
Criminal mind of a juvenile still live a child life
Thinking he can make his pay
Too in a rush, ni**az better slow down
Cause you can be touched
[Young Noble]
Why grieve this life 
Planted by the fiends and pipes
Green lights so 
I'm seeing-seeing everything twice
Pretty much of nothing nice
(naw) we sucking it up
Even when we get a job, we f**king it up
Like it can't happen to us
I could never be a bum
Yeah right, you wound up one
God forbid I'm touched, y'all keep living it up
Look and learn
Next it could be your turn... word
[Kadafi]
Yes this a felonies' hobby 
That got me here thinking robbery
Day to day all year long 
Teflon protects my body
It's such unimportant in this criminal cartel
I'm caught and supporting me 
So in these streets of hockey
I play the goalie, 
Secretz to war licks, and score s**t
Share between clients and homies 
Remember what Patcino told me
Before he past
Watch them clowns with them crocodile smiles
Cause they phony, I get that cash, stay lonely
And I'm point like a thong 
And it's survive for the strong
Living outside the laws of this crooked world
I was born touched
[Chorus Makaveli]
My Young ni**az in the wild life
Criminal mind of a juvenile still live a child life
Thinking he can make his pay
Too in a rush, ni**az better slow down
Cause you can be touched
Young ni**az in the wild life
Criminal mind of a juvenile still live a child life
Thinking he can make his pay
Too in a rush, ni**az better slow down
Cause you can be touched

U Can Call 
(feat. Jazze Pha)
[Verse One: 2Pac]
Dear baby you the picture of perfection
Straight from your million dollar smile
to my attraction to your complexion
No hesitation needed; you got me
inhalin the aroma of your perfume, and feelin heated
I move closer to drop the lines of my introduction
Hold out my hand, and grab yo' hand, now we touchin
My lyrics are poetry
So baby get a ticket to go with me
Thugged out so you notice me
It's a positive attraction; see pictures of us
layin butt-naked on the beach kickin back relaxin
And only you can calm, the savage beast
Look in my eyes are you surprised, that it's me?
I wanna make you mine
I'm kissin on you tryin to make it different every time (that's right)
I'm so lonely in my bedroom, lookin at the walls
Withcha number in my hand, wonderin should I even call her tonight
[Chorus: Jazze Pha]
Anytime you like, baby you can call me
Need a thug up in yo' life, never find nobody like me
Cause I know what you want, and girl you know I got you
You got what I need, and shorty it's all on you
Baby call on me
[Verse Two: 2Pac]
Been gettin nuttin but bad news, ever since the day you left me
I sit and wonder is there a way, you could forget me
Remember my phone calls, my late visits
Us havin breakfast in bed, then we straight kick it
Me and you in satin sheets, 'til after two
Come take a walk on the wild side, enjoy the view
Whenever we collide; it's bound to be a pleasurable time
Makin love 'til the early light
Sweetheart don't fight the feelin
Come get a shot of this plain dealin and concentrate on the ceiling
It's my intention to brush up
Beware of the fireworks, cause everytime we touch..
.. it's bound to be, so relax, clown with me
As if you're down with me, get around and see
The brother with tattoos and no fears
Runnin my fingers through your hair if you call me
[Chorus]
[Verse Three: 2Pac]
Pardon me, but let's be specific
Baby cause if you down with me, nigga we can kick it
And let's take trips and ride airplanes
A hundred thousand dollar car on dem gold thangs, so can you hang?
Cause we can be real tight (right)
I got a big suite at the hot', if it feel right
My only wish is to be witcha
You got me steady strivin to getcha
Fantasizin of friendly pictures
The pressure's gettin major
I wonder will you answer my call, if I page ya
Got me goin wild with anticipation
Face to face with us locked up in strange places, what will it take
Cause the heartache be heatbreak, is my prediction
when you falsify and start fake, in my position
I'm a careful man, but a player when I ball
Got my eyes on you baby, can I call?
[Chorus - repeat 2X]

Get in the fuckin car.. get in the car
(Heh, say you, you scared to ride in my car
cause you, you think niggaz gon' be blastin at it
It ain't even that deep baby)
You don't have to worry you can ride with me now
Niggaz are quick to scream how they die for me now
Only got one click, we Outlawz on the Row
Fair exchange when we fuck them hoes
[2Pac]
Repetitive blows are thrown, to my foes
No love shown get disposed of blasted full blown
My unknown tendencies to mash my car
Getting wicked with my ski-mask, find the stash and dump
Why niggaz run I'm the last one standin the rest die
Victims of my lethal chrome cannon, Westside
Though it's worldwide no one can deny my views
Tracked it to my very fabric once the plastic blew
Five shots changed my whole life, throats were slit
Niggaz die by my orders when I wrote this shit
Though we go back like wild knights at Latin Quarters
Niggaz tried to kill me, and I fed they wife and they daughters
Blazed the weed, draped they seeds, gave 'em cash
Pass the fame and let the game go rollin past
Why you change, it's a cold world taught me life
Retaliation proves niggaz never caught me right
Say they shot me in my nuts, out of luck quick
Bullshit nigga cause I'm still fuckin yo' bitch
Niggaz got me twisted in a bad way, why you change?
Fuck with me, all this shit pay, nigga fuck the fame
[Young Noble]
Don't remember "Hit 'Em Up," don't make us do it once.. more
Yo' niggaz know, you ain't fucking with them Out..lawz
We keep souljas, souljas from Compton to Brooklyn
Your the type to get sniped, when the cops is lookin
Don't nobody give a fuck cause you done crossed the game
Lost in fame, and you should take, all the blame
You made yo' bed nigga lay in it
Scared to come up out that cell nigga stay in it
It's not a game only got one click we Outlawz from the do'
Dirt stains when I buck on the fo', you kissin the flo'
We dirty as the motherfuckin streetz of Jerz
We sweep niggaz with the words though the heat's preferred
Holla
[Chorus]
You don't have to worry you can ride with me now
Niggaz are quick to scream how they die for me now
Only got one click, they Outlawz on the Row
Fair exchange when we fuck these hoes, let the punks know
[Napoleon]
'Pac I wish I was in the motherfuckin car wit'cha
I'd have took every bullet that they threw, hand of God nigga
I only got one click, Outlawz 'til I'm gone
Heavy in the game and we coming for they fuckin throne
The love is gone well it is what it is
And plottin on us, they best be prayin for they kids, mayne
You don't have to worry cause I ride for ya
Like K said over loyal even tell bout a lie for ya
You put me in the game and dog I owe it all to ya
And when it get to poppin I'ma fuckin ball for ya
And everything I do gon' have your names on it
I'll never let them forget I put my seeds on it
[Kastro]
You gon' die before yo' time, come face the truth
In the middle of the desert nigga lace your boots
As a youth, hundred proof, tap my chest is a dead rest
You studio niggaz still remind your vest
Why the fuck you ain't done yet swallow yo' teeth
In the field you woulda been need a straw when you eat
Fuck a glock nine that shit is weak on the streets
And if you can't strategize then you just can't eat
If your life in another nigga hand, you deaded
And if it's beef and your man disappear then don't sweat it
Another fake nigga usin my strengths to get credit
I mean (?) face sound scared but your heartbeat said it
[Chorus]
[Young Noble]
I was born ugly, unlucky and dusty
But now I'm a rider, connivin gutsy
And I don't trust nobody, so don't nobody trust me
And that's how I'ma go about it 'til somebody bust me
I play for keeps like the OG's raised me
If I sleep I won't eat, who gonna feed my baby?
And I think I'm goin crazy cause my hair is gettin thiner
I've been drinkin on the daily, I can hardly remember
I got - bad nerves, paranoia destroyed me
I love the Lord but the church can't cure me
I sleep light, I wake peekin out my window
With guns under my mattress and guns under the pillow
And that's the way it's gonna be 'til they bury me
But don't twist it cause none of y'all niggaz worry me
[Outlawz]
What the fuck you didn't know?
Kizza-Kastro, Young Noble with the criminal flow
You nervous nelly ass niggas belly up in the river, no dizoubt
Y'all niggaz can't fade me with the clippers
We put it down, look around, 'til we find you we hound
Penitentiary bound, to remind you
[Kadafi]
Kadafi I bring the lingo to the click
Tasty like a Pringle, sneakin through your chimney like Kris Kringle
On some shit, get me free to let my ice click
Ka-pling, ka-plow, I been a thug shootin slugs since a child

Let the punks know

Unconditional Love 
(What y'all want?)
Unconditional Love (no doubt)
Talking bout the stuff that don't wear off 
It don't fade
It'll last for all these crazy days
These crazy nights
Whether you wrong or you right
I'm a still love you
Still feel you
Still there for you 
No matter what (hehe)
You will always be in my heart
With unconditional love
[Verse One:]
Come listen to my truest thoughts, my truest feelings
All my peers doing years beyond drug dealing
How many caskets can we witness
Before we see it's hard to live
This life without God, so we must ask forgiveness
Ask mama I got this urge to die
Witness the tears falling free from my eyes
Before she could reply
Though we were born without a silver spoon
My broken down TV, show cartoons in my living room (hey)
One day I hope to make it
A player in this game
Mama don't cry, long as we try
Maybe things change
Perhaps it's just a fantasy
A life where we don't need no welfare
Shit with our whole family
Maybe it's me that caused it
The fighting and the hurting
In my room crying cause I didn't want to be a burden
Watch mama open up her arms to hug me
And I ain't worried bout a damn thang, with unconditionl love
[Chorus: 2x]
In this game the lesson's in your eyes to see
Though things change, the future's still inside of me
We must remember that tomorrow comes after the dark
So you will always be in my heart, with unconditional love
[Verse Two:]
Just got the message you've been calling all week
Been out here hustling on these streets, ain't had a chance to speak
But you know, with you and me it's on G
We could never be enemies, cause you been such a good friend to me
Where would I be without my dogs
No wonder why when times get hard
Cause it ain't easy being who we are
Driven by my ambitions, desire higher positions
So I proceed to make Gs, eternally in my mission
Is to be more than just a rap musician
The elevation of today's generation 
If could make 'em listen
Prison ain't what we need, no longer stuck in greed
Time to play and strategize, my family's gotta eat 
When we make somethin out of nothing
No pleasure in the suffering, neighborhood would be good
If they could cut out all the busting
The liquor and the weed the cussing
Sending love out to my block 
The struggle never stops (unconditional love)
[Chorus]
[Verse Three:]
I'll probably never understand ya ways
With everyday I swear I hear ya
Trying to change your ways while gettin paid at the same time
Just had a baby with the same eyes
Something inside, please let me die these are strange times
How come I never made it
Maybe it's the way the played it in my heart
I knew one day I gotta be a star
My hopes and all my wishes
So many vivid pictures, and all the currency
I'll never even get to see
This fast life soon shatters
Cause after all the lights and screams
Nothing but my dreams matter
Hoping for better days
Maybe a peaceful night, baby don't cry
Cause everythang gonna be alright
Just lay your head on my shoulder
Don't worry bout a thang baby
Girl I'm a soldier (huh)
Never treated me bad, no matter who I was
You still came with that, unconditional love
[Chorus 3x until fade]

Until The End Of Time 
(feat. RL (Next))
[2Pac]
Perhaps I was addicted to tha dark side
Somewhere inside my childhoodi missedmy heart die
And even though we both came from the same places
The money and the fame made us all change places
How could it be through the misery that came to pass
The hard times make a true friend afraid to ask, for currency
But you could run to me when you need me, I'll never leave 
I just needed someone to believe in, as you can see 
It's a small thang through and true
What could I do? Real homies help ya get through,
And coming new, he'd do tha same thang if he could
Cuz in the hood true homies make you feel good
Andhalf the time we be acting up call tha cops
Bringing the cease to tha peace that was on my block
It never stop, when my mama ask me will I change
I tell her yeah, but it's clear I'll always be tha same
Until the end of time 
[Chorus: RL]
So take, these broken wings
I need your hands to come and heal me once again
(Until the end of time)
So I can fly away, until the end of time
Until the end of time
Until the end of time
[2Pac]
Please Lord forgive me for my life of sin
My hard stare seem to scare all my sister's kids
So you know I don't hang around tha house much
This all night money making got me outta touch, shit
Ain't flashed a smile in a long while
An unexpected birth worst of the ghetto childs
My attitude got me walking solo
Ride out alone in my low-low
Watching the whole world move in slow-mo
For quiet times disappear listen to the ocean
Smoking Ports think my thoughts 
Then it's back to coasting
Who can I trust in this cold world
My phony homey had a baby by my own girl
But I ain't trippin I'm a player I ain't sweating him
I sexed his sister, had her mo' good like a Mexican
His next of kin, No remorse it was meant to happen
Besides rapping the only thing I did good was scrapping
Until the end of time
[Chorus x2]
[2Pac]
Now who's to say if I was right or wrong?
To live my life as an outlaw all along
Remain strong in this planet full of playa haters
They conversate but Death Row full of demonstrators
And in tha end drinking henessy made all my enemies envy me
So cold when I flow eliminating easily
Fall to their knees, they plead for their right to breath
While beggin me to keep the peace (haha)
Well I can see close into achieve
In times of danger don't freeze time to be a g
Follow my lead I supply everything you need
An ounce of game and the trainin to make a g
Remember me, as an outcast outlaw
Another album out that's what I'm about, more
Gettin raw till the day I see my casket
Buried as a g while tha whole world remembers me
Until the end of time

After the pleasure there's pain 
Even though we broke for the moment we'll be balling again 
Time to make ya'll, my military be prepared for the busters similar to 
Bitches to scary, get to near me we rush 'em 
Visions of over packed prisons 
Million's of niggas thug living 
Pressure's, three strikes I hope they don't test us 
So pull the heat out, ammunition in crate's (shh) 
Move without a sound as we slide down pistols in place 
I'm sensing niggas is defenceless I'm hitting fence's then getting ghost 
Who can prevent me shooting senseless? 
At these niggas throats 
Bitch made niggas and that bullshit you going through 
Outlaws busting while we rushing 
We untouchable

Thinking I'm a ho, well, come and let me show ya 
I'm a light up the rhythm like dosia 
Dumping so potent, nigga don't choke up 
Flow up 
Makaveli The Don, got niggas strapped and ready to bomb 
As soon as I send the alarm, and when we're done 
We've committed a red rum, leaving the enemies dead and gone 
Leaving 'em niggas head's blown, cause they know they dead wrong 
When the shots ring out you know we're coming through (Know we're coming through) 
Talk a lot with your mouth, well what you gon' do? (So what you gon' do?) 
Shut 'em down, busters be knowing to keep they distance 
Thugs don't fuck around 
We get back at 'em so swiftly, niggas is with me underground 
Slug in a niggas mug, reppin' Midwest Side

Ride for Pac, Pac, get live for Pac, Pac, Pop off the Glock, Glock

Only wish to breed

Bury me in pieces cause they fear reincarnation 
Niggas screaming peace cause they fear when my squad face 'em 
Take them to places, stake they face then erase 'em and brake 'em 
Murder motherfucker's at a rate and then quicken the pace 
Blast me but never ask me to live a lie 
Am I wrong cause I wanna get it on till I die? 
(Westcoast) 
Now I'm worldwide 
Niggas gossip like girls then hide 
No offence to Nas but this whole fucking world is mine 
Even if you blind you can still see my prophecy 
My destiny to overthrow those on top of me 
Fiending for currency the money be calling 
Can you feel me, dreaming? 
Seeing scenes of me balling? 
Fuck you bitch made niggas and that bullshit you going through 
Outlaws busting while we rushing

Fuck you niggas and that bullshit you going through

Whatcha Gonna Do 
(Yawn) 
(hahaha) 
And ugh 
I started out dumb 
Sprung off a hood rat 
Listening to the radio 
Wishing that I could rap 
But nothing changed 
I was stuck in the game 
Cause everybody in the industry was fucking me man 
Listen 
I've got a scheme 
Break away do my own thing 
Drop some conversation 
Sit back and let the phone ring 
Niggas they wanna see me rise 
'97 watch me cut these motherfuckers down to size 
And if I catch another case 
Lord knows how they hate me 
Got a playa in the court room 
Please don't let them frame me 
I've been dealt a lot of bad cards 
Living as a thug 
Count my blessings 
Don't stress in this land with no love 
Maybe if they see me rolling 
Look at all this green I'm holding 
I guess that's why the envious 
Get their eye swollen 
Hoping the heavenly farther love a hustler 
Be the hardest nigga on earth to ever bust a nut 
My homies tell me have a heart 
Fuck they feelings 
I've been trying to make a million since we started 
We cold hearted 
Niggas in masks that'll blast at the task force 
Empty out my clip 
Time to mash 
They asked for it 
Me Makaveli I'm a motherfucker 
We break bread 
Now we thug brothers (huhuh) 
Niggas talk a lot of nonsense 
I choose to ignore 
A war 
They ain't ready for it (huhuh) 
[Chorus]
Now what cha gonna do? when my niggas come for you 
(What ya gonna do) 
Now what cha gonna do? when my niggas come for you 
(What ya gonna do) 
Now what cha gonna do? when my niggas come for you 
(What ya gonna do) 
Now what cha gonna do? when my niggas come for you

My nine is thuglord 
My mind on my grind 
Outlawz is my heart 
They shine when I shine 
My ryhme is my grind 
My team be on role 
Proceed with the onslaught 
Indeed they on top 
They all marks 
And its an outlaw holocaust 
When I got the sawed-off 
Niggas gettin' halved off 
Yer, nigga beware 
Stand clear 
This nigga's scared 
Man I don't really care 
I've been lost loved (loved) 
My heart need a hug (hug) 
My bite leave blood (blood) 
Fight with a grudge 
The life of a thug nigga, might need gloves 
But you will never know 
With a price on your mug 
And fight strips snug right around your hands 
Niggas sure you can never grab the mic again 
Dog you fucking with a grown man 
And I can't afford to loose 
Where we from niggas told to do 
So what cha ya wann' do? 
[Chorus]
Now what cha gonna do? when my niggas come for you 
(What ya gonna do) 
Now what cha gonna do? when my niggas come for you

Watch me clown 
Give me loving when I'm high 
I'ma outlaw baby I'll be thugging 'till I die 
In drop-top double r 
Life as a rap star 
Hustle like a crack fiend 
'Till they catch me 
Go ask somebody to your show 
Watch them niggas out the sight of mah night scope 
Cooking white dope 
Got mah nigga 25 to life stretched out 
Trying to have all the better things in life 
Well Makaveli 
A born leader 10 millimeter 
Changing niggas future like a schizophrenic palm reader 
Heeds from out the bible I read 
See the meek shall inherit the earth 
And the strong will lead 
Hittin' weed like it alright 
I'm in the studio 
Making music all night 
My enemies cry whenever I rise 
They hated 'till death 
Try to beat me out my last breath 
What cha gonna do?

[2Pac:]
Tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do 
Now what's next 
Tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do 
Now what's next 
Caught up in the middle 
My life's a riddle 
Don't let it get ya 
I wanna be legal 
But it's this hustle that get me richer 
One love to my peoples makin' money 
I can see you bubblin' 
Avoid all trouble 
Beware of devils continue strugglin' 
Nothin's impossible if there's a will there's a way 
So get your mind on official business 
You can be great 
And it's been this way from the cradle to the grave 
So get paid 
My niggaz do this every fuckin' day 
We parlay 
Through politics and conversation 
This information to my thug niggaz in the congregation 
Watch and bare witness to the pleasures of participation 
Separation is self destruction 
What's needed is unification 
Cause the world ain't hardly scared 
If not prepared 
Be sure to be bummy and be no longer there 
But no one cares it's there to share 
All we get is stares 
Because of fear we'll evaporate 
Say your prayers 
And what's next 
[Chorus x2:]
Hard livin' got me goin' insane 
But I'm addicted to the hustle I'm trapped in the game 
Whatz next 
I'm goin' crazy 
Tell me tell me what the fuck am I suppose to do 
Whatz next 
[A3:]
(Aye its on A3) 
Makaveli tried to warn us 
But niggaz ain't listen to Pac 
Naw (listen listen) nigga really listen to Pac 
Shit yean got it yet (no) 
Then you won't get it 
Might as well measure 'em up 
And have his ass fitted 
Why 
Caught slippin' dog trippin' didn't soak game 
Got his wig split like dem shutters on the airplane 
Never will change niggaz wit' no name no shame 
Might open ya head foe mess broke change 
I stay posted like a flag (flag) 
Starin' thru my rear view ballin' in a jag (jag) 
Bounce wit me Cali body rock down in H-Town 
We gon' put these artificial bustas in they place now 
Time foe a change 
Real niggaz rollin' wit' me 
Money makin' swift decision we controllin' the streets 
Side track by the broads and the frauds 
Ain't it strange 
It's the reason so many niggaz get scarred in the game 
Whatz next 
[Chorus x2]
[Jay Rock:]
That money gotta make it 
What I gotta do to make it 
Do I really gotta take it 
Put this mack up to you face it 
Doin' what we gotta do to survive 
Just ask Kweli doin' what we do to get by 
Some niggaz stick to the crime 
Pitchin' nickel and dimes 
What the fuck we s'pose to do 
Who gon' give us a job 
So I tried and tried 
Tried to get out the grind 
But the block kept on callin' me back 
Fiends kept on callin' for crack 
So I supply 'em wit' that 
Gave 'em a reasonable fee 
Nigga don't blame it on me 
Shit just look where I'm at 
Niggaz in gardens 
LAPD is the target 
Niggaz is heartless hustle regardless 
Look that dope spot use to be an apartment 
But now it's just a place to hide the guns in the closet 
Watch ya step shift the grams under the carpet 
We just tryin' hard not to see that coffin 
Whatz next

Why?  Do you want to fuck me?
Just cuz I'm paid in the worst way? True.
Lookin kind a good in your birthday suit.
I wonder if your wild and ya act shy.
Do you like to be on top or the back side?
Watch me while you lick your lips, shake your hips.
Goddamn, I love that shit.
Yo, let's stop fakin and be real now.
I got a room and a hard on. Still down?
Met ya standin at a bar full of black dudes.

When we head for my hideout, act right.
Boss playa when I ride out, that's right.
What'z ya phone number?
If you really wanna fuck with me, I'm ready.
Baby, let me give you a call.
How long will it take to break you off?
[Repeat once more]
Oh shit, baby is a dime piece.
Wanted this fine seat.

If I see ya right.
Now she can get me.
Hor didn't wanna talk to me till she see my car.
Never had sez with a rich rap star
Till I got her in the back of my homeboy's car.
Tell me, why do we live this way?
Money over bitches.
Let me here you say:
What'z your phone number?
Are you alone?
Got a pocket full of rubbers, let's bone.
Time for your girlfriend to take you home.
I had fun,
But baby, gotta leave me alone.
Picture in my rhyme.
Take time to rewind these ? words I say.
If you open your mind,
Bet in a minute you'll find it's time.
Let the Outlaws play.
What'z ya phone number.

When I Get Free II 
Ay Trusty Trusty, what you want man?
Aww nigga let me get one of them ciggarettes, damn!
Shit, come on bastard, get the phone for a nigga
Use the phone, aww nigga get the phone for me man
What's the number? 323-6545, tell her it's Pac
[Chorus: repeat 2X]
When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street
There'll be trouble when they see me
I heard a snicker a laugh, I take a look at the evening news
And see a nigga gettin cuffed by the boys in blue
Is it a, frame up, tryin to keep me out the game, stuck
These motherfuckers tryin to dirty up my name, but
I slip as quick as the wind, it's me again, fuck friends
My foes be on a mission, tryin to do me in
Fuck em I'm out to get out, they all thought
I blow up like gauge, and in a rage blow they balls off
Why are you niggaz tryin to test me trick?
And be the first ones to snitch to arrest me bitch
Maintain with a nigga meal ticket only if you with the real
The nigga will kick it, I'll enforce it with the steel
These are lessons that I learned in jail
Rule one: fuck a busta he can burn in Hell
Now I'm workin with connects that I got in the pen
In no time I'll be clockin again
[Chorus]
Heyyy, still sittin in my cell as I dwell on my past
Tryin to figure how a nigga turned dreams into cash
Quick call her collect, ain't no respect on the other side
My cellmate's suicidal cause his mother died
And my C.O. is a lady, and I'm thinkin maybe
me and her can hook up a scheme, to be Swayze
Cause she keep on callin me baby, to a young
motherfucker facin eighty that's enough to make me crazy
Now how long will it take, to get a hook
Got her watchin me liftin weights, sneakin looks
I devised a plan, I'm in the trunk while she drives
but man, ain't no disguise I'ma die as a man
If we make it then I'm takin it to Hell
all them niggaz that was frontin while I sat up in a cell
Locked in jail, I couldn't touch her so I planned, in misery
The nigga you don't wanna see
[Chorus 3X]
When I get free, believe that shit
Yeah nigga fuck your cigarette, fuck that phone call motherfucker
I'll be out this motherfucker in a few days
I'll pay these bitches back in spades
Punk ass bastards, long as my AK flexes
we gonna play these bitches
That's how we do this shit
Fuck that I'm out, C.O. turn the fuckin lights out!

 Damn.. what I'ma do now?  When I get free.. oh shit!

 Get free.. yeah yeah

When I get free, motherfuckers better watch they ass
Soon as I get released, I'ma clock some cash
Did some time locked down, but I'm back on the street

Them bitches is foul, take a look at the evening news
You'll see a nigga gettin cuffed by the boys in blue

These motherfuckers tryin to dirty up my name, but
I'm slippin quick as the wind, it's me or them
Fuck friends my foes be on a mission tryin to do me in
Fuck 'em I'm bout to get out, they all soft
I blow up like gauge, and in a rage blow they balls off
Why are you niggaz tryin to test me trick?
And be the first ones to snitch to arrest me bitch
Main thang was to make a nigga meal ticket
Only if you with the real, the nigga will kick it
I'll enforce it with the steel use the lessons that I learned in jail
Rule one: fuck a busta he can burn in Hell
Network with connects that I got in the pen
In no time I'll be clockin again

Still sittin in my cell as I dwell on my past

[Chorus + J. Valentine's harmonizing]
[2Pac]
Stuck in my cell
The pen ain't nuttin like the county jail
When will they let me bail?
Walkin through the yard, I play the God
First nigga disrespect me first nigga gettin scarred
I'm, back on the scene
I'm hittin knees in the back of a limousine, puffin on weed
as we game on the drunk hoes
Hit the skunk I reminisce just on the way
we used to play, you punk hoes
What I posess is to be rich, in currency
Paranoid niggaz like bitches when they come and see me
Laid out, played out, the nigga barely breathin
As for that bullshit punk, nigga n-now we even
But I wait, until it's time
and try to find a crooked way to profit off this crime
This life of mine.. until I get free
My prophecy is niggaz screamin, as if they bleed in agony
As soon as they popped my gate
I knew these motherfuckers made a mistake
[Chorus + J. Valentine's harmonizing]
[Chorus - 1/2]

Hahaha.. yeah nigga, when I get motherfuckin free
Pop the gate, I'm back baby!

When Thugz Cry 
When thugs cry..
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my guns to keep
If I die before I wake
I pray the Lord my soul to take
God as my witness, when thugs cry, too much is hard
[2Pac]
Born thuggin and lovin the way I came up
Big money clutchin, bustin while evadin cocaine busts
My pulse rushin, send my pulse into insanity
Shout at my cousin now we bustin if they yo' family
The coppers wanna see me buried, I ain't worried
I got a line on the D.A. cause I'm fuckin his secretary
I black out and start cussin, bust 'em and touch 'em all
They panic and bitches duckin, I rush 'em and fuck 'em all
I'll probably be an old man before I understand
why I had to live my life with pistols close at hand
Kidnapped my homey's sister, cut her face up bad
They even raped so we blazed they pad
Automatic shots rang out, on every block
They puttin hits out on politicians, even cops, I ain't lyin
They got me sleepin with my infrared beams
And in my dreams I hear motherfuckers screamin
What is the meaning, when thugs cry?
[Chorus: singers]
Oh why, children send your child off to die
In the streets of chalk where they lie
Let no wrongs cry out when thugs cry
Dear God..
Oh why, does it have to be this way, our
children of today won't stay wise
Let the children hear when thugs cry
Dear God.. oh why..
[("When thugs cry") on line 4, first time only]
[("thugs cry") on line 6, first time only]
[2Pac]
Heh.. maybe my addiction to friction got me buggin
Where is the love?  Never quit my ambition to thug
Ain't shed a tear since the old school years of elementary
Niggaz I used to love, enclosed in penitentiaries
But still homey keep it real, how does it feel
to lose your life, over somethin that you did as a kid?
You all alone, no communication, block on the phone
Don't get along with yo' pop, and plus your moms is gone
Where did we go wrong?  I put my soul in the song
to help us grow at times, but now our minds are gone
We went from brothers and sisters, to niggaz and bitches
We went from welfare livin, to worldwide riches
But somethin changed in this dirty game, everything's strange
Lost all my homies over cocaine.. mayne
See they ask me if I shed a tear, I ain't lie
See you gotta get high or die, cause even thugs cry
[Chorus]
[2Pac]
And all I see is these paranoid bitches, illegal adventures
Bustin motherfuckers with uppercuts, I leave 'em with dentures
Cause in my criminal mind, nobody violates the Don
I write your name on a piece of paper, now your family's gone
Why perpetrate like you can handle my team?
So merciless that my attack'll take command of your dreams
Leavin motherfuckers drownin in they own blood
Clownin takin pictures later
Laugh bout the punk bitches, that turned snitches
Regulate my area, the terror I represent
Makin yo' people disappear, you wonderin where they went?
Am I cold or is it just I sold my soul?
Addicted to these streets, never find true peace I'm told
Come take my body God, don't let me suffer any longer
Smoke a pound of marijuana, so I know it ain't long
Where is the end to all my misery, is there a close?
I suppose that's why I murder my foes, when thugs cry
[Chorus]
[2Pac over Chorus]
I shed tattooed tears for years
for my dead homeboys and my prison peers
Y'all ain't never heard my cries
Now you wonder why would you die?

When We Ride 
(feat. Outlawz)
[Outlaw Immortalz]
Bow down to somethin greater than yourself trick
Individuals capable of enormous amounts of chin checks and eye swolls
They know
You watchin but you ain't seein what lies before you, beatch
Picture if you will seven deadly human beings
blessed with the gift of speech, the power to reach
each nigga on every street
May the Heavenly Father look down and be proud
of what transpired since the day the seed was planted
The G grew but we knew he'd rise up quick
Smoked out, loc'ed out, all into shit
Just me and my dogs livin like hogs
Outlaw Immortalz
What follows is the story, what proceeded was the glue
What lies between is the fiction
Don't fuck around and make it true
[Tupac]
Hahahahahaha
My adversaries crumble when we rumble it's a catastrophe
I pull revenge on bitch niggaz that blasted me
Plus my alias is Makaveli
A loaded three-fifty-seven with hollow points to a nigga belly
Bust him to see if he bleed, he shoulda never fucked around
with a sick-ass nigga like me
They call my name out and niggaz run, best be prepared
for the Outlawz, here we come
[Hussein Fatal]
They call me Hussein Fatal, it's a two game table
I'm robbin ya niggaz cradle wit a knife in your navel
Rap-related criminally activated and evil
I wouldn't wanna be you behind my fuckin Desert Eagle
Till the end, I'm tellin all friends and enemies
You see what I got to make you freeze, to touch me you need ten of these
Complete most, wanted on the streets of the East coast
Young Gunz fire and niggaz bleed, I see Mo
[Kastro]
I be shinin like white diamonds and crystal, glistenin holdin pistols
The mission's simple, fold up and roll up dead presidentials
Sew up all the potential, million, billion dollar baller potential
Sort it, oughta call on a nigga I'll be sure to get you
Take cash bro, fast yo, for my Kastro
Blast and I'ma last yo past all these Glass Joes
and assholes who claim, like they be runnin thangs
I be gunnin those same niggaz runnin late, to their fate
[Napoleon]
My alias is motherfuckin Na-poleon, and I'd rather be
robbin again before these motherfuckers leave me sufferin
But the shit ain't nothin, and I got no time for no bluffin
befo' a nigga finish with puttin in work I betta end up with somethin
I think these niggaz got the game fucked up
If they don't believe, that a young nigga like me, would bust (Boo-Yaa!)
Perhaps it's a must, I'm facin cases, fuck probation
is what I'm screamin when these money hungry cops be chasin
[Chorus: Tupac]
Thug nigga till we die, no mercy
on these playa hatin bitches, ask me why - when we ride!
Thug nigga till we die, no mercy
on these playa hatin bitches, ask me why - when we ride!
[Mussolini]
It's the imperial serial killer, alias Mussolini
Mentally unstable G status, so you can't see me
Drug warlord, riding Concorde jets
Rag Vette's, shakin bitches and snitches and trippin on sets
Ingle-Watts banger, keepin one in the chamber
For the anger that I build inside, when it's time to ride
Suicidal thoughts lurk fuckin no end to revenge
Fuck any, my alias Mussolini
[Idi Amin]
They call me Idi, from the side of seedy
Young nigga greedy, so I'm runnin up on these niggaz easy
It ain't nuttin, cause if they wantin somethin, so I'ma commence
to dumpin stomp down and struck up while my beat is bumpin, Thuggin
to my fuckin last nut, with Lo-Pole and Kastro
Who you thought was on that asshole, don't ask though
Outlaw Immortalz doin this dit-nirt on the sli-zow
Ain't no chance to hide when we ride
[Khadafi]
My alias Khadafi, Trump tight so feds can't copy
Six-three and cocky quick to hit your bitch if she drop me
Severely addicted to livin like a fuckin felon
while beefin with rookie cops the cookie rocks a nigga sellin
Since a short I been livin life defiant, nickel plated chrome
Got this baby Capone lookin like a giant, and I ain't lyin
It's like it's me against myself with all these
backstabbin snakes grabbin at my fuckin wealth
[Mo Khomeini]
Mo Khomeini goes terrorist, mad man killer
The bottom of the river where the body lays and shivers
I'm that nigga with the fifty cap pouch, with the murderous stacks
that increase, while these motherfuckers eat beef
It's been a long road, a lot of episodes
And as the glock loads, I gotta teach hoes
Reach hoes, make em feel a nigga when I'm mashin
Now I'm surpassin any assassin
[Chorus 2X]
[Tupac]
Hahahaha, Outlaw Immortalz baby
Y'all niggaz can't fade this ol crazy shit

Hahaha!  Well I ain't prejudiced, I don't give a fuck
This is what it sounds like - when we ride on our enemies
BEYOTCH!  When we ride on our enemies
[Verse One]
HEYYYY!  Got some static for some niggaz on the other side of town
Let my little cousin K roll, he's a rider now
What they want from us motherfuckin thug niggaz?
Used to love niggaz now I plug niggaz, and slug niggaz
Am I wrong?  Niggaz makin songs, tryin to get with us
Must be gone on stress weed, in the West we trust
To the chest I BUST!  Then we ride 'til the sun come
shinin back to brighten up the sky, many die
Heard the Fugees was tryin to do me - look bitch!
I cut yo' face, this ain't no motherfuckin movie
THEN!  We watch the other two die slow
Castrated entertainin at my motherfuckin sideshow
BAM!  Set my plan in mo', time to exterminate my foes
I can't stand you hoes, uhh
Now label this my fuckin trick shot
My lyrics runnin all you cowards out of hip-hop
When we RIDE - on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies
I bet you motherfuckers die, when we ride, on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies
Bet all you motherfuckers die, when we ride, on our enemies
[Verse Two]
Come take a journey through my mind's eye
You crossed the game, don't explain, nigga time to die, say goodbye
Watch my eyes when I pull the trigger
So right before you die you bow before a bigga nigga, now dry yo' eyes
You was HEARTLESS on yo' hits
Niggaz love to scream peace after they start some shit - pay attention
Here's a word to those that robbed me
I murder you then I, run a train on Mobb Deep!  Don't fuck with me
Nigga you're barely livin, don't you got sickle cell?
See me have a seizure on stage, you ain't feelin well, hell
How many niggaz wanna be involved?
See I was only talkin to Biggie, but I'll kill allay'all, then ball
Then tell Da Brat to keep her mouth closed
Fuck around and get tossed up, by the fuckin Outlawz
Before I leave, make sure everybody HEARD
Know I meant, EVERY MOTHERFUCKIN WORD
When we ride on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies
Make sure everybody die, when we ride, on our enemies
When we ride on our enemies, hehe
I make sure everybody die, when we ride, on our enemies

Where Do We Go From Here (interlude) 
Power.. pow.. power...
Guess who's back?  Hahaha, here we go
It's ninety-fo', what's next?
Power.. enter my world
I guess this year gonna be a motherfucker for real niggaz
I swear these playa haters done got a taste of power
It ain't all good in the hood
Least not on my side, from where I stand
And the law?  Man, fuck the law!
Niggaz must outthink, outstep, and continuously outsmart
the motherfuckin law, in every way
Key word in ninety-four is 'down low'
Gots to be struggling
I see how the rich got theirs
Nigga I'm legit, shit
Where do we go from here?
(Who's afraid, of the punk police?
To my niggaz run the streets, fuck peace) -- 
[repeat in background]
Heyyy niggaz, where your heart at?
See motherfuckers killin babies, killin mommas
Killin kids, puttin this in they motherfuckin mark
Now what type of mixed up trick would kill the future of our race
before he would he look his enemy dead in the eye, and open fire?
These crazy motherfuckers got toys with guns
Jails for guns, but still, no god damn jobs
And they wonder why we loc'n up
Where do we go from here?
Where do we go?
[singers singing variations of 'Where do we go from here']
All you niggaz out there
The clouds shook, the world listened
We stood together in April of ninety-two
With duty, and a sense of honor
There is no limit to what WE can achieve
That's all on us... us...
Not my niggaz, not the whites, not the enemies
or none of them motherfuckers, US
What can WE do? Shit
I declare a death sentence to all child molestors
Fake-ass bitches, male and female
And all you punk-ass snitches
We can do without your asshole
Let no man break, what we set
Where do we go from here?
Rest in peace, to Cato, I miss you
All the other real G's that passed away in ninety-three
In ninety-four, and more
What do we do? For us?

White Man's World 
I ain't saying I'm innocent of all this
I'm just saying
This song is for y'all
For all the times I mess up
when we mess up
Dear sister
Got me twisted up in prison
I miss yah
Crying
Looking at my nieces and newphews picture
They say don't let this cruel world get yah
Kinda suspicious,
Swearing one day you might leave me
for someone thats richer
Twist the cap off the bottle
I Take a sip And see tommorrow
Gotta make if I have to Beg and Borrow
Reading love letters
late night, locked down, and quiet
If brothers don't recieve their mail
Best believe we riot
Eating Jack mat
Staring at walls of Silence
Inside this cage
Where they captured all my rage and violence
In time I learned a few lessons
Never fall for riches
Aplogizies to my TRUE sisters
Far from bitches
Help me raise my black nation
Reperations are due
Its true
Caught up in this world
I took advantage of you
So tell the babies how I love them
Precious boys and girls
Born black in this white mans world
and all I heard was
[Chorus]
Who knows what tommorrow brings
In this world where everyone lies
Where to go
No matter how far I find
To let you know
That You're not alone
Being born with less
I must confess
Only adds on to the stress
Two gunshots to my homies head
Died in his rest
Shot him to death
and Left him bleeding for his family to see
I pass his casket
Gently asking
Is there heaven for G's?
My homeboys doing life
Begging mama be stressing
Shedding tears
When her son finally ask that questions
Where my daddy at?
Mama, Why we live so poor?
Why you crying?
Heard you late night
Throught my bedroom door
Now do you love me mama?
Why do they keep calling me nigger?
Get my wieght up, with my hate
and pay 'em back when I'm bigger
Still thugging in this jail cell
MIssing my block
Hearing brothers screaming all night
Wishing they'd stop
Proud to be black
But why do we act like
We don't love oursleves
Don't look around
busta (you sucka)
Check yourselves
know what if means to be black
whether a man or girl
we're still struggling in this
White man's world
[Chorus]
(we must fight) 
Who knows what tommorrow brings
In this world where everyone lies
Where to go
No matter how far I find
To let you know
That You're not alone
So tell me why you changed
Choosing new direction
In a blink of an eye
My time away just made perfection
You think I'd die
Not gonna cry
Why should I care
Like we holding on to love
Thats no longer there
Can you please help me
God Bless me please 
Keep my seeds healthy
Banging on my enemies Bleed
While my G's wealthy
Hoping they bury me
With ammunition, weed, and shells
Just in case they trip in heaven
Ain't no G's hell
Sister sorry for the pain
That I caused your heart
I know I'll change 
If yah help me
But Don't fall apart
Rest In Peace
To Latasha, Little Yummy, and Kato
To much for this cold world to take
Ended up being fatal
Every women in America
Especially Black
Bear with me, can't you see
We're under attack
I never meant to cause drama
To my sister and Mama
Will we make it
To better times
In this white man worlds

Who Do U Believe In 
(feat. Kadafi (Outlawz))
[Intro: 2Pac]
Let us pray
Heavenly Father, hear a nigga down here
Before I go to sleep
Tell me, who do you believe in?
Who do you believe in?
[Verse One: 2Pac]
I see mothers in black cryin, brothers in packs dyin
Plus everybody's high, too doped up to ask why
Watchin our own downfall, witness the end
It's like we don't believe in God cause we livin in sin
I asked my homie on the block why he strapped, he laughed
Pointed his pistol as the cop car passed and blast
It's just another murder, nobody mourns no more
My tear drops gettin bigger but can't figure what I'm cryin for
Is it the miniature caskets, little babies
Victims of a stray, from drug dealers gone crazy
Maybe it's just the drugs, visions of how the block was
Crack came and it was strange how it rocked us
Perhaps the underlyin fact they hide explain genocide
It's when we ride on our own kind
What is it we all fear, reflections in the mirror
We can't escape fate, the end is gettin nearer
[Chorus 2X: 2Pac]
Who do you believe in?
I put my faith in God, blessed and still breathin
And even though it's hard, that's who I believe in
Before I'm leavin, I'm askin the grievin - who do you believe in?
[Verse Two: 2Pac]
Can't close my eyes cause all I see is terror
I hate the man in the mirror
Cause his reflection makes the pain turn realer
Times of Armageddeon, murder in mass amounts
In this society where only gettin the cash counts
I started out as a beginner
Entered the criminal lifestyle became a sinner
I make my money and vacate, evade prison
Went from the chosen one to outcast, unforgiven
And all the Hennessy and weed can't hide, the pain I feel inside
You know, it's like I'm livin just to die
I fall on my knees and beg for mercy, not knowin if I'm worthy
Livin life thinkin no man can hurt me
So I'm askin -- before I lay me down to sleep
Before you judge me, look at all the shit you did to me, my misery
I rose up from the slums, made it out the flames
In my search for fame will I change?  I'm askin
[Chorus]
[Verse Three: Kadafi]
Faith in Allah, believe in me and this plastic
Cause so far I done witnessed to many dead niggaz in caskets
With they chest plates stretched like elastic
And what's worse I'm on front line, holdin down camp, still mashin
Heard my cousin, one of the old heads from the block
Just came home October of '95 back in Yardsville stuck
with a three to five, if he don't act up, now he realize
If you don't stay wise, then in this game you fucked
Talk to my baby girl, give me the word on what she heard
One of the grimmies is snitchin, Diamond a stool pigeon I talked to him
He said he didn't, my man said he did, in fact he's sure
Cause he just came home off of bail
[2Pac]
 Now tell me
[Chorus]
[Outro: spoken word]
Who do you believe in?
Is it Buddah, Jehovah, or Jah?  Or Allah?
Is it Jesus?  Is it God?  Or is just yourself?
Definately not to be imposed, being a demon
Because this is the joy of believing!
Men, to believe in yourselves
But for sure, the higher power
Resides only to ride in the heart of the true
From the soul, of the man; for truth never has an alibi
In the poetry, or in it's realm
That's what pulls all words together
Just to understand, that every man, is his OWN man
And only man can satisfy the man
Only the soul of the man, the feelings of the man
The for realness of the man
You can't shake the man when you feel the man you know the man
And you gotta call yourself because you are that man
[2Pac]
Who do you believe in?
I put my faith in God, blessed and still breathin
[singing while 2Pac speaks]
Who do you believe in?  Put my faith in God, and
Blessed and still breathin
[singer + (2Pac)]
Even though it's hard (Who do you believe in?)
That's who I believe in (Put my faith in God)
Before I'm leavin (Even though it's hard)
I'm askin the grievin
(Before I'm leavin I'm askin the grievin - who do you believe in?)
Who do you believe in? (Who do you believe in?)
Who do you (Blessed and still breathin)
Oh blessed, oh blessed
(Before I'm leavin I'm askin the grievin - who do you believe in?)
[singer]
Oh who do you 
Do you believe in 
Hohhhhh-ohhhhh
[2Pac over singer]
Who do you believe in?
I put my faith in God, blessed and still breathin
And even though it's hard, that's who I believe in
Before I'm leavin I'm askin the grievin - who do you believe in?
[singer + (2Pac)]
I'm askin (Who do you believe in?)
I'm askin you (Put my faith in God)

Who Do You Love 
[Intro: Tupac]
Maybe its the thug in me
Maybe its the thug in me
Maybe its the thug in me
Maybe its the thug in me
Maybe its the thug in me
[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Ever since I was a young scrub
I was a thug on the corner with my niggaz slangin drugs
I'm runnin from the narcs when they pass by dont ask why
I'm a hustler till my ass die
Even if I do come up I be ready when they run up, huh
I'll be a nut to put my gun up, huh
I never trust these hoes at all, fucking with them tramp ass sluts who Suppose to fall
Since she played you for you money but the shit was cool
Guess its true niggaz be bitches too
You cant see how she worked you, all up in her skirt
Now you looking like a jerk, cause she hurt you
Now heads up dont be a playa hater
Just peep game keep your mind on your money watch the bitch change
See hoes love thugs, and thugs love loot
Hand it over motherfucker before I shoot
Who do u love
[Chorus (x2): 2Pac]
Maybe it's the thug in me
Maybe it's the thug in me
Tell me, Who do you love?
Maybe its the thug in me
Maybe its the thug in me
Who do you love?
[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Im livin that
Thug life baby, steady smoking endo going crazy
Baby come and hug me when you rub me, turn the lights down
We in the dark do you love me
Everyboy is talking bout they know me
But they aint down like my motherfucking homies
Tell me what you need when you see me
And we can get it on biatch take it easy
Don't try to hold me, control me
But you can take my number, baby call me when you lonely
Cause its a mans world, aint no need to ask why
I'm high till I die, and strapped with my 4-5
Cause you can loose it in the gutter
I wonder if I die by the hands of another broke motherfucker
They call me the alcoholer I'm all in, thug 4 life nigga ballin
I'm gettin tired of these hoes tryna play me
You can't fade me, me and my niggaz going crazy
All day long Im straight thuggin, and contantly mean muggin
Breakin the bitches that be buggin, tell me who do you love
[Chorus (x2): 2Pac]
Maybe it's the thug in me
Maybe it's the thug in me
Tell me, Who do you love?
Maybe its the thug in me

Why U Turn On Me 
(Ol' switcheroo-ass, bitch made motherfuckers..)
Outlaw nigga, Westside, throw it up
Hahaha.. had love for 'em, but why you turnin on me?
Why me?  Westside, how you do it boy?
[2Pac]
I went from, nothin to somethin now they all wanna see me fall
And the player haters hate to see a thug nigga ball
And they say we hate the East coast, but that's funny
Got a lot of love for, any niggaz gettin money
I made a song about my enemies and niggaz tripped
It was hip-hop until Tupac fucked Biggie bitch
Y'all niggaz hypocrites and bitch made
Now either love me or hate me but real thug niggaz get paid
Have me catchin cases all across the nation
I went to jail to bail to barely on probation
They got a player facin three strikes, and we might
just blast God bless the child that can get cash
But all these niggaz turnin and never learn
Got a long line of niggaz player hatin me but gettin burned
Talk a lot of shit but youse a trick in drag
Like the Mack make you fall back and stick yo' ass for back pay
[Chorus: singers + 2Pac]
Why you wanna turn on me?
Never thought you would backstab me (Why y'all turnin on me?)
When you niggaz see me you flee (Why me?)
Cause I'm a T-H with the U-G.. (Why me?)
Why you wanna turn on me?
Never thought you would backstab me
When you niggaz see me you flee
Cause I'm a T-H with the U-G
[add to line seven of Chorus first time: "Yeah nigga!"]
[2Pac]
It, started so innocent, but ended in the fifth precinct
Approach the juvenile delinquent, we still decent
Playin catch and kiss, used to diss the herbs
Fuck school we was skippin drink a fifth on the curb
Me and you, no closer two, while drinkin brew
What you need nigga?  Anything at all come to me nigga
You can wear my clothes and my gold for the hoes
Gave you the keys to the jeep, offered my home as an open door
But then you picked a new direction, in the blink of an eye
My time away just made perfection, did you think I'd die?
I never got a single visit yet I carry on
All my old friends too busy now my money gone
Said I got raped in jail, picture that? {*laughter*}
Revenge is a payback bitch, get your gat
Fuck {Wendy Williams} and I pray you choke
on the next dick down your throat, for turnin on me
[Chorus]
[2Pac]
I put Jenny Craig on your fat ass, you fat troll
Anybody ever seen {Wendy Williams} fat ass?
Why you always wearin Spandex you fat bitch?
I know your pussy stinks, you fat hoe
I'm puttin Jenny Craig on you bitch
I'm about to put a twenty-thousand dollar, hit
through Jenny Craig to come find yo' ass
and put you in a fat farm, you fat bitch!
Thug Life, Outlaw, Westside bitch
It's Tupac so you know who said it
And for everybody who didn't like what I said about that other trick
and Mobb Deep, fuck you too nigga!
If a nigga didn't want to get talked about
he shouldn'ta stepped in the fuckin ring
If Tyson don't want to get knocked out
he don't step in the fuckin ring, that's how the shit go
When Tyson get in the ring, he knock motherfuckers out!
Well that's what Tupac gon' do
When niggaz come against me, I'ma knock they punk ass out!
One way or the motherfuckin other
This old motherfuckin nigga in the South told me nigga
It's more than one way to skin a cat
It's more than one way to shoot a gat
It's more than one way to die nigga
When I'm through, everybody cry nigga
This is how we do it
[Chorus]
[2Pac]
Fuck you too nigga!

Wonder Why They Call U 
[Chorus: 2Pac]
You wonda why they call U bitch
You wonda why they call U bitch.
You wonda why they call U bitch
You wonda why they call U bitch.
You wonda why they call U bitch
You wonda why they call U bitch.
[Verse One: 2Pac]
Look here Miss Thang
hate to salt your game
but yous a money hungry woman
and you need to change.
In tha locker room
all the homies do is laugh.
High five's cuz anotha nigga 
played your ass.
It was said you were sleeezy
even easy
sleepin around for what 
you need
See it's your thang 
and you can shake it how you wanna.
Give it up free 
or make your money on the corner.
But don't be bad and play the game
get mad and change.
Then you wonda why these muthafuckas
call you names.
Still lookin' for a way out
and that's OK 
I can see you wanna stray
there's a way out.
Keep your mind on your money,
enroll in school.
And as the years pass by 
you can show them fools.
But you ain't tryin' to hear me
cuz your stuck,
you're headin' for the bathroom
'bout to get tossed up.
Still lookin' for a rich man
you dug a ditch,
got your legs up
tryin' to get rich.
I love you like a sista 
but you need to switch
and that's why they called
U bitch, I betcha.
[Chorus]
[Verse Two: 2Pac]
You leave your kids with your mama
cuz your headin' for the club
in a skin tight miniskirt
lookin' for some love.
Got them legs wide open 
while you're sittin' at the bar
Talkin' to some nigga 
'bout his car.
I guess he said he 
had a Lexxxus, what's next?
You headin' to his car for some sex
I pass by
can't hold back tears inside
cuz, lord knows
for years I tried.
And all the other people
on my block hate your guts
Then you wonda why they stare
and call you slut.
It's like your mind don't understand
you don't have to kill your
dreams ploten'
schemes on a man
Keep your head up, legs closed, eyes open
either a nigga wear a rubber or he die smokin' 
I'm hearin' rumors so you need to switch 
and niggas wouldn't call you bitch, I betcha.
[Chorus]
[Verse Three: 2Pac]
I guess times gettin' hard
even harder for you
cuz, hey now, got a baby
on the way now
More money from the county
and thanks to the welfare
you're about to
get your hair done.
Got a dinner date 
can't be late
trick or treat, sweet thang
got anotha trick to meet.
The way he did it
it was smooth
plottin' while he gamin' you
So baby, peep tha rules.
I shoulda seen it in the first case
the worst case
I shoulda never called you back 
in the first place.
I remember back in high school
baby you was fast 
straight sex
and barely move your ass.
But now things change
cuz you don't look the same
let the ghetto get the best of you
baby, that's a shame
Caught HIV and now you 'bout to be deceased
and finally be in peace.
So where your niggas at now
cuz everybody left
they stepped 
and left you on your own
See I loved you like a sista
but you died to quick
And that's why we called U bitch, I betcha.
[Chorus]
[Outro: 2Pac]
Dear Ms. Deloris Tucker
keep stressen me
fuckin' with a muthafucken mind
I figured you wanted to know
you know
why we call them hos bitches
and maybe this might help you understand
it ain't personal
strictly business baby
strictly business
So If you wonder why we call U bitch
You wonder why we call U bitch
If you wonder why we call U bitch
You wonder why we call U bitch

Words 2 My First Born 
(feat. Above the Law)
Hehehe, these are my words to my first born..
[2Pac]
Can you picture, young niggaz in a rush to grow
til hard timers in the pen, had to crush his throat
Probably never even saw it comin - too busy bullshittin
Caught him with his mouth runnin; ain't this a bitch
They got me twisted in this game
The feds and the punk, po-lice pointin pistols at my brain
I wonder if I'm wrong cause I'm thugged out
My homies murdered execution style runnin in the drug house
what was supposed to be a easy hit - now shit is flipped
cause niggaz died over bullshit - it's not my dream
I'm seein pictures of a broken man, no witnesses
Only the questions of who smoked the man, young adolescents
in our prime live a life of crime, though it ain't logical
We hobble through these tryin times, livin blind
Lord help me with my troubled soul
Why all my homies had to die 'fore they got to grow?
And right before I put my head on the pillow, say a prayer one love
to the thugs in heaven I'll see you there
It's written for the young and dumb that wasn't warned
Help you make it through the storm
My words to my first born, feel me
.. My words to my first born
.. My words to my first born
[2Pac]
Since my very first day on this earth, I was cursed
So I knew, that the birth of a child would make my life worse
And though it hurt me there was no distortion
Cause wild seeds can't grow, we need more abortions
Quiet your soul, cause you know what you had to do
And so did victims of a world they never came to
I understand it's a better day comin
Sometimes cats be sleepin on the dead end
drivin with the car runnin blinded
Ain't no love in the hood only hearts torn
Love letters to the innocent and unborn
All the babies that died up on the table
Wasn't able to breathe, cause the family wasn't able
Can't - blame her I would do the same
All I could give it was my debt and my last name
Cause in the game things change livin up and down
This hard life got me walkin with my head down
Flashin frowns wasn't meant to be, was I wrong?
But I'll never get to know, so I carry on
It's written for the young and dumb that wasn't born
My words to my first born, feel me
.. My words to my first born
.. Mmm! (Yeah) These are the words to my first born
.. Hey nigga talk to your born, talk to your seed nigga
[Above the Law]
Two thousand somethin somethin it's a new era
A nigga's too real, now see shit too clear
See there's more than just this scrilla and this tilt
(What else is it dawg?)
The velvet and the silk, and makin sure my kittens got they milk
(Hoo!) Gotta fill this mattress, let my kids know I'm at this
Attack this, the Mack must roll, hood stroll
Ain't no question is it?  Above the Law hustlers
If it's related to chips, homey we'll handle ya
Yo..
Although we never take advantage though we always into ery'thang
By all means, stack green, gangsta lean
They say money make the world go 'round
So only 'ssociate yourself with paper chasers
and niggaz that's truly down - and keep God first
And give thanks for the good times, as well as when it hurts
It's player haters every corner you hit
Touchin their tits, hella thick, tryin to get you for yo' grip
I know you stressed out and fed up
But come out, gun-blazin, and keep yo' head up
You can call it what you want to but it ain't gon' change
Above the Law, 2Pac, O.G.'s in this rap game
And we done lived a long hard life
And we done shed so many tears under these bright lights
Y'all, although we grew up, corrupted and scorned
We still got a lot of wisdom, to give to our first born
[2Pac]
What you gon' tell your kids nigga?
Who was you?  What was you doin?  How did you put it down?
These my words to my motherfuckin first born
so they can know, y'knahmean?  Hehehe
Ain't nuttin but a motherfuckin rider, Wessyde 'til I die
That's all it was, it's a crooked-ass hand they deal a motherfucker
I just played to win, just played to win
Motherfucker gotta bet agains the odds..

Words Of Wisdom 
Killing us one by one 
In one way or another
American will find a way to eliminate the problem
One by one
The problem is 
the troubles in the black youth of the ghettos
And one by one 
we are being wiped off the face of this earth
At an extremely alarming rate
And even more alarming is the fact 
that we are not fighting back
Brothers, sistas, niggas
When I say niggas it is not the nigga we are grown to fear
It is not the nigga we say as if it has no meaning
But to me
It means Never Ignorant Getting Goals Accomplished, nigga
Niggas what are we going to do
Walk blind into a line or fight 
Fight and die if we must like niggas
This is for the masses the lower classes
The ones you left out, jobs were givin', better livin'
But we were kept out
Made to feel inferior, but we're the superior
Break the chains in out brains that made us fear yah
Pledge a legiance to a flag that neglects us
Honour a man that who refuses to respect us
Emancipation, proclamation, Please!
Nigga just said that to save the nation
These are lies that we all accepted
Say no to drugs but the governments' keep it
Running through our community, killing the unity
The war on drugs is a war on you and me
And yet they say this is the Home of The Free
But if you ask me its all about hypocrisy
The constitution, Yo, it don't apply to me
Lady Liberty still the bitch lied to me
Steady strong nobody's gonna like what I pumpin'
But its wrong to keeping someone from learning something
So get up, its time to start nation building
I'm fed up, we gotta start teaching Chaldean
That they can be all that they wanna to be
There's much more to life than just poverty
This is definitely ahhh words of wisdom
AMERIKA, AMERIKA, AMERIKKKA  
I charge you with the crime of rape, murder, and assault
For suppressing and punishing my people 
I charge you with robbery for robbing me of my history
I charge you with false imprisonment for keeping me
Trapped in the projects
And the jury finds you guilty on all accounts
And you are to serve the consequences of your evil schemes
Prosecutor do you have any more evidence
Words of Wisdom
They shine upon the strength of an nation
Conquer the enemy on with education
Protect thy self, reach with what you wanna do
Know thy self, teach what we been through
On with the knowledge of the place, then
No one will ever oppress this race again
No Malcolm X in my history text
Why is that?
Cause he tried to educate and liberate all blacks
Why is Martin Luther King in my book each week?
He told blacks, if they get smacked, turn the other cheek
I don't get it, so many questions went through my mind
I get sweated, They act as if asking questions is a crime
But forget it, one day I'm gonna prove them wrong
Now every brother had to smother on the welfare line
The American dream, though it seems it attainable
They're pulling your sleeve, don't believe 
Cause it will strangle yah
Pulling the life of your brain, I can't explain
Beg as you can obtain from which you came
Swear that your mother is living in equality
Forgetting your brother that's living her apology
Thought they had us beat when they took our kids
But the battle ain't over till the black man sings
Words of Wisdom
But the battle ain't over till the black man sings
Words of Wisdom
NIGHTMARE thats what I am
America's nightmare
I am what you made me
The hate and evil that you gave me
I shine of a reminder of what you have done to my people
for Four hundred plus years
You should be scared 
You should be running
You should be trying to silence me
ha ha 
But you can not escape fate
Well it is my turn to come
Just as you rose you shall fall
By my hands
Amerika, You reap what you sow
2pacalypse America's Nightmare
Ice Cube and Da Lench Mob America's Nightmare
Above the Law America's Nightmare
Paris America's Nightmare
Public Enemy America's Nightmare
Krs-One America's Nightmare
Mutulu Shakur America's Nightmare
Geronimo Pratt America's Nightmare

Y'all Don't Know Us 
[Young Noble]
Yo, I can see 
That you obviously don't know me or my homies
We O-U-T Lawz, f**k the phonies
A wise hustler once told me, it's on you
Though it was dreams when he first told me Now it's true
I got love for you only to a certain exstend
ni**as ain't worth s**t
Cops and ride d**k permits
I heard this and heard that 
About them O-U-T Lawz
Some of them soldiers got shot
Some of them soldiers fell off
f**k yall now everybody tied to us
Hollering out a ni**a name 
But never said what up
That s**t critical, dispicable, unforgiveable
I too like Hot ??
Your own fan won't remember you
Thuggin but we still spriutual, clear lyrical
I'm like the f**kin Deff Squad 
My ears ain't hearin' yall
Pump fearin' yall
But damn I ain't even wantin' to scare yall
Listen to what I tell yall
f**k the world, 
Your baby moms and your baby girl
You muthaf**kas so fake, 
Yo they made me wanna earl
Blake, hate snakes thug hatin the degree
Outlawz on a paper chase
Can you relate thug ni**az
[Napoleon Chorus]
We will never fall
Thru it all, we'll always stand tall
Cause in the end we'll be remembered as some young muthaf**ka soldiers
And if you believe in that s**t that you heard
Y'all dont know us, y'all dont know us
[Napoleon]
Now I been trapped down 
And f**ked since day one
This industructional style of mine ain't no fun
Where I'm from
You sure to see about 10 ni**az in a bedroom
Eating off the same spoon
Sweeping with the same broom
It's hazard, it's you don't want yo life 
Well give me grab it
I was born inside a love zone
With a glock-nine young marriage
It's critical
Then one of them sat down living so 
Mystikal and empoious
With a heart full of anger it's so redicilous
So give me some with 21-gun soldier salute
With a 19-inch black handle snake knife in my boots
I'm straight from the strong, thug to your life
Right to yo wrong, I'll put the good to your evil
I'm the shells to your chrome, you dig that?
I'm life, I'll bring the moon to your night
I'll put the d**k to your wife 
And I'm the Jesuz of your Christ
You dig that? respect this
I'll bring the end to your claw
I'll bring the loc to your heart
And I'll put the snoop on yo dogs
You hear me? 
We follow, this little bullet so hollow
I can promise that estacy ain't promised tomorrow
With this two man mades
Me and my soul death astrayed
I watch my parents get blowed away
Now look what it made
I'm something to face
This ludacy then with me, then with chemistry
Got my eyes on you, the first time you cross me
I'll be frying you, cause y'all don't know me
[Young Noble Chorus]
We will never fall
Thru the war, we'll always stand tall (Why)
Cause in the end we'll be remembered as some young muthaf**ka soldiers
[E.D.I]
When we was kids, the loving felt good
But of course have the respect
Though it's even better
Now for this chedder
ni**az is laying deader 
Then Malcom and Martin put together
Oh Lord only knows where we'll end up
Remember what Pac said
Watch the f**kin signs
But we wasn't listening
Too busy trippin off his shine
Now one time for my muthaf**kin' Outlawz
Napoleon, Noble, and Kastro 
May we all roll
And if you don't know 
We got the rap game petro
Scared cause we bout to release 
Like heavy metal
Nationwide, underground 
We running the ghettos
Stealing all of ya fan base like we kleptos
bi**h I can't let go
I been strugglin' too long, thuggin' too long
And ni**az is stealing my s**t 
And busting it wrong
Hot shots holla back when you get 'em
Outlawz'll sic 'em, bustin back at the system
Military wisdom
Preparing myself for armegeddom
Breaking my balls at this game
Knowing it's a dead end
And my only weapon 
Is my believe that I'm superior
Yeah we the muthaf**kas 
That you ni**az is liery off
Controling my steam
Knowing my team to deserve more
f**k the reframe
Stick to the game and earn more
Holding my head, rolling the head with focus
Laughing inside
Cause deep inside y'all don't know us
[Young Noble Chorus]
We will never fall
Thru it all, we'll always stand tall (Why)
Cause in the end we'll be remembered as some young muthaf**ka soldiers
And if you believe in that s**t that you heard
Y'all dont know us, y'all dont know us
We will never fall (Never)
Thru the war, we'll always stand tall
Cause in the end we'll be remembered as some young muthaf**ka soldiers
And if you believe in that s**t that you heard
Y'all dont know us, y'all dont know us

Young black male
I try to effect by kicking the facts
and stacking much mail
I'm packing a gat cuz guys wanna jack
and fuck goin to jail
Cuz I ain't equipped to stop how I look
I don't sell ya-yo
They teachin a brother like I was in books
Follow me into a flow
I'm sure you know, which way to go
I'm hittin em out of the dopes
So slip on the slope, let's skip on the flow
I'm fuckin the sluts and hoes
The bigger the butts the tighter the clothes
The gimminy jimminy grows
Then whaddya know, it's off with some clothes
Rowd when the crowd says hoe
That let's me know, they know I can flow
Love when they come to my shows
I get up and go, with skins before
When I'm collecting my dough
I never respect, the one that I back
The quicker the nigga can rap
The bigger the check, now watch how they sweat
What kind of style is that?
The style of a mack, and ready to jack
I rendered up piles of black
The wacker the pack, the fatter the smack
I hate it when real nigga bust
They hate when I cuss, they threaten to bust
I had enough of the fuss
I bust what I bust, and cuss when I must
They gave me a charge for sales
For selling the tales... of young black males
Yes nigga, N-I-G-G-A niggaz
Ay nigga you can't handle that shit!
Pass that man!
Hit that shit, that's the shit!
It smell like skunk, skunk smell like that nigga momma
We ain't nuttin but some low down dirty niggaz
Keep it real nigga, fuck you nigga!
You ain't givin me near a dime on this real motherfucker
Fuck St. Ide's it's an Old E thing baby
Strictly some of that Hennesee
Can I drink with you fellas?  Can I get it on it?
Fuck you capo.  You ain't in baby.

Young Niggaz 
I wanna dedicate this one to Robert 'Yummy' Sanderford
and all other lil' young niggaz that's in a rush to be gangstas
As a young nigga, I'm almost ?swellin? in the wind
Give anythang, to be that innocent again, when I was ten
I didn't bang but I was hangin with the homies
tell them niggaz started slangin that they don't know me
I got my hustle on, learned to ignore what couldn't pay me
Lately I've been tryin to make a bill-ion, can you play me
with that jealousy they need to miss me, don't sweat me
If them cowards really want me, come get me, and even I
someday will die but I'm cautious, I'm fin' to ride
Put down the top, now we flossin
Hit the freeway, let the wind blow, drop the window
Workin with a twenty sack of indo, feelin good
Stop through the hood, grab the young thugs
And I can't help but reminisce back when we slung drugs, know it's bad
but all we had was our hopes and dreams
Couldn't see unless we learned to slang dope to fiends
as young niggaz
He's the kind of G like everybody knows
As a young nigga
He's always G'd up, from head to toe
My memories as a young nigga
Always got it blown like Al Capone
Young nigga
He's the downest G I've ever known
Back in Junior High, when we was barely gettin by, when daddy died
That's when my momma started gettin high
My neighborhood was full of drivebys, couldn't survive
All our homies livin short lives, I couldn't cry
Told my momma if I did die, just put a blunt in my casket
let me get my dead homies high
Come follow me throughout my history, it's just
_Me Against the World_ stuck in misery; as a young nigga
My only thing was to be paid
Life full of riches avoid snitched cause they shady, back in the days
We always found the time to play,
but that's before they taught them gangbangers how to spray
Not just L.A., but in the Bay and in Chicago and even St. Louis
Every stadium that I go, when will they change?
Stuck in the game like a dumb nigga
Remember how it was, to be a young nigga
He's the kind of G like everybody knows
As a young nigga
He's always G'd up, from head to toe
My memories as a young nigga
Always got it blown like Al Capone
Young nigga
He's the downest G I've ever known
I'm tellin you..
.. to be young, have your brains and have every ? and all that
Yo, y'all niggaz don't know how good you really do got it
Muh'fuckers need to just calm down
and peep what the fuck they wanna do for the rest of the life
'Fore you end your life before you BEGIN your life
You dumb nigga
Now that I'm grown, I got my mind on bein somethin
Don't wanna be another statistic, out here doin nuttin
Tryin to maintain in this dirty game, keep it real
and I will even if it kills me, my young niggaz
break away from these dumb niggaz
Put down the guns and have some fun nigga, the rest'll come nigga
Fame is a fast thang, that gangbangin
puttin niggaz in a casket, murdered for hangin
at the wrong place at the wrong time, no longer livin
Cause he threw up the wrong sign, and every day
I watch the murder rate increases, and even worse
the epidemic and diseases, what is the future?
The projects lookin hopeless, where
more and more borhters givin up and don't care
Sometimes I hate when brothers act up, I hit the weed
and I proceed to blow the track up, for young niggaz
He's the kind of G like everybody knows
For these young niggaz
He's always G'd up, from head to toe
My memories as a young nigga
He always got it blown like Al Capone
Take it slow nigga, it's for the young niggaz
He's the downest G I've ever known
As a young nigga
He's the kind of G like everybody knows
He's always G'd up, from head to toe
Memories as a young nigga
He always got it blown like Al Capone
He's the downest G I've ever known
['Pac talking overlaps singing last four lines]
This go out to the young thugs, the have-nots (you know)
Little bad motherfuckers from the block (that's right)
Them niggaz that's thirteen and fourteen
Drivin Cadillacs, Benzes and shit (I see you boy)
Young motherfuckin hustlers (make that money boy)
Stay strong nigga
You could be a fuckin accountant, not a dope dealer
youknowhatI'msayin?  (Go to school nigga, go to school)
Fuck around and, you pimpin out here
You could be a lawyer (really doe)
Niggaz gotta get they priorities straight
(Don't see Johnny Cochran out in this motherfucker)
Really doe.. young niggaz.. little RahRah
(sup nigga) Especially my little cousins don't be no dumb guy
(Don't be a dumb nigga, listen, young niggaz)

Cookies Cream (hier Ist De Sommer) 
Worte sind so nebenschlich
Verglichen damit was zwischen uns ist
Dieses bekannte gefhl
Lsst uns gttlich sein
Klnge tragen uns dahin
Wo wir alle herkommen
Und wir strahlen von innen
Ineinander hinein
Hier ist der sommer
In cookies cream
Botschaften schweben glitzernd
Durch die luft
So da in jeder entfernung
Wir verbunden sind
Gummibnder aus gefhlen
Ziehen uns durch die nacht
Und die stunden brauchen nur sekunden
Um vorberzugehen

Einem Sonnigen Tag 
An einem sonnigen tag
Seh ich sie ber die strae gehen
Dunkle brille
Sie hat mich nicht gesehen
Sie steht vorm kino um 11
Der film luft schon seit halb zehn
Ein mann kommt raus-sieht traurig aus
Sie sagt sie hat ihn schon gesehen
In einer fremden bar
Sie trinkt zu viel und alle reden laut
Jemand sieht sie lnger an
Da steht sie auf und rennt hinaus
Sie telefoniert
Und zieht sich an
Jacke brille
Irgendetwas fngt von vorne an

Es Wird Morgen 
Es wird morgen und das licht
Sickert wieder durch die jalousien
Er hast gesagt er will sie nicht
Und sie hat ihm schon verziehen
Sie hat's eigentlich geahnt
Sie hat die ewigkeit verplant
Und die wartet jetzt in weiter ferne
Seine sachen sind schon weg
Fr einen guten zweck
Sie warten vor der tr
Und sie ist ganz alleine hier
Und wieder geht die sonne auf
Und woanders wird es nacht
Und wieder steht sie am fenster
Und fragt sich was sie mit dem tag heut macht
Sie wei nicht mehr wo er gerade ist
Heute meldet ihn ihr herz noch als vermisst
Morgen grndet sie einen verein
Der heit nie mehr allein
Oder so hnlich...
Und wieder geht die sonne auf
Und woanders wird es nacht
Und wieder steht sie am fenster
Und fragt sich was sie mit dem tag heut macht
Seine sachen sind schon weg
Fr einen guten zweck
Sie warten vor der tr
Und sie ist ganz alleine hier
Und wieder geht die sonne auf
Und woanders wird es nacht
Und wieder steht sie am fenster
Und fragt sich was sie mit dem tag heut macht

Ich denk an dich
Ich kann nicht anders
An jeder straenecke bleibe ich stehen
Ich denk an dich
Was soll ich machen
Meine gedanken wollen sich nur um dich drehen
Ich sehe dich
In jedem bild
Alle farben werden dein gesicht
Ich hre dich
In jedem ton
Es gibt kein einziges gerusch ohne dich
Ich denk an dich
Und all die menschen
Die vorbergehen seh`ich nicht
Ich denk an dich
Wie du wohl aussiehst
Hier in dem hellen sonnenlicht
Ich sehe dich
Wo niemand ist
Du wartest hinter jeder tr

Wenn alles schweigt
Deine stimme klingt fr immer in mir
Ich bin bei dir
Du bist mir nah
Ich wnsch mir nur
Du wrest da
Ich denk an dich
An deine haare
Die sind doch lnger oder nicht
Ich denk an dich
Wo bist du gerade
Vielleicht lachst du oder sprichst
Ich sehe dich
In anderer zeit

Ich will dich nicht kennen
Will nichts von dir wissen
Wenn wir uns wieder trennen
Werd' ich dich nicht vermissen
Ich hab ein ziel
Ich wei genau was ich nicht will
Langsam geh ich durch die rume
Ich geh durch meine dunklen trume
Ich bin bereit
Trinke tropfenweise zeit

Und ich wei genau, was ich nicht will
Ich will dich nicht kennen
Will nichts von dir wissen

Oben 
Alle wollen oben sein
Oben sein heit super sein
Wir haben unten keine zeit
Jeder holt den andern ein
Darum immer vorne sein
Denn oben ist der blick so weit
Wenn man einmal oben war
Ist die welt erstaunlich klar
Und die aussichten sind schn
Unten ist es auch ok
Doch wenn ich ehrlich in mich seh
Dann mcht ich immer oben sein
High
Oben macht frei
Oben macht schn
Bleib ganz kurz stehen
Hast du alles gut gesehen
High
Hher geht`s kaum
Die ist dein traum
Ewig hier stehen
Hast du alles gut gesehen
Es wird schon runter gehen
Viele schafe trocknen schon
In zweiter dritter generation
Doch auch die erde oben dreht
Ich seh viele klammern fest
An jedem der sich klammern lt
Und hoffen nur da er gut steht
Mit einem kleinen risko
Hilft man auch jemand anderm hoch
Und beobachtete genau
Wer sich lnger oben hlt
Wei wie und wo man runterfllt
Denn andere fallen sehen macht schlau
High
Oben macht frei
Oben macht schn
Bleib ganz kurz stehen
Hast du alles gut gesehen

Hher geht`s kaum
Die ist dein traum
Ewig hier stehen
Hast du alles gut gesehen
Es wird schon runter gehen

Ohne gewicht
Fliegst du durch die welt

Boy I know a place you'll never wanna leave

Do you wanna go to magic city with me (with me)

And I was wonderin' if you would take me to your world.
Heard that there's a place you got,
That both me and you could go.
I won't let my momma know,
We could keep it on the low.
So it's on bring me to your city girl,
I could be your volunteer, you'll be my magician girl.
Back to the room, she put me on the chair.
Just a touch of magic her jeans disappear.
[Chorus]
[Verse 2:]
One minute, two minute, three minute, four,
She dancin' for me now, she's somethin' like a pro.
Call her Miss Houdini cause she's magic with her lips,
Like abracadabra she know where to kiss.
That's somethin' I ain't never seen before,
By the way she move I gotta put her in my video.
This is magic city, my personal fantasy world,
Where I could do whatever with my fantasy girl.
It's 12 o'clock so she know, how I roll.
By one o'clock, she gonna take it to the floor.
Just like magic, take it down low
Take me to your magic place, baby I ain't tryin' to wait.

Take me away be my magical chick.

Ria Maria 
Our moms man
I see you ma
You can shine to this one ma

We was young age
Papa writing letters from the jail sail
Where's daddy 
He's neva round
During father's day at school he neva round (yeah)
I hope he listenin
I hate him for that
He broke your arm
Broke your heart
Can't forgive him for that
Any man with a dick
Could bring to seed to life
But only 
A real man takes care to see his wife
You were pussy hell Armstrong
Don't forget that
You know where we live now
Were the monthly checks at
Momma been there through the loops and stripes
Only a man could raise a man
So what's my future like
Momma thanks for making sure we was loved
When you was hospitalized
Making sure we was hugged
So go ahead and do your thang
Ma is your time to show the world you shine pretty mama of mine
[CHORUS]
You know how beautiful you are 
Pretty mama of mine
Show the world you're a star
Sweet mama of mine

You know how beautiful you are 
Pretty mama of mine
Show the world you're a star
Sweet mama of mine
You're my mother my father
The only girl I care for
Go head and shine
Pretty mama of mine
I used to think life wasn't so fair
When you was bed written
No teeth no hair
Cause you showed us the roads when we was younger
Gave us what you could
And supplied to our hunger
And pops left you with nothing but scars and bad memories
Though your soul was dead you still had energy
He cheated on me
Beat you with no warning
And left us for there when the moth came home
But by the time the wounds healed 
You didn't though
But we had to grow up for you to tell us it all
And is clear now 
He didn't love you at all
But we did
So that there covered it all
Now is yo turn to shine
I gotta let the story retold 
Cause you was there though the sleep and the snow
And the hard times still fresh in my mind
So this song is for you pretty momma of mine
[CHORUS]
You know how beautiful you are 
Pretty mama of mine
Show the world you're a star
Sweet mama of mine
You're my mother my father
The only girl I care for
Go head and shine
Pretty mama of mine
You know how beautiful you are 
Pretty mama of mine
Show the world you're a star
Sweet mama of mine
You're my mother my father
The only girl I care for
Go head and shine
Pretty mama of mine
(SPEAKING)
Yea
Now as hard as it might be to talk bout all this
I gotta let yall know man
We almost lost our mom in june 1996
Through the brain cancer
Man the doctor said she had 6 months to live
She suppose to die around Christmas 
And how you gon tell a lil kid that you aint gon see yo mom anymore 
I know is real hard man 
but thankfully
with the help of god
and helped our prayer
she still here
to this day
so this for you ma
we love you
our ma
[CHORUS]
You know how beautiful you are 
Pretty mama of mine
Show the world you're a star
Sweet mama of mine
You're my mother my father
The only girl I care for
Go head and shine
Pretty mama of mine
You know how beautiful you are 
Pretty mama of mine
Show the world you're a star
Sweet mama of mine
You're my mother my father
The only girl I care for
Go head and shine
Pretty mama of mine

Aye is the mic on

Thinking a lot bout my life and all that 
Thinking bout the goods
And some of the bads u know
So I grab my brother and wrote our life novel
Her it go
[CHORUS]

This is the chapters

The good the bad the pain and disaster
The chapters
Don't want to speak my mind
Bout this hard knocked life in this book of mine 
(ROYAL)
I woke up pops was gone
Young and confused in a broken home
Motel skipping motel living 
Rooms about the size of a hotel kitchen
(Hold on) I been around the block
The year of my life been a round my pops
The years of my life 
I remember nights
Home this with my brother on December nights 
Then mom got sick
Lost her head
A PHD woman with a lost career
6 months to live she could barely walk
All my friend call her dumb for the way she talk
So I thank God she alive today
I sit the night I pray she don't pass away
But that incident 
Grew up in my mind at that time that my heart had innocence 
So this so that
My only cats saying Ro this smoke that 
Life on the room track
At school with the rich
Still broke kicked out of there for the ish that I pitched
Back to the block
I saw drug abuse 
Teenage rape that happened a lot
2006 the time had come we were signed
This is story is chapter 1
(Listen)
[CHORUS]
This is the chapters
The before and after

(LAZE)
Now we closer to our goal 
But still not quite there
Friends grew up 
Their ma
Still cry in tears
Couple lost dreams
But I knew some way to work
That's as how false it seems
05 came 
The year passed away
My best friend had two on the way
Into abortion that was the best for him
But in the miss I lost respect for him (sawrry dawg)
After that my nigga Jay had a seed
His baby momma refused to take him back
No Job he can't make a stack
Anotha victim of the street corner
He turned to rap
How to walk
Before books of life
Still broke
Living round the rich
So I pitched
Went to school but I ditched
Kicked when I was 13
Got a grip (ya happy) (oh well)
Back to the chapters
This is the truth
I'm giving you before and after
From my older brotha hooked on the pipe
My only role model snortin on the white
This man of the household 
I got out so
I was young I was still without dough
Is only right that I rap the truth
So there it go our life that's chapter 2
[CHORUS]

You know all in between
Take out howeva positive you want but negative don't
But we had to give it to ya'll
Oh yea trust me there a lot of more to come

Alien Angel 
Here - follow
Hollow are these haunted hills
Far below the ground
Searchers in the deep reveal
That you could have been
Caught up in
All those empty odds
Alive but not awake
Promises
Am I seeping through?
Are you an angel
Whose ship ran aground?
Can't get a grip
On this planet you've found
Never to look down
Trade in my halo
For feet on the ground
Born in motion
Forward is your only course
Plunge the gaping edge
Fallen into flesh and bone
You could've been
Caught up in
All those empty odds
Alive but not awake
Promises
Am I seeping through?
Are you an angel
Whose ship ran aground?
Can't get a grip
On this planet you've found
Never to look down
Trade in my halo
For feet on the ground
Are you an angel
Whose ship ran aground?
Can't get a grip
On this planet you've found
Never to look down
Trade in my halo
For feet on the ground
Are you an angel?

Amaze Disgrace 
Amaze disgrace
How sweet the sound
Of footfalls in
The underground
And rise my children
Come and play
The perfect earth
She's been blown away
And don't you fear it
When you hear it
Stirring down below
Don't you get that's
How it lets itself into your soul?
These walls are too thin to hide our screams
Amaze disgrace
Oh how sweet it is
Your life's blood bleeds
Along your wrist
And rise my children
Come and see
The perfect earth catastrophe
And don't you fear it
When you hear it
Stirring down below
Don't you get that's
How it lets itself into your soul
These walls are too thin to hide our screams
It was a night like tonight
So many years ago
I was drawn towards the light
Held on too tight; could not let go
And rise my children
Come and play
The perfect earth
She's been blown away
And don't you fear it
When you hear it
Stirring down below
And don't you get that's
How it lets itself into your soul?
And don't you fear it
When you hear it
Stirring down below
Don't you get that's
How it lets itself into your soul?
These walls are too thin to hide our screams

Circus Without Clowns 
This is the night of living dead
They crowd the streets
In search of who they are
And when it's time to go to bed
You can hear them breathe
Like choking on a cigar
And though I'd like to pledge allegiance
I'm afraid it can't be found
So as they fire up their legions
I've got another plan
Some of you won't understand
This is a circus without clowns
Rotting in this town
I try to hold my ground
But that ain't right
That ain't right
We're in a circus without clowns
Rotting in this town
We try to hold our ground
But that ain't right
That ain't right somehow
This is the night of living dead
They watch the screen
But they don't know what it means
And when it's time to lift your head
You hear the scream
Sirens drag you out of your dream
And though I'd like to pledge allegiance
Well I'm afraid it can't be found
So as they fire up their legions
I've got another plan
Some of you won't understand
This is a circus without clowns

But that ain't right

We're in a circus without clowns

But that ain't right

And then they tumble over the edge
You know I'd like to pledge allegiance
But I'm afraid it can't be found
Now I've got another plan
Some of you won't understand
This is a circus without clowns

Dogs Of War 
Good, now that we're finally alone
I get the feeling you know I know
Know right from wrong
And a few give up, and a few give in
We could run away
Ah, but they would hunt us down
What else can I say
But turn this ship around?
Breathe in a vacuum of air
Seek to accumulate your share
Sorry, but life is unfair
And I get the feeling you don't know
Who to believe anymore,
The rabbit who runs or the dogs of war
Great, now that we've been introduced
I get the feeling you know I know
Know you're confused
And a few give up, and a few give in
We could run away
Ah, but they would hunt us down
What else can I say
But turn this ship around?
Breathe in a vacuum of air
Seek to accumulate your share
Sorry, but life is unfair
And I get the feeling you don't know

Dregs 
Awake in the dark
Dreaming of day
Skating my life away
On impossible ice
But I didn't know
Why do I hate me so?
Burn into ash, ash into dust
Aren't these the gods we trust?
Gone out of their minds
In for the kill
But I can remember still...
Days gone by
Welcome to the dregs of my mind
Right on time
Welcome to the dregs of my mind
Welcome to the dregs of my mind
Welcome to the dregs of my mind
Thought of a lie, and
Thought of a bomb
Thought if I played along
That I might slip away
And out on my own
Guess that I should've known
As bullets divide flesh of the sky
Sunlight goes bleeding by
Gone out of their minds
In for the kill
But I can remember still...
Days gone by
Welcome to the dregs of my mind
Right on time
Welcome to the dregs of my mind
Welcome to the dregs of my mind
Welcome to the dregs of my mind
Burn into ash, ash into dust
Aren't these the gods we trust?
Dreaming awake
What can I do?
What ever happened to...
Days gone by
Welcome to the dregs of my mind
Right on time
Welcome to the dregs of my mind
Welcome to the dregs of my mind
Welcome to the dregs of my mind

Monster 
Skin crawls
Wind is walking
Through the walls
Now there's nowhere to run
Heart pray we'll be ok
Now there's nothing to say
But the damage is done
What keeps you up at night, my love?
What turns you on?
Dark shadows turn in the pale blue light
It won't be long
A thousand torches
Beaming in the distance
They bleed from the sky
And as I open my eyes
I see they've come to take me home
How now
Can we allow
We gotta stop 'em somehow
Body over mind
Oh no, now we both know
That there's nowhere to go
And the damage is done
What keeps you up at night, my love?
What turns you on?
Dark shadows turn in the pale blue light
It won't be long
A thousand torches
Beaming in the distance
They bleed from the sky
And as I open my eyes
I see they've come to take me home
And as I float through the sky
I know I've known it all along
And as the stars step aside
I know the battle rages on
A thousand torches
Beaming in the distance
They bleed from the sky

I see they've come to take me home
And as I float through the sky
I know they've come to take me home

One Way Town 
This is a story of a
Roller coaster child
In the city living
Where there once was wild (wild)
I'm not the enemy
Not defending thee
The place where they're sending me
Is such a long way down, down, down
You know you turn the other way
In a one way town
Put your eye to the sky
Plant your feet into the ground
What's the word
Bright as the sun in your eyes
You left a tear in the dust
But you never said goodbye
You say that you're quitting
But you're still gonna do it
Long song skipping on
The record in your head (head)
You say that you're leaving
But you're walking in circles
Running from a memory
That you wanna forget
You know you look the other way
In a one way town
Put your eye to the sky
Plant your feet into the ground
We'll find a world
A place where the light never dies
You left a tear in the dust
But you never said goodbye
And it's a story of a
Roller coaster town
Well you can touch the top of the sky
But then you're gonna come down, down
Oo, you try to run away
In a one way town
Put your eye to the sky
Plant your feet into the ground
You found a world
A place where the light never dies
You left a tear in the dust
But you never said goodbye
Cause we're the other way
In a one way town
You left a tear in the dust
But you never settled down
Another world
Bright as the sun in your eyes
You left a tear in the dust
Run away, goodbye

Queen 
Torn apart
Begging the forgiveness of your heart
No words can provide
Ours is a deeper truth inside
You called me out
Now all the tides are turning us to doubt
I'm dreaming
I'm drowning
I'm wide awake
Breathing in and breathing out
The beast within the priest without
A lonely voice
And I need to make it over the wall tonight, my love
Blown away
Blinded in the brightness of our day
No lens can provide
Ours is a vision deep inside
Still you call me out
Now the tides are turning us to doubt
I'm dreaming
I'm drowning
I'm wide awake
Breathing in and breathing out
The beast within the priest without
A lonely voice
And I need to make it over the wall tonight, my love
In the mirror glass
Watch the world drift past too fast
And deep inside
You know I'd die
The perfect love
The meaning of the poem is true
It imitates your life
The wind blows over the wall tonight, my love
I'm dreaming
I'm drowning
I'm wide awake
Breathing in and breathing out
The beast within the priest without
A lonely voice
And I need to make it over the wall tonight, my love
I'm dreaming
I'm drowning
I'm wide awake
Breathing in and breathing out
The beast within the priest without
A lonely voice
And I need to make it over the wall tonight, my love

Soul To Sell 
Do you think we're fools?
We know it won't be long
'Til you drill a well
And fall straight through the roof of Hell
And they lock you in a prison cell
And leave the tale for you to tell
You got no more soul to sell
But oh well, that's life
So carve on with your wicked knife
You're so strong, you're so precise
One day you'll learn to take your own advice
And make your home in a prison cell
And leave the tale for me to tell
You got no more soul to sell
And any place you place the blame
The water tastes the same
The sunlight hurts your eyes
It's no surprise
And anyone you chance to meet
A stranger on the street
They're bound to wonder why you run so dry
You drink the tears from their eyes
Do you think we're fools?
We know it won't be long
'Til you drill a well
And fall straight through the roof of Hell
And they lock you in a prison cell
And leave the tale for me to tell
You got no more soul to sell

Trust 
Gentlemen, how'd you get up there?
How you gonna get down?
Sweeping all the search lights above
Over the ground
And I shudder to think
That this is the catastrophe
That fate has in mind
And now buried are the feelings still alive
That you'll never find
They stopped digging for you long ago
My sacred soul, it won't be long
Boderline, and I cannot keep still
Your enemies have trained you
To wear a smile as you kill
And now buried alive
You can't deny
That worst of all
The joke was on you
Now you're scratching out a silent goodbye
With just a candle in a coffin and
They stopped digging for you long ago
My sacred soul, it won't be long
Look into my eyes
At the price I pay
Watch them fade away
Still the beat goes on
They stopped digging for you long ago
My sacred soul, it won't be long
Look into my eyes
At the price I pay
Watch them fade away
Still the beat goes on
The price I pay
The price I pay
The price I pay

Wake Pig 
I was dreaming of this place
Where the earth and sky did blaze
And everywhere I'd run
The fire so high in the sky
Couldn't find the sun
Wake up, soldier
There's no dreams
Left in the dark
Save them
Save yourself
To the last breath
Never forget you could be over
Now my heart and mind are one
I look down at the blood on the ground
Tell me what I've done
And everywhere I see
The fire so high in the sky
Now we can't get free
Wake up, soldier
There's no dreams
Left in the dark
God has called you home
To the last day
Ever the flame levers the spark
Beyond the static screen
The monster wields a dream
He knows he can't be seen
Behind the mask
Shadows seem to multiply
In the space where they'll never find time
For all across the universe
The uninvited guest
It's like an...
Wake up, soldier
There's no dreams
Left in the dark
Save them
Save yourself
To the last breath
Never forget you could be over
You could be over
What if nothing is something that you could be?
You could be over
You could be over
What if nothing is something that you could be?
You could be over

Unique 
Chorus:
No-one know wha mekes me, me,
Who I am,
What I can be.
No-one knows my secret dreams,
My needs and hopes,
My fears and screams.
I am unique - just like everyone else .
No-one really knows me,
No-one ever will,
I'm just sitting on the fence,
and time is standing sill.
My life is a facade,
I cannot lt you in,
Icannot spak my mind,
Let out whats within.
Chorus
I've climed up too far,
On a cliff way too tall,
Icannot reach your hand,
For fear that I may fall.
The human rac is running,
But I've been let behind,
I feel lost in he dark,
But eally I'm just blind
Chorus.
P.S - please email me if you like this song - i have loads more.

VERSE 1
And as the day begins to rise
give a day for the life, liberty, trust in the american way
I was taken by surprise
To see the gate close tightly 
step in line was all I heard 'em say
And as the day begins to lay
across the land like a blind kid playing life as if it were a game
I tried walking towards the light
With my fist in the air, I turned my head and lost the fight
CHORUS
And there's nothing left for me down here
So why can't I just fly
Away from all this pain and fear
among the broken lights
VERSE 2
Time will surely take it's toll
wrinkled skin, grey hair, and turn all of you young to old
I can't change my life i've tried
and with this i'll never be a star in the sky

And when I'm walking out the shadows
help me free my mind

It's Over 
So wake me up from this nightmare
I've been dreaming of 
For so long
It's burned a hole in my head
So large a fist can fit through it
It's my death, for now
ohhh, Right!
So build me up so you can tear me down
Like a broken truck my wheels just ain't moving round
So set me free, let me go and be on my own
Sleep cautiously, for now
I never wanted to play your game
I'm not quite sure though if you feel the same
ohhh, Right!
Your hold on me too strong to break away from
I feel too weak, too weak too stand and run
but I can't see with the fog in front of my eyes
Step carefully, for now
And when it's time to be one
We'll meet up somewhere knowing
Everyday you bring me, down
I try to run but keep falling, down
It's my time, my time to move from this place
Out of line moving into all my space
but now I see everything you do holds me down
I am free, for now
And when it's all said and done
We've seen some times yeah we've had some fun
And though the good shadows bad
You're still the worst thing I've ever had!
It's over(8x)
Everyday I'm breaking, down
I try to run but keep falling, down
I got bad news but I got my, way
Save your shit for a rainy

Age Of Madness 
Tension... like wire... on schizophren street
A man like fire... keeping it discreet
Age of madness... closing into view
Corruption of the dearest... ache the bones inside you
Feel like you're being used
The cloning of the all abused
A new addition to the rest of them
In the age of madness
Closing in on you
Scared of the silence... I am the meaningless
Scared of the violence... I am invertebrate
Feel like you're being used
The cloning of the all abused
A new addition to the rest of them
In the age of madness
Closing in on you
So cry like the rain... to lose the pain of a lifetime
That takes you years to find... with holes left in your mind
To let the loser out... try to start again
Start again... start again... With no-one to blame but yourself
Age of madness... you're not wrong, you're just outnumbered
Age of madness... seasons in the ever under
Feel like you're being used
The cloning of the all abused
A new addition to the rest of them
Feel like you're being used
Looking sussed, but you're confused
The new addition to the rest of them
In the age of madness

Alright Ma 
You were the bright young thing till you took a little sting of Victorian
Then it spread like a slick, made your frozen heart tick, so you passed it on
But I'm alright ma

So I kick around town see who's up and who's down
I hear you're trapped again
And you're straight on the bends
But you'd bend to be straight
Cos you're your only friend
But I'm Alright Ma
I'm Alright Ma
I'm Alright Ma
Turn on the TV, and what do you know?
Thank God, the new god, remote control
Guess you had it sussed out cos you filled me in when I was young as semen
You say your world's gone cold, I'm stood here breaking the mould
I get this feeling..
That I'm alright ma
I'm alright ma
I'm alright ma
Dad swears and mum don't care cos she knows
No-one hears her when her eyes are closed
Did you get what you want
Is your television keeping you happy?
Guess you had it sussed out cos you filled me in when I was young as semen
You say your world's gone cold, I'm stood here breaking the mould

Back To The City 
Look at me, I'm a superstar, a hiroshima... off my cloud
Abolishing the honouries
Yours is mine to take when it takes me
A passenger with no point of view
How can I come to please you?
So hold it up with a high esteem
But there's something... missing
Didn't love it... didn't hate it, rose above it...
With everyone bound to never come down
Please switch me off so that I can see
What is wrong with me
Got my back to the city, I'm
One in three an emergency
I got all I need
With my back to the city, I'm gone
Weightless in a sonic dream
Where a voice just isn't what it screams
I'm just a stain on a memory of a body I don't know
Staying up with the satellites
And we'll burn 'til night on the late show
Born loose, now I'm so uptight
I'll get back to you my friend, my foe
Didn't love it... didn't hate it, rose above it...
With everyone bound to never come down
Please switch me off so that I can see
What is wrong with me
Got my back to the city, I'm
One in three an emergency
I got all I need
With my back to the city, I'm gone
We should be so young, so free, so what
How d'you sleep if you just stand in line?
So let me go round, let me go round
Let me go round, let me go round
Didn't love it... didn't hate it, rose above it...

Beautiful Day 
Things you forget to say
Will haunt you
Down here a million days
I know you'll get me through
You don't need to stay
Because I'll never be alone
Do you cry anymore?
You're in the never-ending
Bitter and condescending blue
I just wanna be by you
And everything will turn to blue
The dream is fallacy come true
Just wanna spend some time with you
On a beautiful day...
Seeing the morning in
Forget to
Worry about the things
That hurt you
You'll becoming dependent now
Is it cold where you are too?
Freeze no more
You're in the never-ending
Bitter and condescending blue
I just wanna be by you
And everything will turn to blue
The dream is a fallacy come true
Just wanna spend some time with you
On a beautiful day...
We got it so throw it away
Cos we will be as lucky as the
Last time, child
The habits don't blow it away
We are on the other side
You know you're
Talking about the old times
Walking down an open road
But failing to disguise
Revealing the signs
Nothing you can do will change me
It's a beautiful day...

Remember me?
I'm here where I have always been
They put me in
And make me feel so I'll at ease
(And I will not go down)
I know there's more than this to see
Make no sound
Wired on your bored analogies
They say you gotta try
They ask, you don't know why
They wake up in disguise and
Feed you, drain you, bleed you, fuck you
I wanna be myself
I'm gonna be myself
I wanna be myself
Until I die
The guard goes up
Pretence the order of the day
My head is gone
Don't think I had it anyway
(And I will not go down)
Trash in your fallen fantasy
I stud my crown
This is my technicality
They say you gotta try
They ask, you don't know why
They wake up in disguise and
Feed you, drain you, bleed you, fuck you

You get so used to falling over
Start learning how to crawl
Before you fall right off
Sometimes I feel... like I'll chase my life away
No difference here... just the promise of another day
Do you wanna get high?
Do you wanna bail out?
Vanish into nothing... to shout about
Calling to the outside
Calling to be heard
Calling to the outside
Trust is a dirty word
All looking at different things
All looking at different ways to
Don't wanna get so close
But no-one's running away
Do you wanna get high?
Do you wanna bail out?
Vanish into nothing... to shout about
Calling to the outside
Calling to be heard
Calling to the outside

And did you ever think that you just might be wrong sometimes
I got a universe of soul
So many things that you don't wanna know

At a million miles an hour
It'll knock you off your tower
Be the poison in your flower

Cancel the exhibition
Fade in the warning signs
Feel like I gave it all
But I no longer have the will to try
I wanna live without the guilt
Didn't even see the walls were built
I've been here before but this time I won't be staying
At a million miles an hour

Been walking round like a space cadet
With a bubble around my head
I don't remember the things you taught me
I just remember the things you said
Are lies that paralyse
Don't step on me man look at your own skies
Lies add no surprise
I get the feeling that it's me and the sunrise
A pointless phone call, imminent panic
I got the main ball, but I don't want it
Pull down the blind I think I'm in it again
Why don't we ever get the signals we send?
And when the threads are false and warn
I just want to be reborn
I think I'm getting the pains again
I think I've lost all my so called friends
Are lies that paralyse
Don't step on me man look at your own skies
Lies add no surprise
I get the feeling that it's me and the sunrise
Been walking around like a space cadet
With a bubble around my head
I don't remember the things you taught me
I just remember the things you said
Are lies that paralyse
Don't step on me man look at your own skies
Lies add no surprise
I get the feeling that it's me and the sunrise
Lies that paralyse
Don't step on me man look at your own skies
Lies add no surprise
I get the feeling that it's me and the sunrise.

Pirouette 
She don't know what to say
She don't know what to do
She's up in arms today.. shining on you
Not at liberty to
As we are only passing through
You don't get the outside line
Only waste your precious time
From out of the air it seems
She fell into your dreams
She could turn your day to night
Been chasing the pirouette
Though she doesn't know it yet
Spin me out one more time (follow you down)
What are we gonna do? About the endless days? I know I'm overdue
I think she's gonna stay
Attracted by you
And yes I would have liked you to
You don't get the outside line
Only waste your precious time
From out of the air it seems
She fell into your dreams
She could turn your day to night
Been chasing the pirouette
Though she doesn't know it yet
Spin me out one more time
The streets are sheets of plasticine and we're..
All liars in a dream
So close your eyes to anything you're right... so right
Don't let them take you alive
Just waste your precious time
From out of the air it seems
She fell into your dreams
She could turn your day to night
Been chasing the pirouette
Though she doesn't know it yet
Spin me out one more time

Pure 
When the one thing in your life comes crashin'
What you gonna do?
When naievety was my energy
Like power was you tool
And you broke me down like diamonds
Turned my blood to rust
Abuser of an innocence
Your real love was lust
Cos you had to be something
Be someone
And play, play, play, play games with heads
Got the chill when you passed go
All you wanted was control
You had me like a remote
Be someone
Cos you had to be something
And here are the terms on which you'll live:
I'll hate who I want, and I'll give when I give
And just because you're insecure
Doesn't mean you couldn't be pure
Doesn't mean you couldn't be pure
One lie for one lie
And you let it go so soon
And now I bet you're happy
Always at the back of my mind
Be someone
You had to be something
And here are the terms on which you'll live:
I'll hate who I want, and I'll give when I give
And just because you're insecure
Doesn't mean you couldn't be pureDoesn't mean you couldn't be pure
Doesn't mean you couldn't be pure

So smile, the sixty mile smile
Headlight apocalypse
Sunrise, just for a while
Inject a drip
Sixty mile smile (on and on and on and on)
Sixty mile smile (on and on and on and on)
Appetites of the soul
In teeth of a snake
Filling up any hole
You're all afraid
To smile the sixty mile smile
I get so tired of being down
We fall in elegant style
Without a sound
I'm back in from the cold
Something you can't fake
True feelings on parole
We're all afraid
Sixty mile smile (on and on and on and on)
Sixty mile smile (on and on and on and on)
Appetites of the soul
In teeth of a snake
In a crowd, you're all alone
You're all afraid

To smile the sixty mile smile
To smile the sixty mile smile
So smile the sixty mile smile (on and on and on and on)

Song On The Radio 
So change the ninety-nine
Into a hundred
A crack in your grand design
Coming up under
And take you high over
Your brightest nova
Until we come again...
Nothing can stop us
I see you run again... away and
High over...your brightest nova
A transmission to be heard
'til the frequency's inbred
So cry no tears
Show no fears
This is the song on your radio
This is the picture on your screen
This is the song on your radio
So get it alive
Cos I don't know what I'm supposed to feel...
Us children of the brave
Lost in the new world
Getting ready for the confrontation
The aggravation
This is the song on your radio
This is the picture on your screen
This is the song on your radio
So get it alive

No... don't get to close

So... beautiful, you're ugly

In my head - I can get so far away
The colours here are bright, not black or grey
And my imaginary friends - we always get our way
The madness never ends, and I just wanna stay
But then
I wake
To seek
Escape
Escape.. again
Hey, hey, hey - this day has gone to fast
With people like you, make it seem like it's the last
Selfish, helpless and not a part of me
You'll never make me what I don't wanna be
Your words
Spread round
The same
Dead town
Dead town.. and streets
You'll never see what I believe
Till it's sunny in England.. yeah, yeah
And in

You soak

And grieve.. and all you do is grieve
You'll never see what I believe
Till it's sunny in England.. yeah, yeah
Sometimes I lose this memory
Ain't it good to be in England

So long in silence
But it took so long
To belong
I'm bored out of my tiny mind
If this is all it is
Then you're gone to heaven
Race you to the high

I never knew of
This Is My Time
This Is My Time
Wasn't meant to be
So down underground
Now I see the sun
And I feel like something good is gonna happen
It could always be
That you're there
And I'm here
We'll play around
And then
Sleep until the nightime comes
This Is My Time
This Is My Time
You wanna high
You wanna fly
Your feet are in the underground
And different is indifference and
Nobody's going to hear you boy
But scream on dream on

Love we sharing in so many ways
I see your smiling face
Something that my mind can't erase
I often wonder why
You had to leave without a goodbye
I would've been right there
I'll always be the one who cares

Baby i can't get over you
All I want is to be with you
Baby I can't let go of you
Can't we try just one more time
Just one more time
Ooh, baby

Another lonely night
Only you can make it right
I wanna be with you
This time I know that we can make it through
I just wanna say
That I will love you in every way
This time I will be true
There's no one I'd rather be with than you
[Chorus]
I wonder where you are
If you're near or if you are far away
Do I ever cross your mind
It doesn't have to be this way

All i want is to hold you
To kiss you
To look into your eyes just one more time

'cause you left me standing out in the rain
you left me with so much pain
it's never gonna be the same
without you in my life
'cause you left me standing out in the rain
i ran across an old picture of you
it brought back the things that are so good in my life
one more chance
at your heart

can you please
stop this rain
from falling down

Can anyone tell what I've done

I miss the colours of the world 
Can anyone tell where I am 
'Cause now again I've found myself 
So far down, away from the sun

I'm so far down, away from the sun again 
Away from the sun again 
I'm over this 
I'm tired of living in the dark 
Can anyone see me down here

There's nothing left to lift me up 
Back into the world I know
And now again I've found myself 
So far down, away from the sun

That shines to light the way for me 
To find my way back into the arms 
That care about the ones like me

Behind those eyes you lie
And theres nothing I can say
Cause im never gonna change your mind
Behind those eyes you hide
As you turned to walk away
I saw another look in your eye
And even though it hurt like it did
I couldn't let this be your goodbye.
You say that you're sorry
And you say now that it hurts you the same
Is there something here to believe
Or is it just another part of the game?
Theres something I cant see

Be Like That 
He spends his nights in California, {He spent his whole life being to young,}
Watching the stars on the big screen, {To live the life that's in his dreams,}
Then he lies awake and he wonders, {At night he lies awake and he wonders,}
Why can't that be me
Cause in his life he is filled
With all these good intentions
He's left a lot of things 
He'd rather not mention right now
But just before he says goodnight, 
He looks up with a little smile at me,
And he says,
If I could be like that,
I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes
If I could be like that,
what would I do,
What would I do
Now and dreams we run
She spends her days up in the north park,
Watching the people as they pass
And all she wants is just
A little piece of this dream, 
Is that too much to ask
With a safe home, and a warm bed, 
On a quiet little street
All she wants is just that something to
Hold onto, that's all she needs
Yeah!
If I could be like that,
I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes
If I could be like that, what would I do,
What would I do
I'm falling into this, dreams,
We run away
If I could be like that,
I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes
If I could be like that, what would I do,
What would I do
If I could be like that,
I would give anything
Just to live one day, in those shoes
If I could be like that, what would I do,

If I could be like that,

Just to live one day, in those shoes
If I could be like that, what would I do,

I wish that I could move but I'm exhausted and nobody understands (how I feel)

When I get suffocated, save me
Now I'm going through changes, changes

Everything you say, every word of it, cuts me to the bone

Beyond the boundaries of your city's lights,
Stand the heroes waiting for your cries.
So many times you did not bring this on yourself,
When that moment finally comes,
I'll be there to help.
On that day when you need your brothers and sisters to care,
I'll be right here.
Citizen soldiers holding the light for the ones that we guide from the dark of despair.
Standing on guard for the ones that we sheltered,
We'll always be ready because we will always be there.
When there are people crying in the streets,
When they're starving for a meal to eat,
When they simply need a place to make their beds,
Right here underneath my wing,
You can rest your head.
On that day when you need your brothers and sisters to care,
I'll be right here!
Citizen soldiers holding the light for the ones that we guide from the dark of despair.
Standing on guard for the ones that we sheltered,
We'll always be ready because we will always be there...
There... there... there...
Hope and pray that you'll never need me,
But rest assured I will not let you down.
I'll walk beside you but you may not see me,
The strongest among you may not wear a crown.
On that day when you need your brothers and sisters to care,
I'll be right here!
On that day when you don't have the strength for the burden you bear,
I'll be right here!

You stand before me
Now we stare eye to eye
Before another second clicks away, one of us will die
You reach for your metal as I reach for mine
The sound of bullets flying through the air is followed by a cry
And there cryin'
What will we do, what will we say when it's the end of this game that we play
Will we crumble into the dust, my friend
Or will we start this game over again
The young man lies alone but fastened into the ground
The sound of fleeing feet and the cryin' eye will be his last sound
But do we gain from all this?
Now, was it worth a life? no
We throw all of our hopes away
And set our dreams aside
Now we're cryin'
What will we do, what will we say when it's the end of this game that we play
Will we crumble into the dust, my friend
or will we start this game over again
It's coming back to me 
It's coming back to me

Down Poison 
I've dreamed about this,
Sixteen days away
Now you're here,
And my head lays besides your body, 
Pillowed under mine
You were poison, 
Spinning round my mind
Welcome to my world, she said 
Do you feel alive, she said
It's all a bad dream, 
Spinning in your lonely head,
Welcome to my world, 
She said, separated world,
She said, separated
Down poison
Down poison
Body withered, body died
Time to take away this life
Bad enough to die from one, 
Not to mention
Four or five
Welcome to my world
She said, do you feel alive she said
It's all a bad dream,
Spinning in your lonely head
Welcome to my world she said
Separated world, she stayed separated
Down poison, down poison
Down poison, down

Welcome to my world she said, do

It's all a bad dream,
Spinning in your lonely head
Welcome to my world she said,
Separated world, she stayed separated
Down poison, down poison
Down poison, down.

Duck And Run 
Songwriters:
 Roberts, Matt; Harrell, Todd; Arnold, Brad; Henderson, Chris;
To this world I'm unimportant
Just because I have nothing to give
So you call this your free country
Tell me why it cost so much to live
Tell me why
This world can turn me down?
But I won't turn away, oh no
And I won't turn around
All my work and endless measures
Never seem to get me very far
Walk a mile just to move an inch
Now even though I'm trying so damn hard
I'm trying so hard
This world can turn me down but I won't turn away
And I won't duck and run 'cause I'm not built that way
When everything is gone there's nothing there to fear
This world cannot bring me down, no 'cause I am already here, oh no
I'm already here, down on my knees
I'm already here, oh no, I'm already here
I must have told you a thousand times
I'm not running away
I won't duck and run
I won't duck and run
I won't duck and run
No, no, no pass away
This world can turn me down but I won't turn away
And I won't duck and run, 'cause I'm not built that way
When everything is gone there's nothing there to fear
This world cannot bring me down no, 'cause I'm already here
This world can turn me down but I won't turn away
And I won't duck and run 'cause I'm not built that way
When everything is gone there's nothing there to fear
This world cannot bring me down, no 'cause I'm already here

Father's Son 
Songwriters:
 Roberts, Matt; Harrell, Todd; Arnold, Brad; Henderson, Chris;
In the glare of a neon sign, she laid her body down
The damned walked in beside her and he laid his money down
He said don't try to scream now but I want this one to hurt
And tonight my pretty one I'm gonna get my money's worth
He said they never listened, she said they'd never understand
That I don't this for pleasure, I just do it cause I can
I swear I didn't want to and I swear I didn't know
That things like this could happen to a 17-year old
And I've bundled up all of these fears inside
And I've bottled up all of this pain
And no one or nothing can take this away
But I won't let it happen again
Never again
In the haze of a smoky room
He chokes that bottle down
It's been a month since her saw her face
Underneath the blood stained gown
And he thinks about that little girl
And the one he has at home
And wonders what if that was my little girl
Walkin' down that road alone
And I've bundled up all of these fears inside
And I've bottled up all of this pain
And no one or nothing can take this away
But I won't let it happen again
Never again, never again
No
Maybe I'm just crazy or the devil got inside
Either way my soul is gone, and I'll end this all night
The one hand throws the whiskey, and the other throws the gun
As he cries out to the heavens, I am not my father's son
And I've bundled up all of these fears inside
And I've bottled up all of this pain
And no one or nothing can take this away
But I won't let it happen again
Never again, never again
No

Give It To Me 
It feels like something got in the way
And maybe i had something to do with it
There's not much that i can say
But there sure is something i've got to prove to you
I told you, that i'd try
And you said that i lie
Like i have something to sell
Come on wait a minute
You think I've been in this
For a little while 
But now come on baby, please
I've been on my knees for a long time
So come on, give it to me
Just give it to me
There's always something I wanna say
But the words won't never come out the way I want
Maybe i see another way
Or maybe I just see somethin you don't
These stories that you tell
Now I know them a little too well
You think I'll take what I want
But oh no
Come on wait a minute
You think I've been in this
For a little while 
But now come on baby, please
I've been on my knees for a long time
Come on, give it to me
One more wrong won't make it right
I don't wanna fight no more
I'm tired of sayin' please
This is all I need
So give me just a little bit
A little bit more
Oh, give me just a little bit more
Come on wait a minute
You think I've been in this
For a little while
But now come on baby, please
I've been on my knees for a long time
Come on wait a minute
You think I've been in this
For a little while 
But now come on baby, please
I've been on my knees for a long time
Come on, give it to me
One more wrong will make it right
I don't wanna fight no more
I'm tired of sayin' please
This is all I need
So give me just a little bit
A little bit more
Oh, give me just a little bit more
Give me just a little bit more

Here By Me 
I hope you're doing fine out there without me
Cause I'm not doing so good without you
The things I thought you'd never know about me
Were the things I guess you always understood
So how could I have been so blind for all these years?
Guess I only see the truth through all this fear,
And living without you
And everything I have in this world
And all that I'll ever be
It could all fall down around me.
Just as long as I have you,
Right here by me.
I can't take another day without you
Cause baby, I could never make it on my own
I've been waiting so long, just to hold you
And to be back in your arms where I belong
Sorry I can't always find the words to say
But everything I've ever known gets swept away
Inside of your love
And everything I have in this world
And all that I'll ever be
It could all fall down around me.
Just as long as I have you,
Right here by me.
As the days grow long I see
That time is standing still for me
When you're not here
Sorry I can't always find the words to say
Everything I've ever known gets swept away
Inside of your love
And everything I have in this world
And all that I'll ever be
It could all fall down around me.
Just as long as I have you,

Here Without You 
A hundred days have made me older
Since the last time that I saw your pretty face
A thousand lies have made me colder
And I don't think I can look at this the same
But all the miles that separate
Disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face
I'm here without you baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you baby
And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight it's only you and me, yeah
The miles just keep rollin'
As the people leave their way to say hello
I've heard this life is overrated
But I hope that it gets better as we go, oh yeah yeah
I'm here without you baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you baby
And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you baby
But you're still with me in my dreams
And tonight girl it's only you and me
Everything I know and anywhere I go
It gets hard but it won't take away my love
And when the last one falls, when it's all said and done
It gets hard but it won't take away my love, whoa
I'm here without you baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you baby
And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you baby
But you're still with me in my dreams

I Feel You 
They gave me a life that's not so easy to live
And then they sent me on my way
I left my love and forgot my dreams
I lost them along the way
Those little things you say
When words mean so much
You never back down
And they all shy away
You always listen to me
And what do I get to get me through these sleepless nights?
And what do I have to hold when no one's there to hold me tight
And what do I see? the only thing that gets me through this is what I feel and I feel you
And this ain't no bed of nails
But there not roses just the same 
Got this road sure can be long
Another endless day, another seven hundred miles that'll take me further from my home
Those little things you say
When words mean so much
You never back down
And they all shy away
You always listen to me
And what do I get to get me through these sleepless nights
And what do I have to hold when no one's there to hold me tight
And what do I see the only thing that gets me through this is what I feel and I feel you
I know what you're going through now
Believe me I live this
And what do I care to get me through these sleepless nights
And what do I have to hold when no one's there to hold me tight
And what do I see the only thing that gets me through this is what I feel and I feel you

Look what you did
Is this who you wanted me to be?
Well it's not me
Look what you did
Is this how you wanted it to be?

Was meant for me
Forget about the trip that you've been on
Or so it seems
Nevermind the lies that you told, my tears

You made me doubt all of this

It's Not My Time 
Looking back at the beginning of this
And how life was
Just you and me and love and all of our friends
Living life like an ocean
But now the current's only pulling me down
It's getting harder to breathe
It won't be too long and I'll be going under
Can you save me from this?
'Cause it's not my time, I'm not going
There's a fear in me and it's not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know, ooh, but I won't go
I look ahead to all the plans that we made
And the dreams that we had
I'm in a world that tries to take them away
Oh, but I'm taking them back
'Cause all this time I've just been too blind to understand
What should matter to me
My friend, this life we live, it's not what we have
It's what we believe in
It's not my time, I'm not going
There's a fear in me, it's not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
But it's not my time, I'm not going
There's a will in me and now I know that
This could be the end of me
And everything I know, ooh, but I won't go!
I won't go!
There might be more than you believe
(There might be more than you believe)
And there might be more than you can see
But it's not my time, I'm not going
There's a fear in me, it's not showing
This could be the end of me
And everything I know
But it's not my time, I'm not going
There's a will in me and now it's gonna show
This could be the end of me

There might be more than you believe

It's The Only One You've Got 
How do you know where
you're going when you
don't know where you've
been? You hide the shame
that you're not showing.
And you won't let anyone
in. A crowded street can
be a quiet place when
you're walking alone.
And now you think that
you're the only one who
doesn't have to try. 
Then you won't have to fail.
If you're afraid to fly,
then I guess you never will.
Chorus:
You hide behind your
walls of maybe nevers.
Forgetting that there's
something more than just
knowing better. Your 
mistakes do not define
you now, they tell you
who you're not. You've got
to live this life you're 
given like it's the only
one you've got.
Memories have left you
broken and the scars have
never healed. The emptiness
in you is growing, there's
so little left to fill.
You're scared to look back
on the days before, but too
tired to move on. And now you
think that you're the only one
who doesn't have to try. Then
you won't have to fail.
If you're afraid to fly,
then I guess you never will.
(Chorus)
Ooh.And what would it take
to get you to say that I'll
try?And what would you say
if this was the last day of
your life?
(Chorus x2)

Kryptonite 
Well I took a walk around the world to ease my troubled mind
I left my body lying somewhere in the sands of time
But I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
I feel there is nothing I can do, yeah
I watched the world float to the dark side of the moon
After all I knew it had to be something to do with you
I really don't mind what happens now and then
As long as you'll be my friend at the end
And if I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite
You call me strong, you call me weak
But still your secrets I will keep
You took for granted all the times
I never let you down
You stumbled in and bumped your head
If not for me then you'd be dead
I picked you up and put you back on solid ground
If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there holding my hand
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might
Kryptonite
If I go crazy then will you still call me Superman?
If I'm alive and well, will you be there holding my hand?
I'll keep you by my side with my superhuman might

Let Me Be Myself 
I guess i just got lost being someone else, 
I tried to kill the pain 
But nothing ever helped 
I left myself behind 
Somewhere along the way 
Hoping to come back around 
and find myself some day
Lately I'm so tired of waiting for you 
To say that it's OK, tell me please 
Would you one time, 
Let Me Be Myself 
So i can shine, 
with my own light 
Let Me Be Myself
Would you Let Me Be Myself 
Coz I'll never find my heart 
Behind someone else 
I'll never see the light of day 
Living in this cell 
It's time to make my way 
Into the world i knew 
And take back all of these times 
That I gave in to you 
Lately I'm so tired of waiting for you 
To say that it's OK, tell me please 
Would you one time,

Was to let me be me..

One more kiss could be the best thing
But one more lie could be the worst
And all these thoughts are never resting
And you're not something I deserve
In my head there's only you now
This world falls on me
In this world there's real and make believe
And this seems real to me

You love me but you don't know who I am
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand
And you love me but you don't know who I am
So let me go
Let me go
I dream ahead to what I hope for
And I turn my back on loving you
How can this love be a good thing
When I know what I'm goin through
In my head there's only you now
This world falls on me
In this world there's real and make believe
And this seems real to me

I can't escape these things inside I know
I knowww..

You will be the only one who knows
Who knows

You love me but you don't know who I am
I'm torn between this life I lead and where I stand

Never Will I Break 
Lay me down
Wash this blood off my hands for me while I cry out
Don't let me die before I go to sleep
And I can't keep going

At least a million times I've fallen 
But never will I break

They could hold me in and hold me back today
Oh but tomorrow's new and I'll walk right out and walk right over you
If you hear me screaming
Please don't let me fall again

At least a million times I've fallen 
But never will I break
My time is on its way
I'll fall but I won't break
This road I walk is paved with broken promises I've made
At least a million times I've fallen 
But never will I break
This road I walk is paved with broken promises I've made
At least a million times I've fallen 
But never will I break

Not Enough 
Seven days underpaid
Gotta give it up
Got no time for this life that
I'm livin up
Shackled down, kicked around, 
Now slave to the grind
Need some time for myself
I'll give you anything that you want me to
But I don't have the time so
I'll get up with you
But if you don't understand man
You've got to believe
There is too much of you but
There is not enough of me
There is not enough of me
Same old song world moves on
while I'm still in bed
Meet tomorrow today just to get ahead
Jump the gun on the run,
I'm the only one
Who thinks I'm fallin behind?
I'll give you anything that
You want me to
But I don't have the time
So I'll get up with you
But if don't understand
Man you've got to believe
There is too much of you
But there is not enough of me
There is not enough of me
I'll give you anything 
that you want me to
But I don't have the time so I'll
Get up with you
But I don't understand man
You've got to believe
There is too much of you 
There is too much of me
I'll give you anything that you want me to
But I don't have the time so I'll
Get up with you
But if don't understand man
You've got to believe
There is too much of you 
But there is not enough of me
There is not enough of me

What happens to a man when he spills his heart over a page
And he watches words float away then
His feelings lie on a page alone
There waiting for someone who cares to read them
To open their eyes to see them
To see if they can make his thoughts their own
To find out that maybe your life's not perfect
Maybe it's not worth what he gives away
You can see that this broken soul is bleeding
So you can see your feelings inside yourself
And wonder through my heart
Letting you see through me now only consumes me
Forget your pain and watch me fall apart
What happens to a soul when he's trapped inside his emotions
And all of these words he's spoken
They bind him to the life he's left behind
And every new step he takes
He knows that he might not make it
To all of these dreams that he has yet to find
Maybe your life's not perfect
Or maybe it's not worth what he gives away
You can see that this broken soul is bleeding
So you can see your feelings inside yourself
And wonder through my heart
Letting you see through me now only consumes me
Forget your pain and watch me fall apart
As I fall apart
You can see that this broken soul is bleeding
So you can see your feelings inside yourself
And wonder through my heart
Letting you see through me now only consumes me
Forget your pain and watch me fall apart
As I fall apart

Right Where I Belong 
There's a difference in spending time with me
And killing time while I'm there
On too many people and too many things
And it makes me feel like hell
You have gone as I can see
And all of this she says to me
[Chorus]
Theres too many questions
And too many strings
And they won't keep their self tied
On a roller coaster ride
It Feels like I'm lying next to a ghost at night
I don't know why I gave you my heart
Cause sometimes it feels so wrong
But despite of all this weather
I know why we are together
And I swear right now
I'm right where I belong
I know I get a little bit crazy
But I never done you no wrong
Well I get distracted and carried away
And it's been this way too long
But I don't know what you need from me
Cause all I know is what I can see
[Chorus]
I don't know why I gave you my heart
Cause sometimes it feels so wrong
But despite of all this weather
I know why we are together
And I swear right now
I'm right where I belong
I'm right where I belong
Go on, Play it for me Son
[Chorus]
I don't know why I gave you my heart
Cause sometimes it feels so wrong
But despite of all this weather
I know why we are together
And I swear right now
I'm right where I belong

Running Out Of Days 
There's too much work and Im spent
There's too much pressure and I'm bent
I got no time to move ahead
Have you heard one thing that I've said
And all these little things in life they all create this haze
There's too many things to get done, and Im running out of days
And I can't last here for so long
I feel this current it's so strong
It gets me further down the line
It gets me closer to the light
And all these little things in life they all create this haze
There's too many things to get done, and Im running out of days
All these little things in life they all create this haze
There's too many things to get done, and Im running out of days
Will all these little things in life they all create this haze
And now I'm running out of time I cant see through this haze
My friend tell me why it has to be this way
There's too many things to get done, and Im running out of days

Sarah Yellin' 
She says, I got something to say
She knows what she says will change everything
She's laid through so many sleepless nights
She's crying, shes crying, shes crying
Mother. That man took my soul away
Father. How could you ever treat me this way?
Brother. Don't ever let him do this again
This time it's over Im gonna make it end
Now it's over and the old man is in
Lying on the ground. Bullet in his head
She stood at the foot of the guilty bed last night
She held what could set her free for the rest of her life
She did all that she said that she planned to do
She's through, shes through, shes through, yeah
Mother. That man took my soul away
Father. How could you ever treat me this way
Brother. Don't ever let him do this again
This time it's over Im gonna make it end
Now it's over, the old man is dead
Lying on the ground. Bullet in his head
There's a bullet in your head
I kept fallin' down, look who's fallin' now
I kept cryin' out, look who's cryin' now
I kept fallin' down, look who's fallin' now...
I'm ready, Im ready, Im ready
Now it's over, this is what she said
He's lyin' on the ground. Bullet in his head.

Smack 
Rubber headed motor junky, 
Run me down and try to stomp me
Throw my life away, and I'll be worthless
Just like you
Somewhere now a baby's crying, 
Down the road his mother's dying
Shot a line and blew her mind 
And now she's turning blue
Don't you throw your life away, 
Just wait until another day
Don't you throw your life away, 
Cause baby I can feel it
Don't you ever compromise it, 
Don't you even realize it
Don't throw your life away, 
Cause baby I can feel it, now
Trip and fall,
I'm sure you all can tell me
What is on the wall behind the liquor store 
Where you get smacked up all the time
Perfect little life you wasted, 
Overdosed and that death you tasted
Scared you back into yourself, and now
You walk the line
Don't you throw your life away, 
Just wait until another day
Don't you throw your life away, 
Cause baby I can feel it
Don't you ever compromise it, 
Don't you even realize it
Don't throw your life away, 
Cause baby I can feel it, now
Life away

So I Need You 
If you could step
into my head, tell
Me would you still know me
If you woke up in my bed,
Tell me then would you hold me
Or would you simply let it lie,
Leaving me to wonder why
I can't get you out of this head
I call mine
And I will say
Oh no I can't let you go,
My little girl
Because you're holding up my world,
So I need you
Your imitation of my walk
And the perfect way you talk
It's just a couple of the million things
That I love about you
So I need you
So I need you
So I need you
So I need you
And if I jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge,
Tell me would you still follow me
And if I made you mad today,
Tell me would you love me tomorrow?
Please
Or would you say that you don't care,
And then leave me standing here
Like the fool who is drowning in despair
And screamin'
Oh no I can't let you go,
My little girl
Because you're holding up my world,
So I need you
Your imitation of my walk
And the perfect way you talk
It's just a couple of the million
Things that I love about you
So I need you
So I need you
So I need you
So I need you
I'm on my own
I'm on my own
I'm on my own
Oh no I can't let you go,
My little girl
Because you're holding up my world,
So I need you
Your imitation of my walk
And the perfect way you talk
It's just a couple of the million things
That I love about you
So I need you
So I need you
So I need you
So I need you!

The Real Life 
I wanted to find somewhere to hide
And I opened up and left those fears inside
And I wanted to be anyone else
Only to find that there was noone there but me
But I woke up to real life
And I realised its not worth running from anymore
When there was nowhere left to hide I found out
That nothings real here but I wont stop now until I find a better part of me
I let those hard days get me down
And all the things I hate got in my way
I could of screamed without a sound
I found myself silenced by those things they say
But I woke up to real life
And I realised its not worth running from anymore
When there was nowhere left to hide I found out
That nothings real here but I wont stop now until I find a better part of me
Thats out there somewhere
And it cant be that far away
Thats where ill find myself
And ill find my way out
Thats where ill find out
But I woke up to real life
And I realised its not worth running from anymore
When there was nowhere left to hide I found out
That nothings real here but I wont stop now until I find a better part of me

The Road I'm On 
She said life's a lot to think about sometimes
When you're living in between the lines
And all the stars they sparkle and shine everyday 
He said life's so hard to move in sometimes
When it feels like I'm towin' the line
And no one even cares to ask me why I feel this way 
I know you feel helpless now and I know you feel alone
That's the same road, the same road that I am on 
He said life's a lot to think about sometimes
When you keep it all between the lines
Of everything I want and I want to find, one of these days 
What you thought was real in life somehow steered you wrong
Now you just keep drivin' tryin' to find out where you belong 
I know you feel helpless now and I know you feel alone
That's the same road, that same road that I am on

Now you just keep drivin' tryin' to find out where you belong

Unsure of yourself
you stand divided now.
Which road will lead you there
Last time, you fell and you hit hard
Your wounds have healed by now
But you still see your scars yeah
But it's not the way it use to be right now
You've come so far, to just let this go my friend, don't go over
The same way you did the last time 
You'll break when you fall
Don't make the same mistakes you did all over 
You've got to believe in yourself, this time...
Live on, live it up today
This life's your cup
So drink it up I say, yeah 
Say it's mine, so give it all up to me now
And walk that line, don't let this go my friend, dont go over.. 
Same way you did the last time 
You'll break when you fall
Don't make the same mistakes you did all over
You've got to believe in yourself, this time

Ticket To Heaven 
I'm walking a wire, feel likes a thousand ways I could fall
To want is to buy, but to live is to die and you can't take it all
When everything is said and done I won't have one thing left
What happened to everything that I ever known
All thay gave me was this ticket to heaven, that ticket to heaven, said to lie in the bed that
you make
Now I'm restless and Im running from everything, Im running from everything, Im afraid its
a little too late
Soft voices lie, innocents die 
Now ain't that a shame 
And all your dreams, and all your money they don't mean a thing
When everything is said and done, you won't have one thing left
What happened to everything that I ever known
All they gave me was this ticket to heaven, that ticket to heaven, said to lie in the bed that
you make
Now I'm restless and Im running from everything, Im running from everything, Im afraid its

It's a little too late

said to lie in the bed that you make
Now I'm restless and Im running from everything, Im running from everything, Im afraid its

All he gave me was this ticket to heaven, that ticket to heaven, said to lie in the bed that

There's another world inside of me that you may never see
There's secrets in this life that I can't hide
Somewhere in this darkness there's a light that I can't find
Maybe it's too far away, maybe I'm just blind
Maybe I'm just blind
So hold me when I'm here, right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared and love me when I'm gone
Everything I am and everything in me
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be
I'll never let you down even if I could
I'd give up everything if only for your good
So hold me when I'm here, right me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared you won't always be there
So love me when I'm gone, love me when I'm gone
When your education x-ray cannot see under my skin
I won't tell you a damn thing that I could not tell my friends
And roaming through this darkness I'm alive but I'm alone
Part of me is fighting this but part of me is gone
So hold me when I'm here, right me when I'm wrong
Hold me when I'm scared and love me when I'm gone
Everything I am and everything in me
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be
I'll never let you down even if I could
I'd give up everything if only for your good
So hold me when I'm here, right me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared, you won't always be there

Hold me when I'm scared and love me when I'm gone
Everything I am and everything in me
Wants to be the one you wanted me to be
I'll never let you down even if I could
I'd give up everything if only for your good
So hold me when I'm here, right me when I'm wrong
You can hold me when I'm scared, you won't always be there

When It's Over 
You must be happy with yourself
Think you're so much better than me
Why do you love to see me fail so much
Coz on that day you crawl back on your knees
[Chorus]
Tell me who will save you
When there's no one else around
And you can't turn to me
Tell me where will you be
When it's over
All this pride you hold inside is gone
Tell me where will you hide
When it's over
And everything you know is said and done
When it's over where will you run
Do your memories hold your dreams
Do they simply seem to have a mind of their own
Tell me what the emptiness brings
And everything you know is everything but gone
[Chorus]
You can't hold your world together now
Everyone sees who you really are
When your castle crumbles at your feet
Don't you run to me
When it's over
And all this pride you hold inside has died
Where will you hide
When it's over
And all this pride you hold inside has died 
Tell me where will you hide
When it's over
And everything you know is said and done
When it's over where will you run

Burning Man 
The rise and fall of my sloppy love
The smatterings, and splatterings
They'll get you
I'm not the one you were thinking of
Maybe you thought I'd call
Instead of crashing down your hall
Hold me down, I wanna find out
You know you will never get what you need
Blue Diamond strike 'em anywhere
First we caffeinate then incinerate
We'll get you
And sparks will fly in the summer air
Did you pull out of your stall
Maybe I'll see you after all
Hold me down, I wanna find out
We say no, cause I live my life like a burning man
Like a burning man, a burning man
Like a burning man
And I won't get enough until my legs are broken
The stars they shine in an empty void
Life is not to fear, life is to enjoy
He'll get you
Oh, Mr. Death catches all someday
Baby I thought you'd call
Or leave a light on in the hall
Hold me down but I'll find out
We say no, cause I live my life like a burning man
Like a burning man, a burning man
Like a burning man
Hold me down, I wanna find out
We say no, cause I live my life like a burning man

Born a joneser
And the cops roll out the radar
And shoot devious grins
Another day begins
I want someone to know me
Maybe tell me who I am
Cause I've faced down my demons
And cried out to a god
A God I've never seen
Lights
And the world darkens around me
Strange friends all surround me
New ideas in my head start to burn
Dropped out of schools cuz of things that I never learned
And the world darkens around me
World drakens around me
I want you to love me
Like you did before you knew me
And i never thought there'd be any help
For somebody like me
A vacancy
Sing
And the world darkens around me
Strange friends all surround me
New ideas in my head start to burn
Trust no one is the one thing that I learned
World darkens around me

Slide off the moon

Deep Inside Of You 
When we met light was shed
Thoughts free flow you said you've got something
Deep inside of you
A wind chime voice sound, sway of your hips round rings true
Echo's deep inside of you
These secret garden beams changed my life so it seems
Fall breeze blows outside, i don't bring stride
My thoughts are warm, and they go deep inside of you
Oh yeah
And I never felt alone
Alright, alone...alone
Till I met you
Friends say I've changed
I don't listen cause I live to be
Deep inside of you
Slide of her dress, shouts in darkness
I'm so alive I'm
Deep inside of you
You said boy make girl feel good
But still...deep inside...STILL!
I've never felt alone
Till I met you
I'm alright on my own
Till I met you
And I'd know what to do if I just knew what's coming
I would change myself if I could
I'd walk with my own people if I could find them,
And I would say that I'm sorry to you,
I'm sorry to you, but I don't want to call you,
But then I want to call you cause I don't want to crush you,
But I feel like crushing you and it's true
I took for granted you were with me,
I breath by your looks and you look right through me
But we were broken and didn't know it
But we were broken and didn't know it
But we were broken and didn't know it
But we were broken and didn't know it
Right...oh, what's right?
Something's gone you withdraw and I'm not strong like before I was
Deep inside of you
I can go nowhere I burn candles and stare at a ghost
Deep inside of you
And some great need in me, starts to bled
I've lost my self there's nothing left, it's all gone
Deep inside of you
Deep inside of you

God Of Wine 
Every thought that I repent
There's another chip you haven't spent
And you're cashing them all in
Where do we begin to get clean again
Can we get clean again
I walk home alone with you
And the mood you're born into
Sometimes you let me in
And I take it on the chin
I can't get clean again
I want to know can we get clean again
The God of Wine comes crashing through
The headlights of a car that took you farther
Than you thought you'd ever want to go
We can't get back again
We can't get back again
She takes a drink and then she waits
The alcohol it permeates
And soon the cells give way, and cancels out the day
I can't keep it all together
I know I know I know...
I can't keep it all together
And the siren's song that is your madness
Holds a truth I can't erase
All alone on your face
Every glamorous sunrise
Throws the planets out of line
A star sign out of whack, a fraudulent zodiac
And the God of Wine is crouched down in my room
You let me down, I said it, now I'm going down
And you're not even around
And I said no no no...
I can't keep it all together
I know I know I know...
I can't keep it all together
And there's a memory of a window
Looking through I see you
Searching for something I could never give you
And there's someone who understands
You more than I do
A sadness I can't erase
All alone on your face

Good For You 
Hey will you stay awhile
My smile will not mislead you
Cause I've been alone
My faith turned to stone
Still there's something in you I believe in
Close to the pierce I go wild and fierce
Still I let you be, I feel you next to me
Cause inside I feel a wind that starts to blow
I'm taken in your undertow
Everything is fine, I'm lonely all the time
Cause all I want to do is be there
For the things that you're going through
Well, is it good for you is it good for you
Cause you haunt my nights when
I don't know where my life should go
Well, is it good for you, is it good for you
Hey child please stay a while
My smile will not mislead you
Cause I've been without I go wild with doubt
I grab at you I can't stop grabbing at you
Cause I feel you cross my mind
In disarray, intoxicated ricochet
There's nothing wrong just don't take too long
Cause all I want to do is be there
For the things that you're going through
Well, is it good for you is it good for you
Cause you haunt my nights when
I don't know where my life should go
Well, is it good for you
Well, is it good for you
All I want to do is be there
For the things that you're going through
Well is it good for you
Well is it good for you
Cause you haunt my nights when
I don't know where my life should go
Well is it good for you
Well is it good for you

Graduate 
Can I graduate
Can I graduate
Can I look in faces that I meet
Can I get my punk ass off the street
I've been living on for so long
Can I graduate
To the bastard talking down to me
Your whipping boy calamity
Cross your fingers, I'm going to knock it all down
Can I graduate
Echo fading we can't let go
She goes walking by in slow mo'
Sell your heart out for a buck
Go on fade out before I get stuck
Talking to somebody like you
Do you live the days you go through
Will this song live on long after we do
Can I graduate
Can I look in faces that I meet
Can I get my punk ass off the street
Won't die on the vine I want to knock it all down
Can I graduate
Echo fading, candle blow
Did you flash out long ago
Cross my fingers, I don't know
Someone poked you down below
Can I graduate
Can I graduate
Can I graduate
Can I graduate
Can I graduate
Can I get my punk ass off the street
Can I look in faces that I meet
I'm not waiting here for you to die
Will this song live on long after we do

How's It Gonna Be 
I'm only pretty sure that I can't take anymore
Before you take a swing
I wonder what are we fighting for
When I say out loud
I wanna get out of this
I wonder is there anything
I'm gonna miss
I wonder how it's gonna to be
When you don't know me
How's it gonna be
When you're sure I'm not there
How's it gonna be
When there's no one there to talk to
Between you and me
Cause I don't care
How's it gonna be
How's it gonna be
Where we used to laugh
There's a shouting match
Sharp as a thumbnail scratch
A silence I can't ignore
Like the hammock by the doorway we spent time in 
tha swings empty
Don't see lightning like last fall
When it was always about to hit me
I wonder how's it gonna be
When it goes down
How's it gonna be
When you're not around
How's it gonna be
When you found out there was nothing
Between you and me
Cause I don't care
How's it gonna be
How's it gonna be
When you don't know me anymore
And how's it gonn be?
Want to get myself back in again
The soft dive of oblivion
I want to taste the salt of your skin
The soft dive of oblivion... oblivion
How's it going to be
When you don't know me anymore
How's it going to be
How's it going to be
How's it going to be

I Want You 
The suckers loose themselves
In the games they learn to play
Children love to sing but
Then their voices slowly fade away
People always take a step away
From what is true
That's why I like you around
I want you
Oh you do you do...
You make me want you
An open invitation to the dance
Happenstance set the vibe that we are in
No apology because my urge is genuine
And the mystery of your rhythm is so feminine
Here I am and I want to take a hit
Of your scent cause it bit so deep into my soul
I want you
Yeah, you do you do...
You make me want you
Oh you do you do...
Send me all your vampires
I want you
And I can't get enough, oh I can't get enough
And I can't get enough
The village church yard is filled with
Bones weeping in the grave
The silver lining of clouds
Shines on people Jesus couldn't save
You want to know how deeply my soul goes
Deeper than bones
Deeper than bones
And I can't get enough
Oh, I can't get enough
Oh, I can't get enough
Oh, I can't get enough
After we did it by the window sill
Smoke rings drift into the midnight sky
Presently in the quilt that your mother made
A candle burns to fight off the gloom
I said to live in this way is not for the meek
And like a jazz DJ you talk me into sleep
I said there'll be no regrets when the worms come
And they will surely come
You do you do...
Make me want you
Send me all your vampires
Yeah you do...
Make me want you
Send me all your vampires
I want you
Send me all your vampires
I want you
Send me all your vampires
Send me all your vampires
There will be no regrets when the worms come
Send me all your vampires

I wish you would step back from that ledge my friend
You could captize the boat of lies that you've been living in
And if you do not want to see me again I would understand
I would understand
The angry boy a bit too insane
Icing over a secret pain
You know you don't belong
You're the first to fight
You're way too loud
You're the flash of light on a burial shroud
I know something's wrong
Well everyone I know has got a reason
To say put the past away
I wish you would step back from that ledge my friend
You could cut ties with all the lies that you've been living in
And if you do not want to see me again I would understand
I would understand
Well he's on the table and he's gone to code
And I do not think anyone knows
What they're doing here
And your friends have left you
You've been dismissed
I never thought it would come to this
And I, I want you to know
Everyone's got to face down the demons
Maybe today
You could put the past away
I wish you would step back from that ledge my friend
You could cut ties with all the lies that you've been living in
And if you do not want to see me again I would understand

London 
Through the satellites, I fight with you
That local brew is spillin'
I know just how you spend your time
I want to get my hands on him
Somebody's party in a London flat
You're where it's at and I know
You want to see me lose my mind
I'm tired of chasing after you
The residue is jealous
See me on the dark side of your mind
I want to get my hands on him
To a club that's pounding in the London rain
The world could end we wouldn't hear it
I know just what's on your mind
I see the way your face has changed
We're no good for each other
You tricked me into coming here
So let go, I don't want to go to London
I told you I don't care
I don't want to go to London
To live there
I don't want to go to London
All your friends afflicted
I don't want to go to London
She's addicted
I saw you with him
I know where you've been
That nose is broken wide open
Your way has got me out of line
I want to get my hands on him
You're so sick to make me prove
It takes a fight to move you
I know just what's on your mind
It's been this way a thousand years
We torture each other
So why the hell'd you call me here
When you know
I don't want to go to London
I told you I don't care
I don't want to go to London
Live there
I don't want to go to London
All your friends afflicted
I don't want to go to London

I don't want to go to London

I don't want to go to London

Somewhere else in London

Losing A Whole Year 
Losing a whole year
Losing a whole year
I remember you and me used to spend
The whole goddamned day in bed
Losing a whole year
Lying in your room we'd lay like dogs
The phone would ring like a joke that's left unsaid
Losing a whole year
Rich daddy left you with a parachute
Your voice sound like money and your face is cute
But your daddy left you with no love
You touch everything with a velvet glove and
Now you want to try a life of sin
You want to be down with the down and in
Always copping my truths
I kind of get the feeling like I'm being used
And now I realize you never heard
One goddamned word I ever said
Losing a whole year
Losing a whole year
I took your stuff and put it in the basement
When I found out what the smile on your face meant
I've seen you pop that check
Craning your neck at my car wreck and
It always seems the juice used to flow
In the car, in the kitchen you were good to go
Now we're stuck with the tube
A sink full of dishes and some aqua lube
And I remember you and me used to
Spend the whole goddamned day in bed
Losing a whole year
And if it's not the defense then you're on the attack
When you start talking I hear the Prozac
Convinced you've found your place
With the pierced queer teens in Cyberspace
When you were yourself it tasted sweet
But it sours into a routine deceit
Well this drama is a bore
And I don't want to play no more
Losing a whole year
I remember you and me used to
Spend the whole goddamned day in bed
Losing a whole year

Motorcycle Drive By 
Summer time and the wind is blowing outside
In lower Chelsea and I don't know
What I'm doing in this city
The sun is always in my eyes
It crashes through the windows
And I'm sleeping on the couch
When I came to visit you
That's when I knew I could never have you
I knew that before you did
Still I'm the one who's stupid
And there's this burning
Like there's always been
I never been so alone
And I've never been so alive
Visions of you on a motorcycle drive by
The cigarette ash flies in your eyes
And you don't mind, you smile
And say the world doesn't fit with you
I don't believe you, you're so serene
Careening through the universe
Your axis on a tilt, you're guiltless and free
I hope you take a piece of me with you
And there's things I'd like to do
That you don't believe in
I would like to build something
But you never see it happen
And there's this burning
Like there's always been
I've never been so alone
And I've, I've never been so alive
And there's this burning
There is this burning
Where's the soul I want to know
New York City is evil
The surface is everything but I could never do that
Someone would see through that
And this is our last time
We'll be friends again
I'll get over you, you'll wonder who I am
And there's this burning
Just like there's always been
I've never been so alone alone
And I've, and I've never been so alive
So alive
I go home to the coast
It starts to rain I paddle out on the water
Alone
Taste the salt and taste the pain
I'm not thinking of you again
Summer dies and swells rise
The sun goes down in my eyes
See this rolling wave
Darkly coming to take me
Home
And I've never been so alone
And I've never been so alive

Narcolepsy 
I'm on a train, but there's no one at the helm
And there's a demon in my brain
Who starts to overwhelm whelm whelm whelm whelm
And there it goes, my last chance for peace
You lay me down, but I get no release
And I say I, I try to keep awake
I try to swim beneath
I try to keep awake
But I, I can feel this narcolepsy slide
Into another nightmare
And there's a demon in my head who starts to play
A nightmare tape loop of what went wrong yesterday
And I hold my breath till it's more than I can take
And I close my eyes and dream that I'm awake
I try to keep awake
I try to keep awake
I try to keep awake
But I, I can feel this narcolepsy slide
Into another nightmare
I read dead Russian authors volumes at a time
I write everything down except what's on my mind
Cause my greatest fear is that sucking sound
And then I know that I'll never get back out
And there's a bone in my hand that connects to a drink
In a crowded room where the glasses clink
And I'll buy you a beer and we'll drink it deep
Because that keeps me from falling asleep I said
How'd you like to be alone and drowning
How'd you like to be alone and drowning
How'd you like to be alone and drowning
How'd you like to be alone and drowning
Still I find this narcolepsy slide slide
Into another nightmare
Keep awake, keep awake, keep awake
And I can feel this narcolepsy slide

Thanks Alot 
It's all in your mind she said
The darkness and the light
The clock it bleeds for you
But you never got the time in right
I woke you up
And I slit the throat of your confidence
And we laughed in the night
And I felt all right
All hands on deck boys
Cause this ship was made to sink
Your swabber salutes you now
But I know what he's thinking
I woke you up
And I slit the throat of your confidence
And we laughed in the night
And I felt all right
Thanks a lot
Thanks a lot
Thanks a lot
The clothes she wears misfit
And she's nervous when she speaks
Her zombie mom and dad
Live in a separate house of freaks
I woke you up
And I slit the throat of your confidence
And we laughed in the night
And I felt all right
Thanks a lot
Thanks a lot
Thanks a lot
I'm the one for you
Cause I know all the dirty things you'd like to do

Everything is quiet since you're not around
And I live in the numbness now
In the background
I do the things we did before
I walk Haight Street to the store
And they say where's that crazy girl
You don't get drunk on red wine and fight no more
I don't see you anymore since the hospital
The plans I make still have you in them
Cause you come swimming into view
And I'm hanging on your words
Like I always used to do
The words they use so lightly
I only feel for you
I only know because I carry you around
In the background
I'm in the background
Words they come and memories all repeat
I lift your head while they change the hospital sheets
And I would never lie to you no
I would never lie to you no
I felt you long after we were through, we were through
The plans I make still have you in them
Cause you come swimming into view
And I'm hanging on your words
Like I always used to do
The words they use so lightly
I only feel for you
I only know because I carry you around
In the background
Cause I felt you long after we were through
Well you come swimming into view
And I'm hanging on your words

Wounded 
The guy who put his hands on you
Has got nothing to do with me
And the bruises that you feel will heal
And I hope you'll come around
Cause we're missing you
And you used to speak so easy
Now you're afraid to talk to me
It's like walking with the wounded
Carrying that weight way to far
Concrete pulled you down so hard
Out there with the wounded
We're missing you
Well I never claimed to understand what happens after dark
But my fingers catch the sparks at the thought of touching you
When you're wounded
Let me break it down till to force the issue
We miss your face and you know we wish you
Would come back down to the Dalva Bar
You tell them, that's just my battle scar
I wanna kiss you
And knock 'em down like we used to
You're the marigold
Till you're walking down shaking that ass again
Then you walk on, baby, walk on, you walk on
On and on
You're an angel in the pit with her hands in the air
And we're missing you
Now it's fall, and your shoulder's get tighter
Nervous flicks on the lighter, boots
Your pissed off poets, your women's groups
And the friends with you, we should have known this fool
Well I guess we missed the mark
Still my fingers catch the sparks at the thought of
Them touching you
Now you're wounded
Let me break it down till to force the issue
You never come around, and you know we miss you
Well nobody took your pride away
I say, that's something people say
Back down the bully to the back of the bus
Cause it's time for them to be scared of us
Till you're yelling, how we living cause you got the ball
Then you rock on, baby, rock on, you rock on
On and on
You're a summer time hottie with her socks in the air
Screaming I won't care, baby, I don't care, no
You say you don't know
You say you can't grow (you're the marigold)
All I know is we're missing you, you
You say you don't know
You say you can't grow (you're the marigold)
All I know is we're missing you

Aus Dem Leben Einer Nutte 
Viele nchte lag ich wach
Meine hnde rot
Vom rubbeln schwach
Den kelch mit samen aufgefllt
Seinen pimmel in gummi eingehllt
Wo kann ich suchen der mich stt
Wo ist der typ der mich entblst

Er ist nicht von dieser welt
Der fick pro nacht fr viel viel geld
Ohne fick wrs schlecht um mich bestellt
Es ist wahr wenn ich dir sage
Ohne kondom kommts nicht in frage
Kann ich noch ficken ohne dich
Ein orgasmus brauch ich nicht
Doch heute wei ich es genau
Ich will poppen wie ne geile sau

Ich hass die schmerzen die ich spre
Meine fotze ist ne offene tre
Niemals ein guter fick von dir
Ich spr ihn immer noch ganz tief in mir
Er steigt auch mmer wieder drauf
Ich glaub es hrt nie wieder auf
Das was mir am fick gefllt
Ist einfach nur das ganze geld

Declaration Of Dependance 
Fridays have never lasted so long
Rain was so appropriate
For the setting and downfall
Of my heart
Just so hard to comprehend
That for 4 dollars 
I can have my heart
Ripped to shreds
I should've known, they told me
But I just couldn't hear
The words they said all fell upon deaf ears
Just go away
High expectations lead to nothing
But disappointment
And I hate the way you make me
Hate myself
This song's so damn emo it makes me sick
The things you make me do
Waiting in endless procession
That halts my life
I wish I had my life in my own hands
But you have the reigns
And you're steering me off the road
Leads to your heart
I wish life had no consequences
Or else my body would lie
Cold under the dust and darkness
Of sharpened steel
The crazy things I say because of you
That feeling again
Of illuminated eyes
Meeting mine
I want to give you goosebumps again
Listen to the echo of my heartbeat
Your hand in mine, unacquainted
With the world around us
But homecoming calls and you have to leave
Because hes there
Where I should be with you
Stealing the show

The Breakup Song (sundays Always Suck) 
She broke my heart on Sunday night, so I didn't go to school
I saw her Monday afternoon and I didn't know what to do
I wanted to go up to her, and get down on my knees
Wanted to tell her that I loved her and that she's all I'll ever need
She's all I thought about for days on end, often cried myself to sleep
I guess it was just mixed signals, I got myself in too deep
She said it definitely wasn't me, that she just needed to be alone
But I've had enough of being by myself and being out here on my own
It sucks to know that you're not wanted
And not good enough for some girl
The trouble was that I still was wanted
And that girl was my whole world
I thought about her constantly
I wanted to break down and cry
The pain was the worst Idd ever felt
Just wanted to give up and die
She said she needed to be by herself and make sure she could survive
She didn't want the pressure of boys making her sad and cry
But she said we'd still be friends and that she'd be there just for me
But friends can become lovers and friends can become enemies
I didn't want that to happen to us, I loved her like no one else
I didn't understand she loved me too, she just needed to find herself
It sucks to feel like you're a loser
And can't get a break at all
It sucks when she says you're not a loser
And is there to break your fall
But falls were not all that she had broken
I loved her oh so much
My heart was among the wreckage
With all the settled dust
She broke my heart on Sunday night, and I still haven't forgot
She's on my mind still, day 
&
 night

Bring Back Humanity 
Woke up today, and I turned on the news.
Saw all the new products for us to use and abuse.
All the things that they are trying to sell 
Our bodies, our minds, our souls, and everything else.
It's a neverending story and it's only getting worse,
When it comes to humanity or money, the product never comes first.
Well I never thought I'd see in my lifetime such a steep decline.
And nobody's willing to stick out their necks
For fear of decapitation by the corporate execs.
Between corporate whores and world wide wars, terrorist attacks and the US evening the scores.
Everybody is cashing in.
It's the fucked up situation in the world we're livin' in.
Never thought I'd see in my life such a steep decline.
It's the time to make it right.
We are the future of our own society.

everything about you now is so unpredictable.

The Pain We Miss 
its never too late, 
a word can paint 1000 memories, 
whether luck or fate, 
makes our stories tragedies. 
Hearts bleed songs a lot like this, 
nothing can bring back the pain we miss.

Great and terrible are things
That feed on fear
Afflicting all the weak,
Sucking up their tears
Drain the life from those who cannot
Stand the night
Demise will manifest as assassins of the light
Storm clouds fill the horizon
Pitching days into night
Beseech the blackened sky
For no light shines
Call upon your sins to give you great ascent
Give no quarter to the coward
Shade of blackness holds the truth behind the sun
Pages of the holy word, commit to flame
Burning sickle, has come to take your head
They're coming for you, assassins of the

A plague of Antichrists
Sent from the depths of hell
To sacrifice your gods
Obscured by haze
On this, the last of days

Astonished faces look his way, as the hopeful carry horror in their hearts
Uncertain of a power that malice forged in steel
I must face this threat that challenges our lives
I'll strike out with vengeance, I'll reap from their demise
No! You must not seek the blades, it's said that they are cursed
Possesses you if they're found, to the dreadlord they are bound
Cutting flesh for him to eat, bloody raw Lucifer meat
Peril awaits you in the fjords, we cannot lose you to the...

You must go to save us all
At last they're found floating in a crystal orb
Speak the incantation written on the wall
In a blinding flash the axes fly into his hands
Too much power for him to bear, he'll wreak havoc on the land
Wreaking havoc on the land

A place where legend speaks of terrible things
I've heard the rumors of the evil in the hills
Spire of the tower a beacon for the damned
Its force of will grips you like an unseen hand
A blacked spire rises high against the sky
Casting shadows on the land
You cannot turn away your mind has been possessed
Another victim to fulfill the darkened quest
Hollowed eyes of all the fools who came too near
Set upon the unsuspecting world below
Forged long ago in ancient forests
Now, alone it stands
Against this desolate earth
Since long before out time
These walls have unleashed plagues of war
These fools have unleashed plagues of war
Into the land
Long ago an ancient malice left its mark
Awoken by the curiosity of men
Black spire looms above the edifice of pain
Calling all its allies to rise up from the pit
Drawn towards seduction and the power of the curse
The thunder of chaos boils in the sky
For on this infernal night the human race dies
Force of will, cold and cruel, can't resist, power of the curse

A masterstroke with the devil's every swing
The hell you dreamed of was never so real

No opposition can counter the strike

Slave of reality for one more of the flock
You soul, it decomposes

Cryptic signs holding evil thoughts at bay
While your sins, your sins are washed away
As fallen angles we will fight
Against a kind that's dead and gone

Unholy wars wages upon the land
Merciless wrath upon the non-believer

The golden-tongued orator
Spreads only wicked lies

Ashes and dust return to the Earth

And flames lick at the gates
Their dominion decays and it falls
The kingdom and crusaders
Their spell is weakened

Fear On The Bridge (Upon The Boiling Sea I) 
Behold a speeding shape
A ship upon the waves
Racing swift as death
Torment from the pits of Hell
In seas where pirates dwell
The armada sets it's course
Shadowed by skull and cross-boned force
The crow's nest spots the flag
The captain's plans have hit a snag
With your lives, defend the gold
In a fire fight yet to unfold
Opposing ships steered side by side
Fear on the bridge is realized
Cannons blaze in wood they blast
The Spanish ship is sinking fast
Raiders board the ship
Plunder all their fold
As they're lunging for the kill
Their riches will be ours
Take no prisoners
Leave no man alive
For the ransacking awaits
The decks awash with blood
Fight to the death
There is no other way
Honour will say
Kill
That captains duel on the plank
When all are dead and all is won
There's riches here to steal
Bodies scattered by the waves
For sharks do make their meal in flesh
Flesh
Rain begins to fall
Their fold becomes our wealth
As they sink into the sea
No mercy for the rich
We wash their blood
From our bounty gold
We feast tonight
We're heading due west
For the secret island port
The plunder divides
But give a piece to the sea
When madness of the fever grips and greed is taking hold
Nothing can ever cure your thirst except for rum and gold
Nothing can quench the thirst except for rum and gold

Forest King 
Knee deep in the dead of their kind
They carry on without seeming to mind
Feed off their flesh, larger they grow
Persevere through ice, wind and snow
When metal beasts come crashing through the under brush
Through old majestic growth
To defend itself the forest will come to life
Encroachment against humanity, running root breaking stone
Rise up feed off the dead
Towering giants fill you with dread
Avenge the axe, avenge the blade
Cleansing all the parasites
A green shadow cast upon the world
Pushed to the brink the trees reclaim what is theirs
Collapse tall buildings for the survival of their kind
Payments coming for every cut that you've made
Feed off the dead, fill you with dread
Payments coming
Above their heads shine the stars of the night
Rising up to the dark through the light
Mighty giants, standing arm to arm
Warriors march forward, sound the alarm
Rise up
Born of the earth, more armies advance
The forest king will reign
Overtaking cities with branches they ensnare
Pushing the human race back a million years
The earth grows quiet all plant life will dominate again
When every structure falls you'll know the forest is king

God Of The Cold White Silence 
When it's cold and the ice grips your skin
Few can stomach how harsh it is
In the woods lurks a great old one
Who can scare the flesh right off your bones
A ravenous specter
Walker on the wind
By many names it's known
But nothing's more fearsome when its face is shown
You'll fall to your knees and beg to
The god of the cold white silence
A frozen giant with a heart made of ice
Hideous flesh eating creature of northern desolation
In a land so cold
Its story told for hundreds of years
A horrid giant born from the snow
Face to face you'll be torn apart
By its claws or merely its gaze
Under black skies treads this grim arctic god
Oh great old one, god of the lost
Long and bitter winter
At the mercy of the arctic gods
God of the cold white silence

Isle Of Eternal Despair (Upon The Boiling Sea Iii) 
Kiss the sand, praising a dry land he has found
Everywhere on shore there's treasure all around
Bury deep the horded loot far down below
No man or god will ever take away your plunder
He will find a cave to hide away the gold
Doomed to a desert isle
All of the riches in his hands
No living thing around
But he will never leave the cave
Alone with bounty gold
Something compels him to stay
Heaven or Hell, time will tell
The captain thinks what will come of this
If this is the end, the gold must die with me
Delving underground, to his dismay
The captain finds a curse
The isle of eternal despair, spend eternity alone
The isle of eternal despair, with gold beyond his dreams
What a sight that's sitting right before his eyes
Ancient spoils of the pirates of the past
Skeletons are sheathed in gold by candlelight
Hunger sets but he will guard the jewels forever
Now he's punished by the gods
Forever pondering his greed
But he's doomed to eternal life
As a golden skeleton
The isle of eternal despair, doomed as his flesh beings to rot
The isle of eternal despair, knowing he'll never really die
As he decays into living, golden bones
Eyes open watching for the rest of his life

Lord Of The Storm (Upon The Boiling Sea Ii) 
Lord of the storm rides in the eye, eye of the hurricane
Lord of the storm rides in the eye, in the eye of Hell
Rider on the night and ruler of the damned
Damnation creeps upon everyone, a sense of fatal warning
Within the crew there's treachery, a mutiny is brewing
The first mate draws his cutlass forth, towards the captain challenging a duel
You've sentenced us to a watery grave, this ship will sink into the sea
A brutal storm is on the rise, wrath of an angered deity
Batten down the hatches for a struggle that will take all of our lives
None shall live to tell the tale of this wretched night
Terror of the seven seas, Lord of the storm spreads like disease
Unlike anything seen before, the Lord of the storm
Behold the wrath the skies unleash
Until we're dead it shall not cease
The gods have made their judgement call
And it spells certain death
The captain mind cannot be swayed
He'd rather die than give away
All of the treasure chests below
To the grip of the unforgiving deep
Blinding lightning sears the flesh
Raindrops fall like musketballs
Piercing the skin, wood, steel and bone
All aboard will pay
The captain surfaces for air amongst the torrent nightmare
Latching to a piece of the hull, destruction's everywhere
No more survivors from the blast, the ship drifts beneath the waves
The master coasts for hours, before the storm begins to wane
An albatross flies overhead, a sign that land is near
An island spotted in the distance, maybe the torment is at an end
Rain is gone, but doom is near, a shadow's on his heart
Immortality is his, salted tears will drench his days
The captains' lost upon the seas
Penance for his wicked deeds
Cheated by his crew and God
As he floats and waits to drown
He has no clue what lies ahead
A deadly isle for him to dread
He thinks he can rebuild his life
Set sail to conquer the sea again
As he touches his feet upon the sandy shore
The sun will rise once more
Lord of the storm rides in the eye, eye of the hurricane
Lord of the storm rides in the eye, in the eye of Hell
Rider on the night, ruler of the damned

Night Marauders 
Night marauders lay waste to the land
Honorless battle, consuming the dead
Collecting bodies to consume
Keep the engine burning hot, apocalyptic war machine
Needs fuel for fire, nomadic fighters rule the land
Basic wants in dire need, all around a crippled Earth
Few have survived
All who live nothing's left, scavengers
Walking around with radiation burns
Take no prisoners, all will be damned
Fight without mercy, there's fates worse than death
Surrounded by the carcass
Build your world in dust
Shadow of the fallen
All you see is war
In the end of time, no world
Left to control
Only the burning of flesh
Will persist
Hour by hour
The only future that's real
Throughout the tired
Hollow waste
Cries the mass to live again
Poison fumes corrupt the veins
Breathing deep
Violent killers on the prowl
Seek to take the human crown
Bound by bloodshed
And the roaring steel
All who live
Nothing's left, scavengers
Walking around with
Radiation burns
Who will rule,
Night marauding warriors
In the end of time,
No world left to control
Only the burning of flesh will persist
Eternal and futile,
In the end of time,
No world left to control

Phantom Of The Crimson Cloak 
Out of the fog comes a huddles shape
Cloaked head to toe in crimson flowing robes
It hunts, kills, eats
Unseen in sickening mists of night, some evil's lurking in the gloom
Voracious hunting appetite and piercing demon eyes
A mandrake sets upon it's prey, slashing mangled claw
Soulstealer strangling terror, in crimson cloak it kills
Mortals who cross the path
The phantom hunts and kills
With a swift ferocity
The demon's carcass strikes
Death is his way, dare not cross hi path
The phantom of the crimson cloak stalks the dark and silent night
A killer waiting for the strike, in silence you will stand in fright
Captured by it's frozen stare, your body drained of essence
Predator of the pure in heart, sending all their souls to Hell
There is no escape from here, phantom horror attack
He must feed
On innocent human flesh
To hold the madness at bay
That torments his eternal march
Death is his way, dare not cross hi path
The phantom of the crimson cloak stalks the dark and silent night
An ancient corpse
He's trod this worn path
Many forlorn years
Aeons yet to come
Death is his way, dare not cross his path
The phantom of the crimson cloak stalks the dark and silent night

Premonition Of Pain 
Awoken by the terror of a thousand wars
A vision of the coming invading force
With haste he goes to the royal hall
The soothsayer alerts the king, the hour is night
The king scoffs, says no, he does not believe
You must be in error, you must be deceived
My lord, they're coming, your people aren't safe
Upon deaf ears fall words of fate
I hold the key to what lies beyond
You won't believe what this crystal orb does show
And in his dreams he saw
Brick by brick...behold
Stone by stone...our fate
Wall by wall
This castle is set to burn
When the soothsayer's riddle is spoken, beware of the answers it holds
I hold the key to what lies beyond
When the soothsayer's words make you question, the price will be paid in blood
You won't believe what this crystal orb does show
With no more than a reason to kill
The enemy's approaching from surrounding sides
Awaiting for the first strike as catapults are drawn
Flaming arrows form the sky. The massacre begins
Order turns to chaos, no hope to win
The tyrant is here to take up your throne
He'll take off you head before taking your crown
The mystic, he laughs, you should have listened to me
But now you beg for you life on your knees
On your knees
On your knees
When the soothsayer's riddle is spoken, it could hold the outcome of war
I hold the key to what lies beyond
When the soothsayer's words speak of bloodshed, just pray that the blood is not yours
You won't believe
The price paid in blood
The price paid in blood
Just pray that the blood is not yours

Quest For The Manticore 
[Bonus track off the Japanese release]
Look up
What does my lantern light?
A mythical beast takes flight
And flies overhead
And strikes with the head of a lion
Wings of a bird
Tail of a stinging scorpion scourge
Let's go seek the creature
Of legend and lore
Taking our bows on a quest for the manticore
It haunts the night, stalking, preying on the skies
Killing again, it's time to hunt and slay the beast
Why do your bravest soldiers
Join you on your quest
A company of might and magic equal to the test
Defend with all your skill, leave all your doubts behind
No one shortsword could be enough to kill the manticore
Slay the fearsome beast, the manticore
Or you will rest in peace, the manticore
Paralyze you cold, the manticore
A power to behold, the manticore
The beast, it hunts, for meat, preying on human death
On it's trail
Will you strike
Do you dare?
A demon that kills in the night devouring flesh
Into the horror's lair
Devoid of all things light
Stalking you from the darkness with the clearest sight
One swift violent motion
Stinger in your eye
Poisons coursing through, freezing up your mind
Body's growing cold, the manticore
You will die alone, the manticore
It ate your friends alive, the manticore
You're the last to kill, the manticore
Cold, the creature will eat you alive
Befor e the reaper closes your eyes
Tearing the skin from your back
Relentless in attack
Your last ef fort strength and home
Magic dagger in it's throat
Blood running into your mouth
Choking on it's pain
When they find you
They won't know you rose to stand and heed the call!

Revenge Is A Vulture 
A sacred pact signed in blood, two allies strong in war
To the death they will defend if an enemy comes forth
Corruption rears it's ugly head, feed a traitors mind
Stab in the back remains, to break the oath
This ancient bond of trust shattered by a fool
Upon betrayal, all thoughts turn to...
Revenge - Revenge is a vulture
Take him for everything he's got
Revenge - Revenge is a vulture
He won't know what he had until it's lost
Revenge!
The stage is set, a battlefield, victory or death
Valor will prevail against an insult to you name
An alliance failed, the oath remains no more
This allegiance based on trust has become war
The birds of prey shall feast on carrion
As their world crumbles
Revenge - Revenge is a vulture
Deceiver's flesh ripped off his wretched bones
Revenge - Revenge is a vulture
His head placed on a pike for all to see
A lesson learned for all of the usurpers to the throne
Bridges burned, honour lost, forever damn his kind
Forever damn his kind
Victory will be ours, their treachery returned
A shallow grave awaits
Forever damn his kind
A shallow grave awaits

Swordmaster 
Born with shining steel in hand, fighting's all you know
Mastering the blade, to kill those who betray
With skill and deadly grace, severed heads erase
A wrong that has been done, only death can overcome
Master of the blade, wielder of the steel
With iron fury, killer fire and speed
With his mighty sword he reaps his vengeance
Coming from the depths to right a wrong
From the depths of Hell
To deal his wrath
Swordmaster, bounty hunter for the damned
Stand and Fight - Kill or Die
His blade is gleaming and from it blood is streaming
None shall survive beyond the light of dawn
None shall survive beyond morning light
Vengeance served with cold delight, bodies split in two
Bone and sinew spray for debts that come to be repaid
Bloodlust in your mind, the painful truth is what they'll find
The course is at an end, to Hell is where he sends you
Swordmaster, bounty hunter for the damned
Stand and Fight - Kill or Die
The master moves on, keeping the balance of the world
Crusher of souls and ruler of Hell

The Great Hall Of Feasting 
As the day breaks and the battle hour approaches
Many cries will echo through the hills
Be not afraid your sacrifice is not in vain
The God's reward for dying with your sword in hand
Roaring fires, strumming lyrics
Clean the blood stain from you
Blade before coming in
Enter the massive feasting hall
Above the roar, tales are told of war
And heroes lost forever
Your name will live in song on high and down below
Your kills in fighting have earned your special place
Mentioned in the same breath as all heroes past
A statue of your likeness, revered forever more
Flagons clank, and beers are drank
In the mighty hall
Tales are told of woe
In the might hall
The goats are roasted slow
In the mighty hall
Let us sing the songs of old
In the mighty hall
All sound a mighty SK?L
In the great feasting hall, splendor of all
Die in battle do us proud

The Hydra's Teeth 
The finest crew ever assembled, to Colchis, their destination
A kingdom's fortunes in the branches of a tree
But terror springs up from the ground
Born of the dragon's mouth, seeds of
Death planted in barren soil
The Argonauts state their intentions, as insult is felt by the kind
This great quest is nearly halted
But Medea leads them to their prize, like weeds they grow
Warriors of the undead world, bones without flesh
Immune to the blade, offspring of Hecate's foul womb
Up the mountain to a yawning cave
A fell beast guards the Golden Fleece
The Argo leader steps up to win the day
Harmed not by the weaponry of man
Brutal offspring of tormented minds
Armed with steel and lust for death
Relentless demons, the children of the hydra's teeth
Warriors of bone scream a ghastly cry
Commanded to kill them all
The ones who escape make off with the fleece
Sail back to the Agean Sea
Squads of death prowl the land
Killing in silence, killing by hand
Cloaked in darkness, masters of stealth
They lust for your blood
Not for your wealth

Trial Of Champions 
Enslaved by warlords from far away lands
Forced into a life of slavery
Forced to fight your brothers for rulers so cruel
A killer instinct your only escape
Ferocious battle, you must fight to survive
Each weapon an extension of your strength
All victories add greatness to your name
Fight to the death, there will be no surrender
Your cunning must be afforded
There will be no remorse for those who gamble with your fate
Freedom, through killing strangers will it come
You fight to live, freedom gained with every shiv
You need to prove, prove your worth
To ascend to the trial of champions
Every fight a battle to the death
Your fate lies in the hands of fools
A meager wager more precious than your life
When the thumb comes down
You know just what to do
Kill kill kill
It's your time do what must be done
Every day you fight, every day you win
Taking the life of the emperor
The ultimate reward for surviving the trial
You will not die in chains, a champion you are

Wykydtron 
In the year four thousand fifty five, Wykydtron came to life
Born of a scientific design to serve all human kind
Artificial intelligence bred for future war
When galaxies will crumble and fall to their knees
It breaks free from it's hold taking military control
A fate seen all across the world
It takes hold of the Earth, breeding legions to his control
Soon to seize all power in the sky
Programmed to crush
Programmed to destroy
Its brainwaves only wired for death
It's wired to kill
All on the Earth
Nuclear bound - you'll fear his name
Hey it's The Wykydtron
It's The Wykydtron
Hey it's the Wykydtron
Whoa-oh!
An army's formed to crush the Earth
Our creation, the master of our demise
Humanity is doomed
Fifteen years since creation's time, the war has turned to space
Human kind has one chance left to turn the tides of fate
Warheads are the only way to stop The Wykydtron
Millions die, radiation blast from Hell
Flesh, it peels away as all the people die
This is the end of the human race
Our creation becomes the master of our own demise
We are drones
We fooled ourselves
We finally sealed our fate
He it's the Wykydtron
It's the Wykydtron
Hey it's the Wykydtron

Watchin the time roll by
And I could not understand half of whats in my head
That's half I wont regret.
I had to wonder am I falling under

I have to wonder am I falling under
Have I lost whats in my life
I need the answers to these questions in my mind
Yeah let me know the way
It may be a lie 
But today Im taking back whats mine.
I'll find a better side to this song down the line
And in my mind I'll try and pretend everything's alright
And I dont need much time
But you wont even try

So I had to wonder

Am I falling from her 
Have I lost whats in my life.

Landlord 
Silverfish are swimming in and out of my walls  
 my heat is out -- you don't return my calls  
 the snow is drifted up -- i can't get my mail  
 my faith in mankind is beginning to fail...  
 ..kind of like my washer and my dryer  
 the latter of which sets my clothes on fire  
 evil, evil man -- i'm under your spell  
 but everybody knows you're the landlord from hell  
 i can't believe the things that you're doing to me  
 i can't believe the rotten things you've done to me  
 my windows don't close and my sinks don't drain  
 on a sunny day my roof can't keep out the rain  
 find a buyer and i'm ready to sell  
 but i'll be sure to tell the suckers you're a landlord from hell  
 [chorus]  
 the floor is buckled, the furnace belches smoke  
 when i turn on the faucet i'm sure to get soaked  
 the outlets aren't grounded, i always get a shock  
 upwards around fourteen hundred kilowatts  
 i pay my bills and nothing gets done  
 you're a sadomasochist who thinks it's fun  
 you're an evil man, you ain't norman fell  
 that's why landlord i'll see you in hell

Parking Lot 
Invite your friends invite your coworkers  
 invite vets and coast guard deserters  
 invite the haves and the have-nots  
 now's the time to take stock in what we got  
 click n click n clack goes the train on the track  
 we got to get them all here before we hit the sack  
 everybody's bothered -- everybody's hot  
 got a party in the parking lot  
 we got a soiree  
 we've got a wing ding  
 we've got a party  
 we've got reason to sing  
 nicholas the second and elvis presley too

 andy rooney's smokin up in a shack  
 while sonny and cher are making out in back

 but this is what a party's supposed to be about  
 we've got to mosey somewhere before the party's shot

 [chorus]  
 we've got 6 pack party favors  
 cocktail weenies in a dozen flavors  
 keys in the front yard -- dancing in the back  
 i'll take a parking lot to any old love shack  
 now there's just a few of us -- and the garbage  
 got nothing to eat except some mustard in the fridge  
 everybody's passed out there's hardly a sound  
 except the drunken shriner who's still dancing around  
 my sister left with the band around three a.m.  
 i've got a migraine from my eyes to my brain stem  
 hope our guests liked it, hope they liked lots  
 gotta party in the parking lot

Rude Girl 
Last saturday night the gang was hangin out  
 only two dollars to our name  
 thin black tie and polished shoooes  
 we were out playin the game  
 jeff pointed out the lass in the dress  
 said "she was the one to be had"  
 all the guys were talkin about her  
 said, "man she looked bad in plaid"  
 rude girl, met her at dance hall party  
 dancing, swinging round everybody  
 rude girl, watching her steal the show  
 walked up, said hello, asked her to dance and she said, "let's go"  
 she hopped it up and she stepped it down  
 must've been the best rude girl in town  
 the band was hot but she kept her cool  
 made the other dancers look like fools  
 joe and luke were talkin jive in the back  
 the horns were doing their thing  
 but jay was doing double takes and watching that rude girl swing  
 one o'clock came and the dance was done  
 the band was ready to hit the town  
 i searched round and round the club  
 but rude girl was nowhere to be found  
 rude girl, haven't seen her since the dance last week  
 i began wondering, what's the future for her and me  
 rude girls, a pack of them walking by  
 at a glance, a new one caught my eye

Sno Cone Of Luv 
Just me and my dear old madre 
 walkin through the state fair on a dusty day 
 snortin cotton candy and pointin out the freaks 
 that are strollin up and down the garbage strewn midway 
 we secretly laughed at the black toothed man 
 ho works at the boothe where you throw the balls 
 for the cheap stuffed animals god i felt like i could win them all 
 (sno cone of love) 
 (get your ticketes and stand in line for the sno cone of love) 
 corn dogs mingled with dust and sweat make 
 a horrid taste but i can't get enough 
 the recipe makes me hallucinate my own sno cone of love 
 you see it for a second then it's gone (sno cone of love) 
 your vision quest is mowing the lawn (sno cone of love) 
 i don;t think that you understand 
 that when it's your time, watch carefully (sno cone of love) 
 the vision came with the force of a thousand horses -- 
 steeds of rage and might 
 while others watched ponies swirling til they died 
 in that cloudy moonless night 
 the churning lights of the ferris wheel will blind the wise 
 and confound the fools 
 but i saw the light, i felt the love -- their eyes were murky pools 
 my day at the dusty state fair 
 left me with some questions and some memories 
 vague recollections of what i ate 
 and the endless march of petting zoo ponies 
 i secretly laugh at the black toothed man 
 whose eyes were clear and focused above 
 at the rotating lights above my foggy head 
 was it his own sno cone of love? 
 you see it for a second then it's gone (sno cone of love) 
 your vision quest is mowing the lawn (sno cone of love) 
 i don't think you understand 
 that when it's your time, watch carefully 
 (right this way for the sno cone of love)

 funny things that i had seen but  
 there was one strip yeah it filled me full of hatred and i  
 think you know you know what i mean  
 it was the circle at the bottom with those circle headed kids by  
 that yellow bellied mother scratcher -- bil keane  
 that's why i.....  
 [chorus]  
 used to have a job -- nothing special it paid five twenty-five  
 every so often a customer'd walk in  
 just to remind me that i was alive  
 but then one day my boss said, "jeff, grab a chair" --  
 he said "i'm gonna have to take you take you aside"  
 well the dirty bastard fired me but lucky for him  
 i had my tangerine to keep me from homicide

Well I know I'm not as popular as I,
As I should be to even think of asking you this...
I wanna know if you're not busy could we 
catch a movie or maybe spend the night alone?
Why is it so hard to even try?
Don't ask me I don't know why.
All I know is this is a test, 
coming out on top is best.
That is all determined now if you just say yes.
I'm asking, go out with me, I miss you.
Yeah,Yeah (I've laid it out)
Yeah,Yeah (I've fallen out)
Yeah,Yeah (I've figured out)
Yeah,Yeah (I'm home now)
Well I know I'm not as strong as I should be.
I know exactly how it feels to have to walk alone.
And I know that life is how you lived it,
So laugh it all off even if you have to laugh alone.
Why is it so hard to even try?
Don't ask me I don't know why.
All I know is this is a test, 
coming out on top is best.
That is all determined now if you just say yes.
I'm asking, go out with me, I miss you.

Do you ever think about me
Do you ever cry yourself to sleep
In the middle of the night when you're awake
Are you calling out for me
Do you ever reminisce
I can't believe I'm acting like this
Oh it's crazy
How I still can feel your kiss
[Chorus]
It's been six months, eight days, twelve hours since you ran away
I miss you so much and I don't know what to say
I should be over you
I should know better
But it's just not the case
It's been six months, eight days, twelve hours since you ran away
Do you ever ask about me
Do your friends still tell you what to do
Every time the phone rings
Do you wish it was me calling you
Do you still feel the same
Or has time put out the flame
I miss you
Is everything okay
[Chorus]
It's been six months, eight days, twelve hours since you ran away
I miss you so much and I don't know what to say
I should be over you
I should know better
But it's just not the case
It's been six months, eight days, twelve hours since you ran away
It's hard enough
Just passing the time
When I can't seem to get you off my mind
Where is the good in goodbye
Tell me why
Tell me why
[Chorus]
It's been six months, eight days, twelve hours since you ran away
I miss you so much and I don't know what to say
I should be over you
I should know better
But it's just not the case
It's been six months, eight days, twelve hours since you ran away

Arizona Rain 
My heart is like a desert
Gone too long without rain
And your love is like the water
That makes the river run again
I'm burning like the Tucson sand
Broken as the partched, dry ground
I need to feel you
Raining down
[Chorus]
I wanna feel your love like the Arizona rain
Pouring down like a hurricane
I wanna drown my soul and wash away the pain
In the Arizona rain
Well it feels like forever since
Last time I looked into your eyes
And I need to be reminded
And I need to be revived
So love me like a long lost friend
Caress me like the desert wind
And make a partched heart
Bloom again
[Chorus]
I wanna feel your love like the Arizona rain
Pouring down like a hurricane
I wanna drown my soul and wash away the pain
In the Arizona rain
I wanna feel your love like the Arizona rain
Pouring down like a hurricane
I wanna drown my soul and wash away the pain
In the Arizona rain
Rain
I need to feel you
In the Arizona rain
I wanna feel your love
In the Arizona rain

I wanna feel your love like the Arizona rain
Pouring down like a hurricane (I wanna feel your love)
I wanna drown my soul and wash away the pain

I wanna feel your love like the Arizona rain
Pouring down like a hurricane
I wanna drown my soul and wash away the pain

Pulling me under
You're leaving me breathless
Feeling the thunder
My heart is helpless
It's true
You come around and the stars light up the sky
Say my name and how could I describe
[Chorus]
That's the way you love me baby
Baby that's the way
You lift me up
You chase the clouds away
And like the sun you melt my sadness
You come and fill my heart with gladness
Baby
Baby that's the way
Out of the clear blue
Something so tender
I wanna be near you
I wanna surrender oh baby baby
I have to smile 'cause you seem so unaware
Just a touch and I'm dancing in mid-air
[Chorus]
That's the way you love me baby
Baby that's the way
You lift me up
You chase the clouds away
And like the sun you melt my sadness
You come and fill my heart with gladness
Baby
Baby that's the way
I was searching for meaning
I had lost my faith in love
'Till you came along
And filled my life with your song
You turned my world around baby
Baby that's the way
You lift me up
You chase the clouds away
And like the sun you melt my sadness
You come and fill my heart with gladness
Baby
Baby that's the way
Baby that's the way
Like the sun you melt my sadness
Baby that's the way
You come and fill my heart with gladness

It Happened To Me 
Two good friends
Friday night
A chick flick in the VCR
I watched you
Roll your eyes
And knew I'd have to twist your arm when you said
"You expect a guy like me to sit and watch this mushy stuff!
They always fall in love when they first meet
That never happens to folks like us."
But I just sat there and grinned
Tried not to laugh out loud cause I remember when
It happened to me just a few months back
In the middle of the week and just like that
Got weak in the knees
A little short of breath
Man I had it bad and boy I bet 
It would blow your mind if you only knew
It happened to me
When I met you
I heard you say
You're not like me
You don't believe in fairy tales
I bit my tougue
Didn't speak
I sat there thinking to myself that
I used to feel the way you feel
I thought
Love was fake and make-believe right up until
It happened to me just a few months back
In the middle of the week and just like that
Got weak in the knees
A little short of breath
Man I had it bad and boy I bet 
It would blow your mind if you only knew
It happened to me
When I met you
I used to feel the way you feel
I thought 
Love was fake and make-believe right up until
It happened to me just a few months back
In the middle of the week and just like that
Got weak in the knees
A little short of breath
Man I had it bad and boy I bet

Coper tone tane in a mucle shirt 
A dirt red jeep coming home from work 
Odds are preatty good he was stoping at the texaco 
She was standing there in a preatty pink dress 
By a pepsi sign that said 99 cents
Put her lipstick on and she heard his radio
Comes down to just one moment 
No way you can control it 
Somehow your heart will know the place and time 
Totaly unexpected 
Planet won't be effected
But when the stars all line up right
It won't change the world but it just might change your life
He filled up with high tes gas and saw her standing behind the glass 
He walked in to get a better look at her
Right there between the chips and ice cream 
Stood the answer to a young mans dream 
Just one look and his whole life took a turn
Comes down to just one moment 
No way you can control it 
Somehow your heart will know the place and time 
Totaly unexpected 
Plan it won't be effected
But when the stars all line up right 
It won't change the world but it just might change your life
Sunset on a new horizon 
As they drove away, ay, ay, ay
They drove away 
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

That love would come
Along and make me feel this way
I know that it was real
When it finally came someday

If I never wash away this kiss

So insecure
Only that I had been in love before
But I was in need
Love is so much more

If I never wash away this kiss
If I left it there right where it is
Baby I could always feel like this
If I never wash away this kiss
Love like the candle's light
Will dance away the dark

The first time we met
I'll never forget
The very last thing on my mind was love
When our lips touched
I knew that's what it was

and make out in my car
i know im not a rock star
so you'll never look my way
but maybe if you haer my song
you'll come to me someday

Wonder Why 
show me a sign thats going nowhere
show me a road that waves goodbye
show me a place where i am someone
taking me away from this living lie
wonder walking down the streets on sunday
smoke ciggarettes and waste my time
ask where the clouds will take me someday
wanna leave reality behind
and no one wants to be like me
until im someone else
until the day they go away
ill wonder by myself
run from a world thats bringing me down
hang with the friends that get me high
follow the sign thats going nowhere
look for a road that waves goodbye
mommy tell me where im going
never knowing, never showing
take me back to times when things were easier
i wanna be a kid again
go back to days so innocent
wont sunday streets please take me far away

Yearbook 
saw you in your yearbook picture
love at first sight, had to meet ya
maybe not obsession but a feeling close to home
starting talking in the chatrooms
or a phone call when the nerve rose
seems to me we were so close, but your so faw away
and all the guys would tell me everyway to win her heart
so i began to do it still dunno where to start
please someone make the first move or im gonna lose my head
looking at your pretty face ill beat my head against the yearbook
cause melindas the kinda girl who makes me feel
like the rainy days outside my window
aint for real
(melinda)i got a blow up girl and named her after you
cause when i see your senior picture i feel like 
im a freshman again
days went by i got to know ya
thought of all the good times i could show ya
everything about you so perfect in everyway
your pretty eyes
your little smile
i was told she'd wait a while
but impatience got me and ya sent me on my way
in everything you did, i saw a little bit of me
but once upon a times the only way we are meant to be
like children on a playground
im afraid to talk to you
watching every move you make 
ill drop the petals on my yearbook

87th And Nowhere 
A Scrapbook of bad memories
Torchering and haunting this house everyday
I'll get some matches and gasoline
We'll torch this house
And burn those memories
This house was completely empty
Were the ones that filled it with pain
So sick of all the yelling
I think i'm going insane
Take my ears and throw them in a river
Don't want to listen to this shit no more
Take this house and put it up for sale
Cause even if you fix this home
Our lives are already broke.

All Along 
Be careful what you wish for, it just might come true
And I wish that I was still with you.
All that has crumbled I guess it didn't work
Well I guess that I'm still a jerk.
Yet I still think of you every night and day
It don't seem right since you went away
Like a missing puzzle piece I know I'll never find
Pretty sure that I was right.
All Along, with everything that I said.
All Along, can you get that through your head?
All Along, did I do one thing wrong?
All Along, I still tried to be your friend.
How'd you deal with my stupid shit every stupid day?
Some how we got through it every stupid way.
We could talk for hours and hang out now and then,
But in the end were still friends, 
Guess it was for the best, I couldn't joke no more
Anything I said would make you hate me more
You were right and I was wrong unless we'd always fight
But I'm pretty sure that I was right

When we still can't make it through a day
How do you think about tomorrow?
When I'm still stuck in yesterday
Days and days- days go by
Yesterday- I wonder why
days has passed- we still date
It's a Mistake- but everyday's the same
You fake a smile
And tell me everything is OK
The joke is getting old 
I tell you that every single day
How do we make through the week?
When we still can't make it through a day
How do you think about tomorrow?

Bored again in my simple boring life
I think I need a grip

I think I need a tip

Take my pictures off your shelf 
Every thing is so redundant

We were the best of friends
Before your new boy friend
So many years have past
He can kick my ass
Since your new crowd
I haven't seen you around
Never thought I was weak

She was a girl I used to know
She was a girl I used to know
I knew her yeah 
Four years ago

One thing has changed since then
One thing has changed my friend 
She's still as hot as before
But she doesn't like me

I remember when we where friends 
That memory has to end
Everything felt so right 
We'd hang out every night 
But it has all changed since then
You don't even want to be my friend
Never ask to be
Just be here with me

Did you get the letter I sent you?
Wrote with blood, I bleed from my heart.
Sealed with my endless sorrow.
Please reply to my recent crys for help.
I need to * Leave this place behind
Look in the mirror and see happiness in my eyes.
Find a place, I can call my home.
To a place where the streets are paved with gold.
Did you get the postcard I sent you?
See this picture, of this lonely town?
All these problems aren't new to me.
But they'll all be solved cause I'm leaving now.
Smell of booze, empty bottles.
A wall full of, all my idols.
As my mind is burning to the ground.
Can my idols fucking save me now?
So sorry I'm leavin, I'm running away.
Beleve me I'm leaving, theres no hope for me.

Perfect Moment 
The stars are bright
A perfect night
Nothing on earth can ruin this moment
I look in your eyes
Under starlight
It's so perfect
Were so perfect*t
Your eyes
They look so nice
When they shine off the reflection of the stars
I hold your hand
Like your biggest fan
It's so perfect
Were so perfect
My heart is racing
Because that look in your eyes
Were all alone now
And were staring at the sky
It's like a dream
I can't describe the way I'm feeling
The glow the moon sent
The stars were perfect
Nothing on earth can ruin this moment
My heart is racing

Were all alone now

Point Of View 
My life has been watered down
Ever since you came around
Oh how things changed so fast
I knew it just couldn't last
You're what I need to stay alive
Without you I can't survive
The only opposite of false is true
The only opposite of me is you
I know you, way to well
Do you get my point of view
I know you, way to well
Do you see things the way I do
I feel like a shoe without a pair
I'm left untied cause you don't care
You're truly one of a kind 
Not much more that I can find 
Hopefully we can sit down
And talk about everything that went wrong
I'm left with out a clue 
The problem isn't me it's you
Chorus
Do you get my point of view 
Do you see things the way I do
Do you see things through my eyes
Maybe then you'll realize
I don't see things the way you do
Just try to walk in my shoes
I don't see things
I don't see things
I don't see things

If I want to make a change, I better do it now.

Pack my bags and 
Get away cause you dont know the pain im facing. 
Since when, did all these years go by? 
Since when did, all the good things die? 
Since when, did I feel the pain? 
Leave it up to me cause I will save the day.

Clean me off, and gut me dry
Take my insides and everything I swallowed
Give them to my mom to display for the house
Hope my family will remember me.

Dedicate them all, in memory of me

Sow my heart back in my chest
After you ripped it out
I guess I brought this on myself
Should have never let my feelings out
I found half of it*t
Shriveled up on your back portch
The other half is geting stepped out on the floor
I need my heart, it's what makes me......
How could you be
So mean to me?
You know I liked you more that anything
My boat was coming down
You left me there to drown
You were my everything
You were my everything
And when I say take these plyers
And rip away both my eyes
I hate to see you happy
When i'm so fucking lonely
And now since your not my girlfriend
Everything reminds me of you
Do you follow me now?
Won't let this happen again
I'll take a bat and break all those things

everything is not so fine, My options running out 
We were cool just yesterday but now I have my doubts 
I've got this figured out 
Is there a side to take I'm careful where I step
Feel somethings going to break its strange it hasnt yet 
Now our crowd has done its time and now our patience ends
And now I think I see how all these lies tie in 
And you know you can't deny everythings been building up 
Dammed with pretty smiles Hot emotions blowing up and now you've stoked the fire 
If you could just forgive 
Maybe we could still be friends instead you criticize 
Which brings another end
When all your backs are turned its plain no one can see 
All this bullshit piling up from this hypocrisy 
And if you had a piece a shred of decency 
Maybe you could lock wrists once again

Could push us to be more, or at least to try

But the situation forces attraction to more

Blink out the oxygen-hydrogen
Lace it with salt.
Distance yourself from the things you love
Placing the fault.
We're in this together, my thoughts should mean more
You throw me away like I don't know what's right
We have different ideals but we're fighting the same fight
Blink out the oxygen-hydrogen
Lace it with salt.

And do you punch the wall?
Well I don't know cause I'm not there.
This meditation of his heart
Could be a way for you to start
To look at everything around you.
You can't see and you don't know
If you never learn how can you grow?
You won't find the answer lying on the floor.
Breakup, Breakdown, throwing pieces all around
Colliding with the people close to you.
It's not a matter of respect
Or the place for dignity
You're sounding like you're life's a wreck
So would you listen please?

Shoot the words right back at him
Or you could try to baffle him
With invalidated points that he's made.

Better Off Dead 
I woke up surprised and disappointed
To find out I was still me, 
Last night should've killed me.
Took a shower couldn't scrub it off
Tried to scream, I could only cough
I can't trust myself to be my own friend.
Exhausted by the effort it takes to breathe, 
The Whole world is against me
That's what I belive, 
Don't waste your empathy on me
[Chorus]
I'm through puttin one foot in front of the other
I'm do wanna run for cover 
From the moment I wake up til I'm 
Starin at the ceiling trying to sleep
I wonder if I have a soul to keep.
Voices in my head will not turn off
There's a heavy weight on top
Of my chest today, 
I don't want it to go away because,
The moment I let down my guard, 
Life will hit me twice as hard
My mistake, I thought I could have
Just one day off
From pushing boulders up steep hills,
Playin in traffic for cheap thrills 
I don't know what to do
That's why I'm tellin you that
[Chorus]
Sometimes there's nothing on my mind
But everything at one time
Find me sliding backwards down
To where I don't want to be found
Stop with these tests give me some rest
My heart is beating right out of my chest
I do believe I have a soul to keep.

Always be the big man on the floor

Come to your senses, see the light

So many people running around with thir heads on fire
So many burning issures and it makes me fucking tired
Everyone should take a stand and try to change this world
I have-I've got my own plans for all the boys and girls
And it only takes a couple hours a day
And I'm doing something positive for a change
While everybody's freaking out cuz they don't know what to do
I'm gonna do my part and watch cartoons
They're closer to reality than any political zine
They've got more personality than any punk rock scene
The simpsons, Ren and Stimpy, everybody on Southpark
They all tell it like it is and they won't keep me in the dark
I know it looks like I'm getting nothing doen
I'm just sitting on the couch flattening my buns
But i've got a new religion and it's right here in this song
Homer Simpson Is God
We'll all die laughing, like a bunch of little kids

Gonna go see a punk show tonight,
I gotta a heart full of love it's gonna be alright.
Waving my fist and moving my ass,
See the band falling over broken glass.
Why did I have to write this stupid punk song.
Why did she think she was so cool after he died.
Why did I get this fucking ugly tattoo.
Why'd I eat those fucking cheese enchiladas.
Omaha hard guy sends for me,
Says I've been freed and now I agree.
Spiderman needed company.
The gentrified navy saying 1-2-3.
Rebelling is rebellion, rebelling is abominy.
British are coming making eyes, you fuckin' try to
Guess there's only one thing left to do -
Get in their face and tell ya straight out; FUCK YOU.
This is to you, so far beyond.
A bar fight - never right - save the gun.
I got a great big fuck on city hall.
Running butt naked to the local mall
Why did I have to write this stupid punk song.
Why did she think she was so cool after he died.
Why did I get this fucking ugly tattoo.
Why'd I eat those cheese enchiladas.
Gonna go see a punk show tonight,

Dancing With Myself 
On the floors of Tokyo
Down in London town's a go-go
With the record selection
And the mirror's reflection
I'm a-dancing with myself
Oh, when there's no one else in sight
In the crowded, lonely night
Well, I wait so long for my love vibration
And I'm dancing with myself
Oh, oh, oh dancing with myself
Oh, oh, oh dancing with myself
Well there's nothing to prove
And there's nothing to lose
And I'm dancing with myself
Oh, oh, oh, oh
If I looked all over the world
And there's every type of girl
But your empty eyes seem to pass me by
And leave me dancing with myself
So let's sink another drink
And it'll give me time to think
If I had a chance, I'd ask the someone to dance
And I'd be dancing with myself
Oh, oh, oh dancing with myself
Oh, oh, oh dancing with myself
If I had a chance, I'd ask someone to dance
And I'm dancing with myself
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Entertainment Vs. Enlightenment 
I know you want me to entertain
Don't want me to be lame don't wanna hear me say
Stuff that might sober you up
And make you give a fuck 
Too bad, you're out of luck! 
Because I'm not that funny of a guy, and besides
I've got too many questions in my mind 
Like why do I so often resent the world I'm living in? 
And am I boring you yet with the same old shit again? 
Did you know that change is within reach? 
And it starts with ourselves.
The stuff we learn and the stuff we teach!
The willingness to be honest with ourselves
And everybody else is the first step to cooling this hell
And did you know that music is a very powerful thing?
And lyrics can be more than just mindless singing?
And maybe you can't change the world, but you can change yourself
And the music should be fun, but sometimes there's something else... 
Entertainment vs. enlightenment 
You learn the words to every single verse
Entertainment vs. enlightenment 
But it still doesn't make a dent 
Entertainment vs. enlightenment 
Somebody took the time to write these lines
Entertainment vs. enlightenment 
So think about what they meant yeah, 
And did you know that music is a very powerful thing? 
And it's a lot more fun than sitting around whacking (I don't know about that) 
And maybe you can't change the world, but you can change yourself
And music should be fun, but sometimes there's something else... 
The things you call important are making me see red 
The patches that you wear and the spikes on your head are nothing but a fashion show 
And you judge everyone on a sliding scale of "punk" like you were the first one 
You say music with a message is a fucking bore? 
I guess it takes away from the punk points you score 
But you hate it cause it makes you think I think you hate it cause it makes you think.

Fifteen 
Fifteen years old and already on your own 
A house that isn't happy doesn't feel much like a home 
So you take things in your own hands, you're making your own choices 
Gave up trying to talk to them cause they wouldn't hear your voice 
Fifteen going on forty, but nowhere near grown up 
Between a rock and a hard place the situation sucks 
You aren't the first to be there, you sure won't be the last 
Catch 22, your future shaped by your past 
Acknowledge me as a human being 
Look inside and find the love 
I don't understand the pain I feel 
Look inside and find the love 
Fifteen going on forty, but nowhere near grown up 
Between a rock and a hard place the situation sucks 
You aren't the first to be there, you sure won't be the last

You're a Winner, a loser, a glory confuser 
Sometimes you wanna be all alone, don't be such a loser 
Acknowledge me as a human being 
Look inside and find the love 
I don't understand the pain I feel 
Look inside and find the love 
I recognize your struggle I see through your pleading eyes 
Camouflaged by an anxious smile your paid identified 
It looks like the end of the world is here for you 
Now you're thinking about enternal rendezvous 
But listen to me please, don't kill yourself today 
Be strong, I know you'll pull through someway

Fuck Ya'll, We're From Texas 
Humidity doesn't bother me 
Neither does the pouring rain 
Cause 5 minutes later it's better or worse 
But it never stays the same 
It's hot and it's dusty 
My armpits are musty 
And my cowboy hat is soaked 
A man on a three wheeled bike 
Sets me up with a 50 cent snow cone 
At a quarter to two eatin' Mexican food 
Free chips and beans and rice 
SMILE WHEN YOU SAY TEXAS 
And everything will be alright 
We've got Willie Nelson 
And Serial Killers 
And King Of The Hill 
And the moonshine distillers 
And Texas is the only place to have killed 
The president in his car 
Heavy laws for petty crimes 
Paying off probation fees 
A system designed to fuck you up 
That's why our prisons are our 
Fastest growing indusrty (fuck the system) 
In 1980 John Travolta 
Filmed Urban Cowboy here 
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places 
And drinking Gilley's beer

Happy Song 
I'm happy being me, are you happy being you? 
If you live your life for someone else, you've got a lot to lose 
Personal identity is something I hold dear 
Won't bow to insecurity, I will not live in fear 
I'm happy with myself, yeah man, I feel alright 
And we can disagree but we don't have to fight 
I'm happy with myself, yeah man, I feel alright 
And we can disagree but we don't have to fight. 
And if you're just so hardcore that you can't take a joke 
Then my advice is to lighten up, don't give yourself a stroke 
But if making something out of nothing is what you wanna do 
Then you can have the headaches... and fuck you 
I'm happy with myself, and man, I feel alright 
And we can disagree but we don't have to fight 
I'm happy with myself hey man, is that alright? 
And who told you that you do everything right? 
Do what you wanna do to make a better day 
Do what you wanna do to find a better way 
Do what you wanna do I hope you'll be fine 
Do something for yourself while you still have the time. 
I'm happy with myself, and man, I feel alright

How I Became The Jerk 
Now here's a song for all of you 
Who hate the world the way I do 
And all the whiney old school farts 
And the sophomoric new school fools 
And the cliques that rise up in between 
The different sections of the scene 
Talking too loud and self too self absorbed 
To see their own idiocy 
But I'm full of it too... 
A bag of hot air just like you. 
Idealism burning the world down 
Like I'm better than all the suit and tie guys downtown 
Anybody can dress like an asshole 
Anybody can have an opinion 
Everybody can become what they hate 
So fuck everybody 
Sixth fucking grade 
The year that all the world's evil and trickle down 
Pressured to "be somebody" manifested itself in my peer group 
Petty shit talking dress codes 
And early installments of class division 
And patriarchal value? 
I guess our parents were proud 
But hey look at us now! 
We've got the attitude down 
Silence everyone who doesn't think like me 
I'm a ship with no sails yea you might call me silly but... 
Anybody can dress like an asshole 
Anybody can have an opinion 
Everybody can become what they hate 
So fuck everybody.. except me of course 
Ah yes, the angry breakdown of the song 
All you before me must stand in awe of my 
Angry pasturising and angst ridden growls.. 
Genuflect my brothers and sisters and in-betweeners 
For I hold the microphone, and therefore 
I AM SOMEBODY 
I'm trying to sound convincing (listern to this guy yell) 
But I'm just not that angry (what's he tryin' to sell) 
My specialty, lip service (nobody listerns to you) 
Hide behind popular politics (no wonder you cleared the room) 
That's how I became the Jerk 
That's how I became the Jerk 
That's how I became the Jerk 
That's how I became the Jerk.

Ida Know 
I get knocked down 
I get back up 
But I'm not gonna run away. 
I've got too much to think about 
To even try to hide 
So when my life gets way too big 
Well fuck it, that's my life. 
If you wanna dance 
You gotta pay the band 
What once was hard to understand 
Is something I've accepted 
As a condition to this life 
THE TRUTH WILL CHANGE AS SOON AS YOU FEEL ORGANIZED INSIDE 
But who am I to give you direction anyway? 
Stupid me trying to speak but stuttering 
You see for yourself, or you fuck yourself 
Ida know nothing no more. 
There are times when I feel like it's time 
To hold my nose and shut my mouth 
(shut your mouth shit-head) 
Cause people talk so much shit 
You see it on their teeth 
When they smile 
When they talk 
The conversation stinks 
I don't talk too loud 
(not like I used to) 
The more I see the more I think 
Experience breaks me down to 
A lever that helps me recognize 
And see things as they be 
I can study what I see 
And what It means to me 
But who am I to give you direction anyway? 
Stupid me trying to speak but stuttering 
You see for yourself, or you fuck yourself 
Ida know nothing no more. 
They never knew that I existed 
'Til they saw something they didn't like 
Now they try to drag me down 
With all their rumours and their words of spite 
Though it bums me out a little 
It don't matter too much what they say 
Cause it's never said to my face 
But they keep on talkin' anyway 
You respect would be nice 
But I don't need it 
Disapprove of my life 
But I still live it.

I Hate Punk Rock 
Here's a little story about a punk named Jed 
Greasy stinky hair stuck out his fuckin' head 
Arrogant and macho and stupid as can be 
Always quick to tell me he's more punk than me 
This is an example of what a jerk he is 
He think he's some kind of punk rock whiz 
He said if I was really punk I'd listen to The Germs 
I smelled his stinky breath and I started to squirm 
I hate punk rock 
I hate punk rock 
I hate punk rock 
I do I do 
I hate punk rock 
I hate punk rock

Because of guys like you 
I remember one time I was dancin' at a show 
A poppy kind of band and Jed said they blow 
That stuff is for guys who just want to get laid 
He asked me what I thought but didn't wait for me to say 
This is what I think about his attitude 
He doesn't have to be so snotty fucking rude 
And thinking for yourself doesn't mean you have to be a jerk 
Being arrogant and ignorant doesn't take much work 
I hate punk rock

It's Still Rock And Roll To Me 
What's the matter with the clothes I'm wearing
Can't you tell that your tie's too wide
Maybe I should buy some old tab collars
Welcome back to the age of jive
Where have you been hidin' out lately, honey
You can't dress trashy 'till you spend a lot of money
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound, funny
But it's still rock and roll to me
What's the matter with the car I'm driving
Can't you tell that it's out of style
Should I get a set of white wall tires
Are you gonna cruise the miracle mile
Nowadays you can't be too sentimental
Your best bet's a true baby blue Continental
Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk
It's still rock and roll to me
Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers
Cause it's always been the same old scene
There's a new band in town
But you can't get the sound from a story in a magazine
Aimed at your average teen
How about a pair of pink sidewinders
Or a bright orange pair of pants
Well, you could really be a Beau Brummel baby
If you only give it half a chance
Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers
You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers
Next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me
What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing
Don't you know that they're out of touch
Should I try to be a straight A student
If you are, then you think too much
Don't you know about the new fashion honey
All you need are looks and a whole lotta money
It's the next phase, new wave, dance craze, anyways
It's still rock and roll to me
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound, funny
But it's still rock and roll to me

Just Like Heaven 
"Show me how you do that trick 
The one that makes me scream" she said 
"The one that makes me laugh" she said 
And threw her arms around my neck 
"Show me how you do it and I promise you 
I promise that I'll run away with you 
I'll run away with you" 
Spinning on that dizzy edge 
I kissed her face and kissed her head 
And dreamed of all the different ways I had 
To make her glow 
"Why are you so far away?" she said 
"Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you? 
That I'm in love with you?" 
You 
Soft and only 
You 
Lost and lonely 
You 
Strange as angels 
Dancing in the deepest oceans 
Twisting in the water 
You're just like a dream... 
Daylight licked me into shape 
I must have been asleep for days 
And moving lips to breathe her name 
I opened up my eyes 
And found myself alone 
Alone 
Alone above a raging sea 
That stole the only girl I loved 
And drowned her deep inside of me 
You 
Soft and only 
You 
Lost and lonely 
You 
Just like heaven

Kirk Cameron Sings The Blues 
Well I know I'm past that age,
But I've got growing pains again.
It's not that physical this time, I know.
It's something from within,
It hurts to think about the friends and family
I had to leave behind,
When my undeveloped body
Got stuck with an older mind.
When my play time got cut short,
Just like everybody else's did,
I had to leave that kid behind,
And suffer this extended adolescence.
I'm at the age where society says I should be a man,
But I don't think I can, don't wanna be a man.
I can't ignore the fact the more I see the less I understand,
I guess I should have a plan, I don't wanna be a man.
So now my soul is duct taped to this body
Whose life will someday end.
I've found a limited amount of answers,
But the questions never end.
And my ineptitude is starting to show,
The pain continues to grow
As I trip over my words again and again and again and again and again
But I'm determined not to settle for the mess
That sorrows me, hate and fear and all the rest
Will still go on but without me!
I don't wanna be a man, I don't wanna be a man!
So many things I'm supposed to be,
But they've got nothing to do with me!
I don't wanna be a man!
I don't wanna be a man!
I don't wanna be a man!

When my dad was 25,
He had a helpless 2.5.
And our city was still growing,
And they had no way of knowing
That this place would turn to shit
And they'd have to hand it to their kids.
Enter the 25 year old me
Whose eyes still have yet to see
What's to gain
From minimum wage
Productivity!
And I'm still learning to barely survive.
Getting used to scraping by.
So what's it like to not be broke?
Where'd the money go?
Don't ask me 'cause I don't know.
So where'd the money go?
Well don't ask me 'cause I don't know!
But the old regime is living well,
And I'm running out of things to sell out to!
Kid, I hate to have to fuck somebody hard,
Or you compromise your spirit,
Or you commercialize your art.
And if you only live for cash,
Well then you can kiss my ass,
Because you are the problem here!
Am I making myself clear?
Am I making myself clear?
So what's it like to not be broke?

Learn to swallow hard so we won't cry

People Are Stupid 
I'm surrounded by Idiots everyday 
Frustrated by the games that people play 
Confused by what the t.v says I need 
Lost in space and ugly too 
People act like they've been sniffing glue 
Never questioning the things that they believe 
Freedom of choice must be a joke 
Just look at all the people that cannot cope 
I've got something I want to say to them 
There's a lot of stuff that I can do 
That doesn't mean I have to impose on you 
If you take offense to common sense 
That's your problem 
I can do what I want 
Listern to some Slayer and play nintendo all night long 
Racism sucks and so do you 
If you hate somebody cause they're not like you 
And that goes for homophobia, zenophobia, and classism too 
I can sit around and masturbate 
Have different coloured friends that I don't hate 
It doesn't matter if you don't approve 
I can stick my finger up my nose 
Never take a bath or change my clothes 
And my underarms can ruin someone's day 
I can ride a float in the gay parade 
Terrorize the christian right for a day

Plastic 
When I look into the eyes of the tough punk guys 
With their stupid bondage belts 
And the girls accessorize 
With lots of little spikes and neat hair dyes 
It's a whole subculture easy to commercialize 
"The Revolution" wont come 
Cause everybody's dumb 
Drunk, fucked up on drugs-look at what it's come to:, 
Tiny microcosm of a big stupid world 
Short sighted, opinionated, gullible boys and girls! 
This music's only rock-n-roll 
Wont change the world or save your soul 
Uniform Identity? 
This trademark rebellion's not for me 
Will there ever be a time when time doesn't matter 
When a lack of money means your dreams aren't shattered 
When chemicals don't take the edge off of life 
And confidence keeps you whole inside 
Can we ever look forward to not being bored 
To not being scared to open closed doors 
To love without holding anything back 
To trust and share and stay intact? 
Give me love don't give me hate 
I'll stay aware and not sedate 
Addicted to my sleepyhead 
When it's time to wake up 
I'll stay in bed 
You can sell your soul for rock and roll 
Turn off your brain 
Wait to grow old 
Get a good job 
How much plastic can you buy? 
I dunno but here we go 
Freedom is the easiest thing to lose 
How many options can you choose? 
From the choices they've already made for you? 
Addicted to a sleepyhead 
Some of us will sleep until we're dead 
Trade in one uniform to wear another 
That smothers you but never keeps you covered 
Freedom is the easiest thing to lose

Popular Opinion 
Some people live their life 
Based on what they think is wrong or right 
No matter if their views are rejected 
Others make decisions 
Based on what they think is popular 
As long as what they say is accepted 
Another day to ponder the truth 
Another day to lie 
I wonder what I'm gonna do 
I've got the rest of my life 
Our little subculture is full of this bullshit 
With everybody shouting to be heard 
Isn't it ironic, everybody has an answer 
And there hasn't been anything learned 
Another day to ponder the truth 
Another day to lie 
I wonder what I'm gonna do 
I've got the rest of my life 
I won't be a part of it, I can think for myself 
I won't be a part of it, I can think for myself 
I won't be a part of it, I can think for myself 
I will stand apart from it, I can think for myself

Punk Rocks In Your Head 
You've got all the right patches,
none of your records have scratches.
You've been to all the hip shows
and you're wearing just the right clothes.
And when I see you at a show,
the conversation doesn't flow.
Something is wrong and can't see
just why you have to be so mean.
You used to be nice, now you've got punk rocks in your head.
Now you've got punk rocks in your head.
Now you've got punk rocks in your head.
Now you've got punk rocks in your head.
We started out knowing nothing,
a bunch of dorks new to the scene.
We all bitch about the scene,
but now there's something inbetween
You're quoting everybody else,
you're not thinking for yourself
just like everybody else.
You're just another dumbass with punk rocks in your head.
Now you've got punk rocks in your head.
Now you've got punk rocks in your head.
Now you've got punk rocks in your head.
What is so different about you,
exactly what do I have to do
to measure up to your standards,
to escape your slander.
Forget it, you can save your breath,
your stupid game bores me to death.
And I know you'll never get it,
your attitude it makes me sick.
You're such an asshole, now you've got punk rocks in your head.
Now you've got punk rocks in your head.
Now you've got punk rocks in your head.
Now you've got punk rocks in your head.
Now you've got punk rocks in your head.
Now you've got punk rocks in your head.

You used to be nice, now you've got punk rocks in your head.

Still Rock 'n' Roll To Me 
What's the matter with the clothes I'm wearing? 
Can't you tell that your tie's too wide? 
Maybe I should buy some old tab collars? 
Welcome back to the age of jive 
Where have you been hidin' out lately, honey? 
You can't dress trashy till you spend a lot of money 
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound 
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me 
What's the matter with the car I'm driving? 
Can't you tell that it's out of style? 
Should I get a set of white wall tires? 
Are you gonna cruise a miracle mile? 
Nowadays you can't be too sentimental 
You best bet's a true baby blue Continental 
Hot funk, cool punk, even if it's old junk 
It's still rock and roll to me 
Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers 
'Cause it's always been the same old scene 
There's a new band in town 
But you can't get the sound from a story in a magazine... 
Aimed at your average teen 
How about a pair of pink sidewinders 
And a bright orange pair of pants? 
You could really be a Beau Brummel baby 
If you just give it half a chance 
Don't waste your money on a new set of speakers 
You get more mileage from a cheap pair of sneakers 
Next phase, new wave , dance craze, anyways 
It's still rock and roll to me 
What's the matter with the crowd I'm seeing? 
Don't you know that their out of touch? 
Should I try to be a straight 'A' student? 
If you are then you think too much 
Don't you know about the new fashion honey? 
All you need are looks and a whole lotta money 
It's the next phase, new wave , dance craze, anyways 
It's still rock and roll to me 
Everybody's talkin' 'bout the new sound 
Funny, but it's still rock and roll to me

Subhumanitarian Homewrecked Blues 
I won't turn away
From the indifference and selfishness
And carelessness and irresponsibility
These are the downfalls of human nature 
And I just want to break free
And Im wondering where to start
And we all think we're so smart
But I'm still here and you're still here
And neither one of us has changed the world
And though I've and I've tried and I hope it all turns out good
It didn't turn out like I thought it would
Sometimes I don't know what to say
But I still won't turn away
Sometimes I wish I could look it in the face
But this ignorance is not confined
It's all over the place
It's inside me,and it's inside you
I never do the things I say I'm gonna do
Sometimes my fear just runs my life
And all I want is some place to hide
But as long as you and me are here
We can change a little part of our world
If we can't make it better
At least we wont make it worse
It didn't turn out like I thought it should
But I still won't turn away
Sometimes I don't know what to think
Sometimes I don't know what to say
But I still won't turn away

The Heroin Song 
How can something so cliche, something so pathetic 
Something so stupid be regarded as poetic 
With mum on methadone and daddy on the nod 
It's a picture full of death a syringe full of snot 
You shoot up, you die. You shoot up, you die 
And if your body lives, then you die inside 
Another paper, another shot 
Is the rust worth the risk, fuck no it's not 
Our generation should be smart enough to know 
The syringe, the gun, your life you blow 
You shoot up, you die, you shoot up, you die 
A false sense of security, you shoot up you die. 
And now it's too late to change your mind. 
Your life is empty, you fill it up with smack 
Too much one night you end up on your back 
You say you don't care, you're not afraid of dying 
Now you're on a respirator and all your friends are crying 
And now it's too late to change your mind!

Throwaway 
Back in the day you say you had it made 
Hanging out all night and getting laid 
All the colours had shown brighter 
And your heart was so much lighter 
Back in the day you say things weren't so lame 
Now everybody seems to be the same 
There's nothing happy here 
And I don't think you're thinking clear 
Your attitude is self-defeating 
Your history's not worth repeating 
Your life was just as lame back then 
As you say it is now 
Your rose coloured glasses deceive you 
Reminisce all night 
I'm not listerning to you 
Cause 5 years from now will be the same old story anyhow 
Back in they day you were a whiney little fuck 
You hated the whole world for your bad luck 
Your situation sucked you didn't change it 
Now you tell a story but you rearrange it 
Back in the day your rut wasn't so deep 
That is the memory that you choose to keep 
As you grow older it gets deeper 
Try to climb out but the walls are steeper 
Your attitude is self-defeating 
Your history's not worth repeating 
Your life was just as lame back then 
As you say it is now 
Your rose coloured glasses deceive you 
Reminisce all night 
I'm not listerning to you 
Cause 5 years from now will be the same old story anyhow 
You've got a life to live right now 
You've got a self to build somehow 
Trying to avoid the future? 
Are you just afraid of failure? 
I won't listern to your stories when 
I see you've been killing time again 
Your attitude is self-defeating 
Your history's not worth repeating

Urine Nation 
I was 8 years old at the Astro Dome
Waiting in line to pee pee
The urinal line seemed to take forever
Then it finally came down to me
I unzipped my toughskins
And pulled out my little wee wee
Some drunk guy said "Hurry Up KID!"
But I couldn't spring a leak
I can't pee in front of you
But you can pee in front of me
I can't help it I've got stage fright
I've got Urinary Anxiety
And so it has been for 15 years
And I can't seem to shake my pee pee fears
I've gotta have a lock on the bathroom door
Before I can make the water fall on the floor
Can't wait for the moment in the shower
Hot water on my chest full power
Laugh as the lemonade hits the porcelain
I can't pee in front of you
But you can pee in front of me
I can't help it I've got stage fright
I've got Urinary Anxiety
I'm getting better at breaking boundaries
I'm learning to let myself be free
But whether I want this war or not
We'll just have to wait and see
When I can whip it out anywhere
Whether or not anybody's there
When I can just relax and pee
Then I can declare victory
I'm on a mission
I don't need no permission
I can pee in front of you
And you can pee in front of me
I ain't got no more stage fright
No Urinary Anxiety

Which Way To Go Kaboom 
It's the 21st century and Elvis is still dead 
And we're not wearing oxygen bubbles around our heads 
And New Year's wasn't doom 
And not a damn thing went kaboom 
And the party just fizzled out and we went home 
It's the 21st century and God still hides away 
In the clouds from down here civil leaders still love to say 
That God likes to wave our flag 
And he likes it when you beat up fags 
And Jesus was white even though it's not geographically probable 
It's hard enough just to believe in anyone that isn't me 
Everyone's got their convictions 
Settle for the contradictions 
And all I really know right now is 
I got no map to follow 
And I can't see into tomorrow 
I don't know which direction to set sail 
I'm always under construction 
In constant danger of malfunction 
I got no backup plan in case I fail 
It's the 21st century, the outlook's pretty sick 
Take a temperature drop, what do you think will do the trick 
He said humans are a disease 
How we got here is a mystery 
We need a planetary penicillin shot 
Religion is crowd control, there's always TV 
I had a lifetime of Uncle Sam confusing me 
And if I ever have a kid 
I hope it doesn't go through all the shit I did 
Just trying to make sense of random rules 
A lot of broken hearts, a lot of broken minds 
We break em fast, and rebuild them slow 
Pushed and pulled in all directions 
Illuminate your imperfections 
And all I really know right now is 
I got no map to follow 
And I can't see into tomorrow 
I don't know which direction to set sail 
I'm always under construction 
In constant danger of malfunction 
I got no backup plan in case I fail 
Held together by vice grips and duct tape 
Don't know what time it is, but I think it's getting late 
Isolated from my society 
Motivated by my anxiety 
I got no map to follow 
And I can't see into tomorrow 
And I don't wanna brave the dead-end trail 
I'm always under construction 
In constant danger of malfunction 
I got no backup plan in case I fail 
I got no map to follow 
And I can't see into tomorrow 
I got no map to follow 
And I can't see into tomorrow 
I got no map to follow 
I got no map to follow 
I got no map to follow

Afraid 
Afraid
(Crowe)
Waiting here somedays, and looking inside.
You can't live your life on your own love,
Well not all the time
I need somebody, from outside of me,
To come and give me all the things that I have used up
Wrapping other peoples sin
So afraid to begin, so afraid to start again,
Lost in time, held in argument,
Weathers fine as long as you don't speak.
The guilt that I've gathered,
Is like my phrase book of doubt,
Over your shoulder and far away,
The pressure mounts
Now that you've said you will love that little girl for life.
Ah, did you really understand what you were giving away
And how your soul knows you
So afraid to begin, so afraid to start again,
Lost in time, held in argument,
Weathers fine, as long as you don't speak
The shadows stretch the floor,
And I don't seem to know what I'm here for.
There's a moment in Noahs arc when panic sets in,
You're afraid of the dark...so afraid
So afraid to begin, so afraid to start again,
Lost in time, held in argument,
Weathers fine, as long as you don't speak
As long as you don't speak,
As long as you don't speak your mind.30 Odd Foot of Grunts Lyrics Index

All The White Circles 
All The White Circles
(Crowe)
Take all the white circles from a deep dark blue background,
Throw them into the air, just to see where they come down.
I said there was emotion, I didn't get specific,
I'm told cowgirls know when to sing and when to listen
So I explode in a pattern and I count when I pray,
The curtains are open but I'm not on my way.
I'm still back on the sideline looking into the house,
It takes more than a nice smile to make me walk out.
Take all the white circles from a deep dark blue background,
Throw them into the air, just to see where they come down.
I said there was emotion, I didn't get specific,
I'm told cowgirls know when to sing and when to listen
Hey prince of innocence, you're full of excuses,
Wrestling desire won't light the fuses
And taking the time to construct how you're feeling,
Goes against all you love and all you believe in
I tried being cryptic to get your attention,
You ignored me
Does that mean I'm too cryptic to mention?
If we're a team what's our intention?
Curing your mind or your crimes with prevention,
Pretending that time doesn't matter
It's just you and me
Take all the white circles from a deep dark blue background,
Throw them into the air, just to see where they come down.
I said there was emotion, I didn't get specific,
I'm told cowgirls know when to sing and when to listen30 Odd Foot of Grunts Lyrics Index

Big jet planes don't fly over me
I'm one of the lucky ones
I live in a quiet street
She's all middle class
And Bertolt Brecht
Her first time in Amsterdam
She came back a fuckin' mess
But it's all over - that's all gone
Time shades the pony and travels on
For all of this singin' she's a real one
Loves punchin' things and swallows inspiration
At least she can be inspired
Smart enough and deep enough to kiss with that fire
Smart enough and deep enough to hold my desire
Strong enough and street enough to grieve love's invention
She doesn't break, I bet she bruises
She doesn't break, I bet she bruises
In an earthquake, I know she'd cruise it
Big jet planes don't fly over me
I'm usually in them
Looking down on your street
Know so many people I've never met
The first time I go to Amsterdam,
I'm coming back a fuckin' mess
But it's all over - that's all gone
Time shades the pony and travels on
For all of this singin' she's a real one
Loves punchin' things and swallows inspiration
At least she can be inspired
Smart enough and deep enough to kiss with that fire
Smart enough and deep enough to hold my desire

I'm the unhappiest soul in the whole milky way
I'll twinkle when you look at me and I'll
Burn the night till day
I long to be
Back on earth
Who was I building that castle for?
Who was I building?
I look for love
Like it's Easter time
Too many places
Where I might find
The sweetest of the sweet things
That the good lord provides
What was I building?
Couldn't I decide?
What was I building?
That magic kiss
So rare when you find it
You find it in the last place
You could ever unbind it
A soul mate taken from you
By the sorry situation
Impetuous, restlessness
Becomes plain desperation
Who was I building that castle for?
Who was I building that castle for?30 Odd Foot of Grunts Lyrics Index

Circus 
Circus
(Smotherman  Walker)
I went to the circus
To waste some time
The barker was yelling what's on
So I laid up my money
And I waited in line
The circus was just like home
The crowd had gathered
So I walked on by
To backstage places unknown
I could tell by the fire
And the moon and the sky
The circus was just like home
There were animal cages
And animal tails
Woman who move like a poem
With their vampire faces
And beautiful nails
The circus felt just like home
The strong man was dancing
In the clothes that he borrowed from a girl in the chorus line
And the gypsy was drinking like there's no tomorrow with the
Ringmaster who was drinkng faster
Blessing everybody with wine
Behind at the lion tamer running around
Looking like a Christian in Rome
They were loading the cannon with the Portuguese clown
And the circus was just like home
The strong man was dancing in the clothes that he borrowed
From a girl in the chorus line
And the gypsy was drinking like there's no tomorrow with the
Ringmaster who was drinkng faster
Blessing everybody with wine
I went to the circus
It was cash in advance
The barker was yelling what's on
He said come to the circus
You can smell the romance
See all the tigers and elephants dance
Thousands of suckers paid up for the chance
And the circus was just like home30 Odd Foot of Grunts Lyrics Index

My eyes get weary I feel like crying

I got on my travelling face
I know the obstacles
Adapt to the pace
And the different shape
Of a bottle of beer
Four months now stretch out before me
No one in my heart is going to call me from the other room
Expecting me to move

How long was it last time
We tortured each other
To the point of cryin' when we finally touched
Too late in the day
As we so often do
You know I love you
But do you trust me?
She angles her head
Do you trust me?

Say, more than you know

There once was a young boy
Who was photographed at 13
For Life magazine
As ballroom dancer
I have often been asked if that was me
I have often wondered if that was me

What's the measurement on thinking the same thing
What's the chance they'd ever know

He trains snakes for a living
He was arrested and fined
